            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE to the READER.</head>
            <p>THE Main and Principal Deſign of making this following Collection, was to preſerve en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire in this Second Volume ſome other Excellent Tracts, of equal eſteem and value with the former, (which made that Book ſo much obtain among the Learned and Curious, as that the whole Impreſſion of it is already near ſold;) And as it cannot but be very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s in the reading of them, who do yet ſo ſenſibly remember what we then felt, and looked for worſe to fall on us every day than other; ſo it will certainly be of great Benefit and Advantage to our Poſterities in future, who may conſiderably profit themſelves by our Misfortunes.</p>
            <p>This is a Collection, that <hi>in the general</hi> will ſet forth the true and Legal Conſtitution of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, Famous <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, which, <q>of all the Countries in <hi>Europe,</hi>

                  </note> where I was ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, (ſays the Noble Lord of <hi>Argenton</hi>) is no-where ſo well managed, the People no-where leſs obnoxious to Violence, nor their Houſes leſs liable to the Deſolations of War, than in <hi>England,</hi> for there <hi>the Calamities fall only upon the Authors.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>'Twas a true Obſervation that this Great Man made of the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of our Gallant Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors in his days; how miſerable the Succeſſive Generations have deviated from the vertue of their ſteps, how much the ſtrict Piety of their Manners, and the noble Bravery of their Spirits, Tempers and Complexions, have been enervated and diſſolved by the later looſeneſs, ſupine careleſneſs and degeneracy, the preſent Age hath great reaſon to bewail; and, 'tis hoped, that thoſe to come will be hereby cautioned to grow wiſer and better by thoſe paſt Follies and Miſcarriages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In particular,</hi> Here will be ſeen the dangerous Conſequences of keeping up a ſtanding Army within theſe Kingdoms in a time of Peace, without conſent of Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Truſt, Power and Duty of Grand Juries, and the great Security of <hi>Engliſh-mens</hi> Lives, in their faithful diſcharge thereof.</p>
            <p>The Right of the Subject to Petition their King for Redreſs of their Wrongs and Oppreſſions, and that Acceſs to the Sovereign ought not to be ſhut up in caſe of any Diſtreſſes of his People.</p>
            <p>The Spring of all our late private Miſchievous Councils and Cabals, and the Special Tools that were thought fitteſt for Preferment, to be imployed (under a colour of Authority) to put all thoſe concerted De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns in motion and execution.</p>
            <p>The Parliament's Care in appointing a Committee to examine the Proceedings of the Forward and Active Judges upon ſeveral Caſes that were brought before them of grand importance to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal, Peace and Safety of the Nation;
<note place="margin">☞</note> and the Reſolution of the Houſe of Commons (upon their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port) That the Judges ſaid Proceedings were Arbitrary and Illegal, deſtructive to Publick Juſtice, a high and manifeſt Violation of their Oaths, a Scandal to the Reformation, an uſurpation of the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Power to themſelves, and a means to ſubvert the Fundamental Laws of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And the ſeveral Grievances that this Nation hath long been labouring under, for the Advancement of Popery, Arbitrary Dominion, and the unmeaſurable Growth and Power of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are likewiſe interſperſed in this Volume ſeveral Matters of Fact relating to the Male-Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Affairs in <hi>Scotland,</hi> under Duke <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> and his Favourites; as alſo a Large and Faithful Account of the late Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Tryal, Eſcape and Sentence, with divers other things for the better clearing of his Caſe.</p>
            <p>In a word, This Collection will diſcover to us the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of the <hi>Monarchy</hi> in the two Late Reigns, and the Abuſed Truſt of Government in thoſe Princes, by a Diſpencing Power both in Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Matters, to Tyrannize over their Subjects; who in the mean while were taught, by ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me <hi>Paſſive-Obedience</hi> and <hi>Non-Reſiſtance</hi> Doctrine-holders, That all their Duty was tamely to ſubmit to, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently ſigh under their daily Sufferings and Oppreſſions; and, I think we bore them ſo long, till we were within one throw more of looſing all our good old Laws and Conſtitutions, and even the Government it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Our Miſeries were lately ſo great and many, (as you will find here) that it is impoſſible for any one better and more fully to expreſs them, than in the words of a very Learned and Judicious Author, who hath thus given us a juſt and lively Repreſentation of them.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Our Laws <hi>(ſays he)</hi> were trampled under foot, and upon the matter aboliſhed, to ſet up <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure</hi> in their room, under the Cant and Pretence of Diſpencing Power. Our Conſtitution was overthrown by the Trick of New Charters, and by cloſetting, and corrupting Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Men were required, under pain of the higheſt Diſpleaſure, to conſent,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Some Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the moſt proper way of raiſing Money in the preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture. Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> Octob. <hi>1691.</hi>
                  </note> and concur to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing their Religion, and the Liberty of their Countrey. The worthieſt, honeſteſt, and braveſt Men in <hi>England,</hi> had been barbarouſly murthered; and to aggravate the Injuſtice which was done them, all bad been varniſhed over with a Colour of Law, and the Formality of Tryals; not unlike the Caſe of <hi>Naboth</hi> and <hi>Ahab.</hi> Thoſe whom the Law declared Traytors, were, in defiance of the National Authority, introduced into our Councils, and the Conduct of Affairs put into their hands. Our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities were invaded by open Force; thoſe who were in the lawful poſſeſſion of the Government of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, turned out, and Papiſts ſent thither in their room: And if that Attempt had throughly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered, the Churches and Pulpits would ſoon have followed. It were vain to go about to enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Particulars. In a word, the Nation was undone. All was loſt. The Judges were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned, or threatned to declare, that the King was Maſter of all the Laws; and the Biſhops were required to publiſh this <hi>New-created Prerogative</hi> in all the Churches of <hi>England</hi> by the Mouths of the Clergy; which when ſome of them refuſed to do, repreſenting to the King, with the utmoſt ſubmiſſion and modeſty, that neither Conſcience nor Juſtice permitted them to do what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, they were proſecuted at Law, as if they had been guilty of ſome great Crime. Letters were written and intercepted, by which it appeared evidently, that the <hi>change</hi> of our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> was determined, and that <hi>Popery</hi> was to be brought in with all ſpeed, leaſt the opportunity
<pb facs="tcp:48501:3"/>ſhould be loſt. And for the better compaſſing this pious deſign, our Civil, and Parliamentary Rights were to be taken away, <hi>in Ordine ad Spiritualia.</hi> And when the Nation, and thoſe who were concerned for it, being terrified by the greatneſs of the danger, would have compounded ſo far, as to have taken away the Penal Laws againſt Papiſts, and ſo have ſet them upon a Level with other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects, provided the Teſt might have been continued, and the Government ſecured from falling into the hands of that Faction, all ſuch offers were deſpiſed and rejected with ſcorn: Nor would any thing content the <hi>Bigotry</hi> and Arbitrary humour of thoſe who were then in the Saddle, leſs than the total enſlaving of the Nation, and the Re-eſtabliſhment of that Idolatrous Religion, from which our Anceſtors had freed themſelves with ſo much Bravery and Generoſity in the beginning of the laſt Century.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In this deplorable Condition, His then Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> found theſe Kingdoms, when he came to relieve us from the greateſt Oppreſſions; He heard the <hi>Voice of the People,</hi> that earneſtly invited him over to their Reſcue, and taking it (as undoubtedly it was) for the <hi>Voice of God,</hi> complied, and God hath made us All happy with the deſired ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Had the late King <hi>James</hi> ſtuck firmly to the Intereſts of his People, He would thereby have eaſily ſecured his own; and, if they could have found He had had (what he aſſured both Houſes of Parliament,

            </p>
            <p>But, unhappy Prince! He was reſolvedly bent, by the force of his own Superſtition, the Power and Influence of the Prieſts and Jeſuits that continually attended on him, and the Directions from <hi>France,</hi> upon the total Deſtruction of our Reformed Religion, (that <hi>Peſtilent Northern Hereſy</hi>) our Liberties and our Properties, and was upon the point of effecting that Tremendous Deſign; but God in his Wiſe Providence, with Infinite Mercy and Compaſſion to this almoſt Ruined Land and People, ſaw it meet to give <hi>check</hi> to that <hi>Imperial</hi> Carreer, with a <hi>hitherto ſhalt thou come, and no further.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HE REMOVETH KINGS, AND SETTETH UP KINGS.</p>
            <p>In this Volume, you have a full Account of our late happy Revolution, with almoſt all the ſteps and meaſures that were taken in it, and a juſtification of our preſent Settlement. 'Twas God's doing and it ought ever to be marvellous in our eyes.</p>
            <p>We have now a King and Queen profeſſing the ſame Faith with our ſelves; who, as He came over to preſerve our Deareſt Intereſts, the Proteſtant Religion, and to reſtore to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s our <hi>invaded</hi> Laws and Liberties, found the Nation generally diſpoſed to receive him, as the Mighty Deliverer, under God, of this Church and State. The hand of Heaven conducted him with ſafety up to <hi>London,</hi> and all the Kingdom called him <hi>Bleſſed;</hi> and in a ſence of Joy and Gratitude to Him and His Royal Conſort, The <hi>whole Body</hi> of the Nation by their <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> in Parliament, have <hi>recognized</hi> and <hi>acknowledged</hi> Their preſent Majeſties to be their <hi>Lawful</hi> and <hi>Rightful</hi> Sovereign Liege Lord and Lady. And how could we do leſs than own them for our King and Queen, who by ſuch an ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing turn, have redeemed from Slavery both our Souls and Bodies, if we pretend to any value for our Holy Religion, or any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Love of Liberty?</p>
            <p>We have a King of an Extraordinary Perſonal Valour and Conduct, that hath very often already ventured his Life, and ſtill reſolves to deſpiſe all difficulties and hazards himſelf, that His People may reap the fruit of them in their own Peace and Proſperity, and that the Proteſtant Religion may be eſtabliſhed to us and our Children to future Generations.</p>

            <head>THE <hi>Earl of Clarendon's Speech,</hi> ABOUT Disbanding the Army. <hi>SEPTEMBER</hi> 13. 1660.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lords and Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE King tells you that he hath commanded me to ſay many particulars to you, and the truth is, He hath charged me, with ſo many, that I have great reaſon to fear, that I ſhall ſtand in much need of His Mercy, for omitting many things He hath given me in Command, at leaſt for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering them in more Diſorder and Confuſion, then Matters of ſuch Moment and Importance ought to be to ſuch an Aſſembly, for which the King Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath even a kind of Reverence, as well as an extraordinary Kindneſs. I am to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſome things He hath done already, and many things He intends to do during this Receſs, that you may ſee, how well content ſoever he is, that you ſhould have Eaſe, and Pleaſure, and Refreſhment, he hath deſigned Work enough for Himſelf.</p>
            <p>The King hath thanked you for the Proviſion you have made that there may be no free Quarter during the time the Army ſhall be Disbanding, and hath told you what He will do with that Money you have given Him, if there ſhould want wherewithal to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band it; And now I hope you will all believe, that His Majeſty will conſent to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding: He will do ſo; And yet He does not take it unkindly at their hands, who have thought that his Majeſty would not Disband this Army; It was a ſober and a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Jealouſie; No other Prince in <hi>Europe</hi> would be willing to Disband ſuch an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; an Army to which Victory is entailed, and which, humanely ſpeaking, could hardly fail of Conqueſt whitherſoever He ſhould lead it; and if God had not reſtored His Majeſty to that rare Felicity, as to be without apprehenſion of Danger at home or from abroad, and without any Ambition of taking from his Neighbours what they are poſſeſſed of; Himſelf would never Disband this Army; an Army whoſe Order and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline, whoſe Sobriety and Manners, whoſe Courage and Succeſs hath made it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and terrible over the World; an Army of which the King and His two Royal Brothers may ſay, as the noble <hi>Grecian</hi> ſaid of <hi>Aeneas,</hi>

            <p>They have all three in ſeveral Countries found themſelves engaged in the midſt of theſe Troops, in the heat and rage of Battel, and if any common Souldiers (as no doubt many may) will demand the old <hi>Roman</hi> Priviledge for having encountred Princes ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, upon my Conſcience, he will find both Favour and Perferment: They have all three obſerved the Diſcipline, and felt, and admired, and loved the Courage of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, when they were the worſe for it; and I have ſeen them in a ſeaſon when there was little elſe of comfort in their view, refreſh themſelves with joy, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had done the great Work, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had got the Day, and then pleaſe themſelves with the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination what wonders they ſhould perform in the head of ſuch an Army: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when His Majeſty is ſo entirely poſſeſſed of the Affection and obedience of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and when it hath merited ſo much from Him, can it be believed, or imagined, that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48501:6"/>He can without ſome regret part with them? No: <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> He will never part with them, and the only ſure way never to part with them, is to Disband them; ſhould it be otherwiſe, they muſt be expoſed to the daily Importunity of His great Neighbours and Allies; and how could He refuſe to lend them His Troops, of which He hath no uſe Himſelf? His Majeſty knows they are too good <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, to wiſh that a ſtanding Army ſhould be kept in the howels of their own Countrey; that they who did but in <hi>Bello pacis gerere negotium,</hi> and who, whileſt an Army lived like good Husbandmen in the Countrey, and good Citizens in the City, will now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come really ſuch, and take Delight in the Benefit of that Peace they have ſo honeſtly and ſo wonderfully brought to paſs: The King will part with them, as the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Parents part with their Children for their Education, and for their Perferment; He will prefer them to Disbanding, and prefer them by Disbanding, and will always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch a Kindneſs for them, and ſuch a Memory of the Service they have done him, that both Officers and Souldiers, after they are Disbanded, ſhall always find ſuch coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, favour, and reward from His Majeſty, that He doubts not, but if he ſhould have Occaſion to uſe their Service, they will again reſort to Him with the ſame Alacrity, as if they had never been Disbanded: And if there be any ſo ill amongſt them (as there can be but very few, if any) who will forfeit that Favour and Protection they may have from Him, by any withſtanding His Majeſties Commands, and the full and declared ſenſe of the Kingdom; His Majeſty is confident they will be as odious to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, as they can be to any other honeſt Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> I am in the next place, by the Kings Command, to put you in mind of the Act of Indemnity, not of any Grants or Conceſſions, or Releaſes He made to you in that Act, I have nothing of that in charge; no Prince hath ſo excellent a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory to forget the Favours he doth; but of what He hath done againſt you in that Act, how you may be undone by that Act, if you are not very careful to perform the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations He hath laid upon you in it: the clauſe I am to put you in mind of, is this, <hi>And to the intent and purpoſe that all names and terms of Diſtinction may be likewiſe put into utter Oblivion, Be it further Enacted by the Authority aforeſaid, That if any Perſon or Perſons, within the ſpace of three Years next enſuing, ſhall preſume ſo maliciouſly to call or alledge, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt any other Perſon or Perſons any Name or Names, or other words of Reproach, any way leading to revive the Memory of the late Differences, or the occaſion thereof, That then every ſuch Perſon, ſo as aforeſaid offending, ſhall forfeit, &amp;c.</hi> It is no matter for the Penalty, it is too cheap a one; the King wiſhes it had been greater, and therefore hath by His juſt Prerogative (and 'tis well for us He hath ſuch a Prerogative) added another Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty more inſupportable, even His high Diſpleaſure againſt all who ſhall ſwerve from this Clauſe in the Act. Give me leave to tell you, that as many Name or Names, or other words of Reproach are expreſly againſt the Letter, and puniſhable accordingly, ſo evil and envious looks, murmuring and diſcontented hearts, are as directly againſt the Equity of this Statute, a direct breach of the Act of Indempnity, and ought to be be puniſhed too; And I believe they may be ſo. You know Kings are in ſome ſenſe called Gods, and ſo they may in ſome degree be able to look into mens hearts; and God hath given us a King who can look as far into mens hearts as any Prince alive; and he hath great skill in Phyſiognomy too, you would wonder what Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions He hath made from thence; and no doubt, if He be provoked by evil looks, to make a further Enquiry into mens hearts, and finds thoſe corrupted with the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Envy and Uncharitableneſs, He will never chooſe thoſe hearts to truſt and rely upon. He hath given us a Noble and Princely Example, by opening and ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing His Arms to all who are worthy to be His Subjects, worthy to be thought Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen, by extending His heart with a pious and grateful joy to find all His Subjects at once in His Arms, and Himſelf in theirs: and ſhall we fold our arms towards one another, and contract our hearts with Envy and Malice to each other, by any ſharp memory of what hath been unneighbourly or unkindly done heretofore? What is this but to rebell againſt the Perſon of the King, againſt the excellent Example and Vertue of the King, againſt the known Law of the Land, this bleſſed Act of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> The King is a Suitor to you, makes it His Suit very heartily, That you will joyn with Him in reſtoring the whole Nation to its primitive Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Integrity, to its old good Manners, its old good Humour, and its old good Nature; Good Nature, a Vertue ſo peculiar to you, ſo appropriated by God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to this Nation, that it can be tranſlated into no other Language, hardly practiſed by any other People, and that you will by your Example, by the Candor of your Converſation, by your Precepts, and by your Practiſe, and by all your Intereſt,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48501:6"/>teach your Neighbours and your Friends, how to pay a full Obedience to this Clauſe of the Statute, how to learn this excellent Art of Forgetfulneſs.</p>
            <p>Let them remember, and let us remember, how ungracious, how undecent, how ugly the Inſolence, the Fierceneſs, the Bruitiſhneſs of their Enemies appeared to them; and we may piouſly and reaſonably believe, that Gods Indignation againſt them, for their want of Bowels, for their not being <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> (for they had the hearts of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans and Infidels (ſent a Whirlwind in a moment to blow them out of the World, that is, out of a capacity to do more miſchief in the World, except we practiſe their Vices, and do that our ſelves which we pretend to deteſt them for: Let us not be too much aſhamed, as if what hath been done amiſs, proceeded from the humour and the temper, and the nature of our Nation. The <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> have made us a fair excuſe, and truly I hope a true one; all the motions of theſe laſt twenty Years have been unnatural, and have proceeded from the evil Influence of a malignant Star; and let us not too much deſpiſe the Influence of the Stars: And the ſame <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> aſſure us, that the Malignity of that Star is expired; the good <hi>Genius</hi> of this Kingdom is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Superiour, and hath maſtered that Malignity, and our own good old Stars go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern us again, and their Influence is ſo ſtrong, that with our help, they will repair in a Year, what hath been decaying in twenty; and they only ſhall have no excuſe from the Star, who continue their Malignity and own all the ill that is paſt to be their own, by continuing and improving it for the time to come.</p>
            <p>If any body here, or any where elſe, be too much exalted with what he hath done, or what he hath ſuffered, and from thence thinks himſelf waranted to reproach others, let him remember the ſtory of <hi>Nicephorus;</hi> it is an excellent ſtory and very applicable to ſuch Diſtempers: He was a pious and a religious man, and for his Piety and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was condemned to the fire; when he was led to Execution, and when an old Friend who had done him injury enough, fell at his feet and asked him Pardon; the poor Man was ſo elevated with the Triumph he was going unto, with the Glory of Martyrdom, that he refuſed to be reconciled unto him; upon which he was diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed of his end; and for this Uncharitableneſs, the Spirit of God immediately for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook him, and he apoſtatized from the Faith. Let all thoſe who are too proud of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been as they think leſs faulty then other Men, and ſo are unwilling to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to thoſe who have offended them, take heed of the Apoſtacy of <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> and that thoſe fumes of Envy and Uncharitableneſs, and Murmuring, do not ſo far tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and intoxicate them, that they fall into thoſe very Crimes, they value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for having hitherto declined.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> whileſt we conſpire together, to execute faithfully this part of the Bill, to put all old Names and Terms of Diſtinction into utter Oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; let us not find new Names and Terms to keep up the ſame, or a worſe Disſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: If the old Reproaches of Cavalier, and Round-head, and Malignant, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Grave; let us not find more ſignificant and better words, to ſignifie worſe things; let not Piety and Godlineſs grow into terms of Reproach, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between the Court, and the City, and the Countrey; and let not Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Godlineſs be meaſured by a moroſity in Manners, an affectation of Geſture, a new mode and tone of Speaking; at leaſt, let not our Conſtitutions and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions make us be thought of a contrary Party; and becauſe we have not an affected auſterity in our looks, that we have not Piety in our hearts. Very merry Men have been very godly Men; and if a good <hi>Conſcience</hi> be a continual <hi>Feaſt,</hi> there is no reaſon but Men may be merry at it.</p>
            <p>You, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> have this Day made a noble Preſent to the King. Do you think if you and your worthy Companions had brought it up with folded Arms, down-caſt Looks, with Sighs and other Inſtances of Deſperation, it would not have been a very melancholy Preſent? Have not you frank and dutiful Expreſſions, that cheerfulneſs and vivacity in your Looks, rendred much more acceptable, much more valuable? No Prince in Chriſtendom loves a cheerful giver ſo well as <hi>God Almighty</hi> does, and he of all Gifts, a cheerful Heart; and therefore I pray let not a cloudy and diſconſolate face be the only, or the beſt ſign of Piety and Devotion in the Heart.</p>
            <p>I muſt ask your Pardon for miſplacing much of this Diſcourſe, which I ſhould have mentioned, when I came to ſpeak of the Miniſters Bill; they I hope will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to remove theſe new marks of Dinſtinction and Reproaches, and keep their Auditories from being impoſed upon by ſuch Characters and Deſcriptions. The King hath paſſed this <hi>Act</hi> very willingly, and done much to the end of this <hi>Act</hi> before; yet hath willingly admitted you to be Sharers and Partners with Him
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48501:7"/>in the Obligation: I may ſay confidently His Majeſty hath never denied His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation to any Man in Poſſeſſion who hath asked it; and they have all the effect of it, except ſuch who upon Examination and Enquiry, appeared not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it, and ſuch who though they are pardoned, cannot yet think themſelves worthy to be preferr'd. His Majeſty well knows that by this <hi>Act</hi> he hath grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and obliged many worthy and pious Men, who have contributed much to His Reſtauration, and who ſhall always receive freſh Evidence of His Majeſties Favour and Kindneſs, but he is not ſure that he may not likewiſe have grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſome who did neither contribute to His coming in, nor are yet glad that he is in; how comes it elſe to paſs, that he receives ſuch frequent informations of Seditious Sermons in the City and the Countrey, in which all Induſtry is uſed to alienate the Affections of the People, and to infuſe Jealouſies into them of the King and His Government; They talk of introducing Popery, of evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, and ſuch other old Calumnies as are pardoned by this Act of Indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pnity.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty told You when he was laſt here, what Rigour and Severity He will hereafter uſe, how contrary ſoever it is to his Nature in theſe Caſes; and conjured You, <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> to concur with him in this juſt and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Severity, which I am ſure You will do with Your utmoſt Vigilance, and that You will believe that too much ill cannot befall thoſe who do the beſt they can to corrupt His Majeſties Nature, and to extinguiſh His Mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> I told You I was to acquaint you with ſome things His Majeſty intends to do during this Receſs, that You may ſee He will give no intermiſſion to His Own thoughts for the Publick good, though for a time He Diſpences with Your Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>He doth conſider the infinite Importance the Improvement of Trade muſt be to this Kingdom, and therefore His Majeſty intends forthwith to Eſtabliſh a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil for Trade, conſiſting of ſome Principal Merchants of the ſeveral Companies; to which he will add ſome Gentlemen of Quality and Experience; and for their greater Honour and Encouragement, ſome of my Lords of His own Privy Council.</p>
            <p>In the next Place, His Majeſty hopes that a well-ſetled Peace, and Gods great Bleſſing upon Him and You, this Nation will in a ſhort time flouriſh to that Degree, that the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> did, when <hi>Eſau</hi> found it neceſſary to part from his Brother. — <hi>For their riches were more, then that they might dwell together, and the land wherein they were could not bear them, becauſe of their cattel:</hi> We have been Our ſelves very near this Pinacle of happineſs, and the hope and Contemplation that We may be ſo again, diſpoſes the King to be very ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous for the Improvement and Proſperity of His Plantations abroad, where there is ſuch large room for the Induſtry and Reception of ſuch who ſhall deſire to go thither; and therefore His Majeſty likewiſe intends to erect and eſtabliſh a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel for thoſe Plantations, in which perſons well qualified ſhall be wholly intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the good and advancement of thoſe Plantations.</p>
            <p>There are two other particulars, which I am commanded to mention, which were both mentioned and recommended to You by His Majeſty in his Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>Breda;</hi> The one, for the Confirmation of Sales, or other Recompence for Purchaſers; The other, for the compoſing thoſe Differences and Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in Religion, which have too much diſturbed the Peace of the Kingdom. Two very weighty particulars, in which His Majeſty knows You have ſpent much time, and concerning which, he ſhould have heard from You before this time, if You had not met with great difficulties in the Diſquiſition of either.</p>
            <p>For the Firſt, His Majeſty hath not been without much thought upon the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and hath done much towards the Accommodation of many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons, and You ſhall not be at Your Journeys end, before His Majeſty will put that Buſineſs concerning Sales into ſuch a way of Diſpatch, that he doubts not You will find a good Progreſs made in it before Your coming together again, and I believe the Perſons concerned, will be very much to blame, if they receive not good Satisfaction; And ſome of You who ſtay in Town, ſhall be adviſed and conſulted with that Setlement.</p>
            <p>The other, of Religion, is a ſad Argument indeed; It is a Conſideration that muſt make every religious heart to bleed, to ſee Religion, which ſhould be the ſtrongeſt obligation and cement of Affection, and brotherly kindneſs and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made now by the Wranglings of paſſionate and froward Men, the ground of all
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48501:7"/>animoſity, hatred, malice and revenge: And this unruly and unmanly Paſſion (which no queſtion the Divine Nature exceedingly abhors) ſometimes and I fear too frequently tranſports thoſe who are in the right, as well thoſe who are in the wrong, and leaves the latter more excuſable then the former, when men who find their manners and diſpoſitions very conformable in all the neceſſary obligations of humane Nature, avoid one anothers Converſation, and grow firſt unſociable, and then uncharitable to each other, becauſe one cannot think as the other doth: And from this ſeparation we intitle God to the Patronage of, and Concernment in our Fancies and Diſtinction, and purely for his ſake hate one another heartily. It was not ſo of old, when one of the moſt ancient Fathers of the Church tells us, That Love and Charity was ſo ſignal and eminent in the Primitive Chriſtians, that it even drew Admiration and Envy from their Adverſaries, <hi>Vide inquiunt ut invicim ſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligunt!</hi> Their Adverſaries in that in which they moſt agreed, in their very proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them, had their Paſſions and Animoſities amongſt themſelves; they were only Chriſtians, that loved, and cheriſhed, and comforted, and were ready to die for one another: <hi>Quid nunc illi dicerent Chriſtiani, ſi noſtra viderent tempora,</hi> ſays the incomparable <hi>Grotius:</hi> How would they look upon our ſharp and virulent Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Debates of <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and the bloudy wars that have proceeded from thoſe Contentions, whileſt every one pretended to all the Marks which are to attend upon the true Church, except only that which is inſeparable from it, <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> This Diſquiſition hath coſt the King many a Sigh, many a ſad Hour, when he hath conſidered the almoſt irreparable Reproach the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> hath undergone, from the Diviſions and Diſtractions which have been ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious within this Kingdom. What pains he hath taken to compoſe them, after ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Diſcourſes with learned and pious Men of different Perſwaſions, you will ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee, by a <hi>Declaration</hi> He will publiſh upon that Occaſion, by which you will ſee His great Indulgence to thoſe who can have any Protection from <hi>Conſcience</hi> to differ with their Brethren. And I hope God will ſo bleſs the Candor of His Majeſty in the Condeſcentions he makes, that the Church as well as the State, will return to that Unity and Unanimity, which will make both King and People as happy as they can hope to be in this World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> I ſhall conclude with the Kings hearty thanks to you, not only for what you have done towards Him, which hath been very ſignal, but for what you have done towards each other; for the excellent correſpondence you have maintained; for the very ſeaſonable Deference and Condeſcention you have had for each other, which will reſtore <hi>Parliaments</hi> to the Veneration they ought to have. And ſince His Majeſty knows, that you all deſire to pleaſe him, you have given him ample Evidence, that you do ſo; He hath appointed me to give you a ſure Receipt to attain that good End, it is a Receipt of His own preſcribing, and therefore is not like to fail:</p>
            <p>Be but pleaſed your ſelves, and perſwade others to be ſo; contrive all the ways imaginable for your own Happineſs, and you will make Him the beſt pleaſed, and the moſt happy Prince in the World.</p>

               <p>THIS Diſcourſe being imaginarily Scened, and yet really performed out of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a very great Miniſter of State's Capacity; it was thought fit to be Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed now, and not before, becauſe that Reſpect ought to be payed to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Affairs, ſo as nothing ſhould anticipate the <hi>King</hi>'s own Labours, to give the People Satisfaction in his due time touching the tender Care that He is graciouſly pleaſed to take of all his Subjects in point of Honour, Safety, Freedom, Union, and Commerce: which nothing could more advance then the Concluſion of the <hi>Treaty</hi> newly made betwixt <hi>England</hi> and the States of the <hi>United Provinces;</hi> which without Flattery may be demonſtrated to Men of Underſtanding to aim at nothing but the Good of His Subjects in general, exempt from all manner of private Intereſt what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.

               <head>THE State of England, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>THE Adventure which happened unto me lately is of ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary a nature, and contains ſo many important Diſcoveries in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the publick Good in its Progreſs, that I ſhould prove de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective towards my Countrey, if I did not candidly publiſh all the Paſſages, both touching the Occaſion, and Effects of what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from this Accident:</p>
               <p>Know then that a Peer of the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and one whoſe Merit, Quality, and the Place which he holds in the Adminiſtration of the Affairs of the Kingdom are remarkable; did invite ſundry of his Lordſhip's beſt Friends to a magnificent Feaſt, and amongſt the reſt he had the kindneſs not to omit me out of the number: where the excellence of the Chear which he made to his Gueſts, after a moſt noble manner put the whole Company into ſuch a refined humour of converſing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that the Entertainment was but one intire pleaſing Debate, how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our compleat enjoying of each other. I was not wanting with the uttermoſt of Vigour and Solace to uphold the Genious of this Conference. But as the freeſt ſpeakers do commonly come by the worſt in Diſcourſe, and are the ſooneſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to enterfiering laſhes; I found my ſelf to be attacqued in ſo many places at once with the ſwiftneſs of other Mens Reaſons and Wits, who held the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Arguments, that although I were ſomething heated, yet there remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me preſence of mind enough (and ſucceſs of Intervalls) to get inſenſibly out of the Preſs, whilſt the Diſorder and Confuſion laſted, (which is uſual at ſuch Meetings) into another room. I retired then purſuing the Opportunity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a fair Gallery, which ſurpriſed my Eyes with the rich Ornaments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it was furniſhed; but not without trouble neither, and a Curioſity beyond the Opticks of the Place, which increaſed there; ſo as I was diverted from any farther Conſideration of the Furniture, becauſe the Place ſeemed to lie too near the Enemy, to dwell any longer upon thoſe Objects. Wherefore I went into another Chamber hard by, which inſtantly filled me with new Apprehenſions, by the means of ſeveral large Looking-Glaſſes hanging on the Walls; which ſhewed me my own proper Figure at length on every ſide, and from thence imprinted in my wounded Imagination as many Adverſaries as there were angular Reflections out of each Mirrour; that appeared to purſue me ſo furiouſly, that I ran on violently with my head forwards, in order to ſome Eſcape, to the door of another Chamber ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning thereunto, which opened with ſuch Reſiſtance, when I thruſt againſt it, as if it had been forced with a Petard: And thus falling in the Attempt, I was ſo ſtunned, that it was a good while after before I could come to my ſelf again. But at laſt having partly recovered my ſpirits, I was ſurpriſed with a freſh aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as much amazed me, as the former had done that I repeated: for when I began to open my eyes half way, finding that till then they had been altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſeful to me, I attributed the Diſorder to want of Sight, often feeling, in regard of the Darkneſs of the Room, to try whether they were ſtill in my head or not. Yet perceiving, betwixt Diſcerning and Doubting, that all I aſſayed of this kind was to no purpoſe; after having deplored the bitterneſs of an imaginary Loſs, I groped on more and more in the dark until I chanced to come to an <hi>Alcone,</hi> where feeling with my hands I took faſt hold upon the <hi>Alcone,</hi> and graſped the Pillar of a Bed, which had I not light upon, I muſt have fallen the ſecond time. For, thruſting hard againſt one of the Poſts, the Counter-ſtroak of the Wood threw me all along into the middle of a Couch, where I remained ſtretched forth like a Coarſe without any motion, in the ſame poſture of a precipitate Swoon. And then it was that the Vapours of my Body, which were diſturbed by the firſt Miſtake, confuſedly did ſtir through all the parts in the agitated fluctuancy of a Storm; though by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees growing to be undeceived, Sleep, which appeaſeth all the Mutinies in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Creatures, did naturally and more agreeably ſeiſe upon my Faculties, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48501:9"/>the Tempeſt with perfect tranquility of Mind and animal Operations, as if I had never been ſo diſcompoſed. 'Tis impoſſible to tell you how long I continued in the State of this <hi>Interregnum</hi> betwixt Life and Death, nor what Care the Company took to learn what was become of me, but in vain; blaming me for having left them, or rather the War begun, uſing all ſorts of means to find where I was, and bring me back to the Combate.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only tell you by the way, that about Sun-ſet a great Noiſe was raiſed by two of the ſervants of the Houſe, who entred ſuddenly into the Chamber where I lay; which aſſured me as I awakened that I was yet living; and the blazing of the Wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tapers, which they ſet upon the Tables and Cup-boards, made me extremely joyful at the Reſtauration of my ſight, which in my Opinion till then was abſolutely gone from me. But then a third Apprehenſion ſeiſed on my Powers, firſt, to be catch in ſuch a Poſture, and expoſed to the innocent jeſts which might be made by the Gueſts on the ſubject of my ſtrange Diſorder, and precipated Flight from them. But as I ſought my Eyes once more, to ſteal away out of this Society for all Night, and not be ſeen by any Body, another noiſe obliged me to keep cloſe where I was upon the Bed, and draw the Curtains home, not to be diſcovered. I was not long in this Concealment, when I ſaw come into the ſame Place three Perſons, whoſe Deſerts in this Relation muſt be better known than their Names, and the Importance of their Intereſt in the State, by what I am going now to ſay of thoſe particulars, becauſe I am ſtrictly obliged not to reveal them. Theſe ſtrangers the Maſter of the Houſe did very civilly introduce into the Chamber, who without many Complements ſate down on the ſeats which were prepared for them near the Table. My Sleep had digeſted thoſe Fumes, and diſſipated all the Clouds of my Underſtanding: therefore judging that the cauſe that aſſembled ſuch great Perſonages together there in this ſecret Entertainment could not be but of the higheſt importance; both the Curioſity, and the Shame of having them witneſſes to my Diſorder, obliged me to keep firm to my Poſt, within the cover of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed, and to lend an attentive ear to all their Diſcourſe. For the Maſter of the houſe began the Overture of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the Terms following.</p>
               <p>In that part which we do hold of the Government of the State, it is not enough that a ſincere Amity doth link us in one band of Intereſt and Eſteem particularly to each other, if we be not alſo united in the ſame Judgment as to all which concerns the Publick Good. In our former Conferences we uſed to take juſt Meaſures how to rectifie things within the <hi>Realm;</hi> but now it reſts with us to agree upon ſome Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims which are to be maintained in regard of <hi>Foreign Matters,</hi> to the end that in theſe Rencounters, wherein we are to give Counſel, we may act in all things with a perfect Concert, which no doubt will give a great weight to the Reſolutions which ſhall be formed thereupon, and the preſent Caſe; ſince never have any Counſellours treated of nicer Points, nor more ſerious ones than thoſe which are to be debated among us to day. The fire is already kindled in our Neighbourhood; the Monarchy of <hi>Spain</hi> is juſt upon the brink of falling to the ground, if it be not ſuccoured; and <hi>France</hi> in a conditition to avow the vaſt Deſign which that Crown hath long meditated, as well againſt the Peace of <hi>Europe,</hi> as the Commerce of our Navigations, if a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fence be not quickly made, to keep the <hi>French</hi> within their Bounds. Wherefore all the reſt of the Forces of <hi>Europe</hi> ſtand at gaze, expecting the Reſult of what <hi>England</hi> doth determine herein, conſidering us the Counter-ballance, which time out of mind hath held the Scales even betwixt thoſe two great Monarchies, for the Safety of all the reſt. They wait but our giving of the Sign, to joyn with us in the common Defence: and the better ſhare of them ſeek it from <hi>England;</hi> and the others have their Eyes open towards our Conduct, to take their meaſures alſo by no other model but what we ſhall trace out unto them.</p>
               <p>There is no need of a Providence extraordinary enlightned, to judge which is our true Intereſt in this Conjuncture; but the preſent State of our Affairs doth not leave us the ſame Facilities to follow it, in which we do abound as to the Knowledge thereof.</p>
               <p>Mean while the Miſchief preſſes forwards, and doth not afford Place nor Time ſufficient to expect a Benefit of other Viciſſitudes, which run ſufficiently againſt us; nor to regulate our Reſolutions by thoſe Events, which take too impetuous a part in the Cauſe on that ſide which we ought moſt to fear. Therefore it is more than ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to form our Fundamental Maxim, on which all our Conduct is to move in this preſent Conjuncture; and at this very inſtant decide, whether we will chuſe to be ſimple Spectators, or take ſome part to act in this Tragedy; ſince the Reſolution
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48501:9"/>which we ſhall fix thereupon will be the Center, from whence we muſt draw all our Lines afterwards. Which is the proper Point that we are to diſcourſe of now among our ſelves here, before we do give our Opinions on the whole matter to the Publick; and in which particular I deſire the rather to be enlightned by your wiſe Reaſonings by how much the more I am aſſured, That the ſole good of the State is the only Rule and Object of all your Counſels.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as ever he had uttered theſe words, one of the Three, after caſting down of his Eyes, and pondering what he was to ſay to the reſt, with having thought before he adviſed, began his Diſcourſe thus:</p>
               <p>If late Experience had not taught us enough to our coſt, that it is much eaſier to begin a War, than ſucceſsfully to get out of it when once it is commenced, I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large my ſelf on that Subject to repreſent unto you piece by piece, the Dangers, Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, and Loſſes which ſuch a Reſolution uſually doth carry along with it; where frequently the Conquerer finds he is more charged with Debts than with Trophies, and the People always have cauſe to mingle their Acclamations with Tears, in the courſe of ſuch expenſive Triumphs; ſince before any Edifice is begun, the Dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons how to ſettle a ſolid Foundation to undertake the War upon, ſhould previouſly be conſidered, by meaſuring our Means and Forces as well as thoſe of the Enemy with whom we are to fight; and the like touching their Power, whoſe Intereſt we intend to embrace.</p>
               <p>Our Forces and Means you all know are already exhauſted with long and ſharp Wars, both at home and abroad; and by the Hand of God, which hath been hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy upon us in the late <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> and in the <hi>Firing</hi> of the City of <hi>London:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis but now that we begin by the means of Peace to breathe again; which Peace alſo is not firmly eſtabliſhed. Time then is requiſite for us to take breath and recover in, after ſo terrible an Agitation: nor can any thing be ſo dangerous unto this State as a Relapſe in the midſt of Amendment. If the noiſe of our Neighbours doth awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken us, our Wearineſs likewiſe invites us to ſeek ſome Repoſe: and in caſe there be danger to ſuffer the Growth of a ſuſpected Power, there will not be leſs peril in the checking of that Power unprepared. You know, as well or better than I can tell you, the Condition of the Revenue, and the exceſſive Expenſe of this Realm, which ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably muſt carry the War from home, unleſs we mean ſupinely to be deſtroyed: and therefore of neceſſity muſt our Wings be ſuffered to grow again after this clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, before that we do offer to make a new Flight. You cannot be ignorant too, that Commerce is the Soul and the Life of this Kingdom, which is the Channel from whence the Abundance of it flows: And the Wealth which we formerly enjoyed, and rendred us ſo conſiderable in the World, beſides the freſh Experiment of the Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Interruption which the War brought into all the Traffick of the Land, hath made us clearly ſee, that for Merchant-mens Fleets to be changed into Naval Armies, and the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the People melted into <hi>Magazins</hi> unuſefully which might more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably be imployed in rich and gainful <hi>Navigations,</hi> cannot be the proper Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we conſider the preſent State of <hi>France,</hi> we ſhall find that all the reſt of <hi>Europe</hi> bow under that Power; and thoſe who are the moſt concerned to ſuccour <hi>Spain,</hi> bleed at the Noſe only, without being able to break the Impoſtume within. The Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences of <hi>France</hi> and their Practices make their way every where, either with Bribes or by Addreſs; Victory waites ſtill on all their Motions, and by having redreſſed the Abuſes of their Exchequer, they have laid an unexhauſtible Foundation of Money within themſelves. Over and above that, the <hi>French</hi> are a Nation, or rather a Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary of Nobility and Souldiers, ſo verſed in the Trade of War, as this Proviſion puts them in a Poſture never to be ſavingly juſtled.</p>
               <p>I grant, their Deſigns are Vaſt, and their Pretentions ill grounded; but how can we take Cognizance of that? are we Knights-errant, to expoſe our Lives in the reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of other mens Quarrels; the large Interpoſition of Sea, which divides us from the reſt of the World, may ſhelter us enough from their Attempts, without founding of our ſafety upon the Conſervation of our Neighbours.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe we had ſuch an abundance of Charity to ſpare, as to hazzard our own ſafety in favour of another's; we ſhould at leaſt be ſecured before hand, that when we are at a ſecond Charge of ſuccouring them, it might prove profitable unto them, otherwiſe the Miſchief being grown to that point of Extremity where now it reſts, all inſignificant Remedies of this Nature would but anger them the more to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And <hi>Spain</hi> being deeply engaged in the War of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which is alone able to give the <hi>Spaniards</hi> work enough, as the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Councels ſtand divided, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſlowneſs of their Operations, their Treaſure being likewiſe exhauſted, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48501:10"/>the principal Places of <hi>Flanders</hi> in the Hands of the <hi>French,</hi> and thoſe which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unconquered hardly in a Condition to make any Reſiſtance when they ſhall be attackqued, which diſpoſes that Crown to ſeek a Peace with <hi>France</hi> on any Terms; and the Propoſitions in order to a League Offenſive and Defenſive with them, which they make to us, being tendred only to <hi>England</hi> as a wily Lure to oblige the <hi>French</hi> to conclude it the ſooner, out of an Apprehenſion that we may reſolve to aſſiſt <hi>Spain;</hi> why ſhould we raſhly, I pray, thruſt our Sickle into this blighted Corn?</p>
               <p>Indeed, when Inconveniences are viſible on all ſides of the Proſpect of ſuch Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the wiſeſt Counſel ſure is to ſuſpend the Reſoultion a while. For on which part can we place our Intereſt thus, without incurring blame juſtly? The Party of <hi>Spain</hi> is weak and unlucky; that of <hi>France</hi> is unjuſt, and contrary to our Good: ſhall we then ſacrifice our ſelves for <hi>Spain,</hi> which for three Years together hath ſtood idle, with their arms folded a croſs, without ſo much as proffering to help us, whileſt three of the greateſt Powers of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> let one another Bloud, and thus were only paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in our Ruine? Muſt we then joyn with <hi>France,</hi> which were ſo lately combined with our Enemies to deſtroy us, and that tore the Victory out of our hands when we had it ſure? Shall we contribute the Liquor of our Veins to facilitate their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, which ought to be ſo redoubted by this Nation, and ſo become inſtrumental towards the erecting a <hi>Coloſſus</hi> which muſt certainly tread us under foot with the Weight of it? All theſe conſiderations, which I ſubmit to your Prudence, oblige me to conclude, that there being no part to be taken in this War which is not deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive; the beſt will be to take no Part, but ſit ſtill, and obſerve how the Game is play'd, and in the mean time to provide for the repairing of our Revenues, and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eting of Diſorders at home, by conciliating and re-uniting the minds of the People, the re-eſtabliſhment of Commerce, and to put our ſelves into ſuch a Condition, that the Conquerour may not be able to make a wrong uſe of his Victory to our Prejudice. And in the mean time, not to remain altogether idle in the common Danger of <hi>Europe,</hi> we may contribute our endeavours to obtain a Peace, and by a happy Accommodation ſtop the courſe of theſe Conqueſts, which gives us ſuch juſt Jealouſie.</p>
               <p>He had ſcarce made an end of ſpeaking, when a little murmure aroſe among the reſt of the Conferrers, which made me conceive that they did no ways ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of what he did urge. Wherein I found that I was not deceived neither; becauſe he which ſat right over againſt him, anſwered him preſently after this manner.</p>
               <p>If Peace were a Benefit which always did depend upon our own Choice, and if War were not, ordinarily ſpeaking, a Miſchief as neceſſary as the other is; the Queſtion which we do treat of now might eaſily be reſolved, and would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any longer Deliberation. But it is not enough to conſerve Peace, to have a pacifick Spirit, if our Neighbours likewiſe be not of the ſame Diſpoſition towards it; which in effect is to reckon, without the Hoſt, by founding the hopes of our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Quiet, barely on the Promiſes of our own Moderation; ſince thoſe which are the moſt in love with Peace, are oftentimes involved in the oppoſite Agitation, whether they will or no, by ſome violent motion of Fortune; and ſo frequently ſtumble upon War in the Flight which they make from it, and thus ſuffocates the Peace by too much avoiding the War.</p>
               <p>I do avow that the Reaſons which were alledged before could not be anſwered, if he who did ſo well deduce them, were able to aſſure us upon good Grounds, that in keeping our ſelves Neuters in this War of the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> we might be ſheltered from the Storm of another War, both in the preſent and future Tenſe of ſuch Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes; or peaceably and long enjoy ſo happy a Tranquility, which makes him believe that we ought to deſpiſe, for that Speculation, all manner of uſeful Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which Fortune doth daily offer unto us. But in truth, my Lord, would you venture to be caution thereupon to the State, and pawn your Faith to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and your Honour concerning the Event? For my own part, I hold you too wiſe and too quick-ſighted, to imagine meerly on the Preſumption of unſolid Hopes, that there can be the leaſt ſhadow or colour of Safety remaining for us, if one of theſe two Monarchies which are at this time Engaged in a War, ſhould fall under the abſolute Power of the other, or if they do re-unite again by an Agreement, in which poſſibly, as we have handled the matter, we may very well not be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. In caſe you'll avow this Truth, which all the World knows to be ſo, it follows that you muſt grant, that all thoſe inconveniences which were already alledged to keep us out of all kinds of Engagement are not longer valid, when there is a indiſpenſable neceſſity and the Welfare and the Safety of the State are at Stake.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:48501:10"/>
               <p>I ſhall not enlarge my ſelf hereon, to repreſent unto you that our Predeceſſors e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver held this to be a fundamental Maxime of their Conduct, to hold the Balance e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual between theſe two Great Monarchies, and that on which ſide ſoever they turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Scales, Victory did uſually follow that Counterpoiſe, which never failed to put things into that juſt Temperament that preſerves the Health of this Realm. By which means in ſome ſort they made themſelves the Arbitrators of Chriſtendom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by affording their Help unto one of the two Parties, they became in effect Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters over them both, by ſtill keeping one of them at their Devotion, and in our Dependency, through the proſpect of thoſe Succours which they do continually need from hence; and the other, with the apprehenſion of this Aſſiſtance. For thus the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> what with the force of their Arms, and the power of Arbitrating in Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, have always been the Law-givers to the Succeſs both of their Friends and their Enemies, by holding within the palms of their hands the Reſults of War and Peace, finding both in the one and the other, thoſe Advantages and Safeties which this Nation moſt deſired.</p>
               <p>But laying aſide theſe old abſolete Maxims, from which notwithſtanding wiſe men will not willingly depart without the preſſure of ſome invincible Neceſſity, to come to the Circumſtances of the preſent time: It is evident that the War of the <hi>Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries</hi> cannot poſſible terminate otherwiſe than by the Fall and Oppreſſion of one of the two Parties, or by an Accommodation made betwixt them. If they do agree, and that <hi>England</hi> hath no ſhare in the Treaty, who will aſſure us that they'l not unite for our Ruine; or at leaſt, <hi>France,</hi> which cannot remain long without War, will not turn their Arms againſt us? But if <hi>Spain</hi> falls, we ſhall then be like Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Ropes that have loſt their Counterpoiſe, and ſo are ready to tumble down every ſtep they make. What good opinion ſoever we have of <hi>France,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, notwithſtanding, that in this Caſe, after the <hi>French</hi> have triumphed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Spain,</hi> they will be Maſters over our Fortune too; and that our being thus muſt intirely depend upon their Moderation. For, Gentlemen, do you think that we can take reſt ſecurely upon ſo weak a Foundation as the Giddineſs of their Charity is? ſince 'tis certain that the <hi>moſt Chriſtian King</hi> hath too much Ardour and Deſire of Glory to dwell in Idleneſs at home, after ſuch a Conqueſt. And therefore ſeeing his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions and Reputation notably increaſed, he will form to himſelf new <hi>Idea</hi>'s of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging the Bounds of his Empire both by Sea and <hi>Land,</hi> according to the knowledge which we have of the divers Inclinations to his Court; whereof ſome will put him on to become Maſter of the Commerce of <hi>Europe,</hi> and employ thoſe vaſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures he hath heaped together in order to that Deſign this way; others, to engage him in the finiſhing of his Conqueſts over all the <hi>Low Countries:</hi> and ſome likewiſe, to begin by us to open the Path to the Subduing of all other States which may probably oppoſe this Deſign. So that which Advice ſoever of theſe he doth embrace, 'twill be equally dangerous as to us here, and perpetually oblige us to ſtand upon our Guard, with the Burthen of a continued Expence on our backs, as well as the Incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a War, though we ſeem to be in Peace with him.</p>
               <p>On this Poſition then I ſay, that the worſt Party for <hi>England</hi> that can be taken, whether by choice or neceſſity, is that of ſitting Neuters. By uniting with <hi>Spain</hi> we do follow our ancient Maxim and Intereſt, which hath ever been ſucceſsful to this Nation, which is, to be ſtill Maſters of the Balance betwixt theſe two Monarchies, as I urged before. Should we therefore embrace the Party of <hi>France,</hi> we may hope for a conſiderable portion in the Spoils of <hi>Spain.</hi> And both in the one and the other caſe we ſhall find our Surety and other Advantages in the Treaties of Peace which ſhall be made. But by remaining Neutral we muſt needs equally offend both; and ſo cannot eſchew being expoſed friendleſs to the Reſentments and the Ambition of the Conqueror, as well as the Scorn and the Reproaches of all the reſt of Chriſtendom, for having inſipidly abandoned our proper Reaſon of State, without being either good or wicked in a matter of ſuch univerſal Concernment, whereby the name of <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> will remain ſo much in the Oblivion of <hi>Europe,</hi> that no body will ſcarce remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber there is ſuch a Nation in the World; excepting only thoſe who have a mind to Conquer us.</p>
               <p>I read in the Scripture, ſo baſe a Character of none, as of them who are <hi>neither hot nor cold:</hi> And able Stateſmen have always reproved this kind of Tepidneſs or Half-conduct, to be both unuſeful and dangerous. <hi>Media via nec Amicos parat, nec Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micos tollit.</hi> Wherefore <hi>England</hi> muſt of neceſſity either preſerve the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Uſurpation of the <hi>French,</hi> which is our Bulwark; or raiſe a new Fence, that ſhall ſhelter us from being conquered.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:48501:11"/>
               <p>To preſerve the firſt then, <hi>Spain</hi> muſt be aſſiſted from hence; and to make a new Rampart, we muſt divide the Spoil with <hi>France.</hi> Experience hath ſufficiently ſhewn us, that our Ports are not inacceſſible; and Reaſon demonſtrates, that thoſe can never be ſecure from the like Attempts, but by keeping a powerful Fleet out at Sea, that we may be abſolute Maſters there. 'Tis a Maxim alſo which admits nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of exception nor diminution, That a well-governed Kingdom is obliged to arm when War is kindled in the Neighbourhood. And though we ſhould reſolve to take part neither with the one Intereſt nor the other; yet we muſt be in a Poſture to hinder the Torrent from coming upon our Land, that ſo the Conquerour may not have a mind to extend his Conqueſts hitherwards. Here then is the Charge of Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which on this Conjuncture is inevitable, the equipping of a Fleet, and raiſing of Souldiers to be mutually entertained at the charge of the People, if we do not ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily take ſome Party; and all this Expence without Glory, or hope to get any fruit by ſo unprofitable a Counſel, wherein our Souldiers will never learn the Diſcipline of War, or extract any Utility from ſuch Prizes, as being uncapable after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to ſhare in the Booty, or in the Victories and Treaties of Accommodation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſeveral events. Whereas by taking part either with <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> the Charge would be much leſs, becauſe he whom we aid would largely contribute towards it; and the Prizes gotten at Sea might help to diſcharge the Expence both of the Naval and the Land-Forces. And thus would our Souldiers be exerciſed, and our Nation make a noiſe again abroad, and regain the Reputation which we have of late but too ignominiouſly loſt in the World. For when our men ſhall be trained up dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſtrict Diſcipline beyond Seas, we ſhall by this means eſtabliſh a Seminary of good and able fighting men at the Coſt of others, which will be the firm Pillars of the Party, and render us conſiderable in the eyes of all our Neighbours. Beſides, this courſe may be a vent ſo to diſcharge the Realm of ill humours, and a great company of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle perſons, which now, being without Employment, are a burthen to the Publick, and who one day are capable too of diſturbing the domeſtick Tranquility of the State: whereas, on the contrary, what Succeſs ſoever this War ſhall have, we ſhall always find our Accompt in the end of an Accommodation, whereof, being thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, we cannot fail of having the principal benefit and part.</p>
               <p>All theſe Conſiderations then ſeem unto me to be ſo convincing, that they do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige me abſolutely to condemn the Opinion of Neutrality, as inconſiſtent with our Glory, Safety, and Fundamental Reaſons of State; by concluding poſitively, that we ought to lend an ear to thoſe Propoſitions which ſhall be made unto us from all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and embrace thoſe which ſhall be found to be moſt agreeable and convenient to the Intereſt of the Kingdom. And in the interim, to be the more conſidered by both theſe great Parties, and better aſſured againſt all manner of Attempts; my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is, That without any longer loſs of time, a ſtrong Fleet ſhould be preſently got ready; and that as many days as we have to ſpare before the next Campagne, ſince now every hour is precious that is not well ſpent as to this purpoſe, may be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to render us henceforwards neceſſary unto them whoſe Cauſe we ſhall reſolve to embrace, and as formidable to thoſe againſt whom we intend to declare: ſo that on both ſides we may be the Commanders of the whole Affairs, and give it reſpite or motion by the ſole Rule of the Intereſts of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After that he had ſpoken thus, I did obſerve by the Countenance of the other two perſons that had not yet ſpoken, that this Diſcourſe did not diſpleaſe them; wherefore without any farther Reflection, one of them briskly began to ſpeak to this effect:</p>
               <p>Your Reaſons, ſaid he, are ſo convincing, that I do not only render my conſent unto them without any Reply, but mean to make uſe of them to ſerve as the <hi>Baſs</hi> and Foundation of that Edifice which I have a long time meditated upon, in order to the fundamental Maxims of State of this Nation. Therefore, without more cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony or delay, I ſee that we muſt act, and take one of the two Parties. For any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Counſel would be dangerous and deſtructive, by expoſing of us to a thouſand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies, which all the humane Prudence imaginable cannot be capable of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting or avoiding in proceſs of time. I remain alſo agreed with you, that in the choice of which Party we are to take, we ought not to conſider more than juſt what our own Intereſt properly is, which is the Rule of that conduct of Monarchs, that, as the Soul and the Spirit vivifying the whole Figure before us, gives it motion in the Body of the State.</p>
               <p>It reſts then to Form the Conſequences upon theſe Principles, and decide which of the two Parties is the moſt convenient. <hi>France</hi> offers Roſes unto us; <hi>Spain</hi> nothing but Thorns. The firſt preſents us with a Scheme of Conqueſts without Dangers; the laſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48501:11"/>with proſpect of Dangers without Profit. The one invites us to be their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of aſſured Victories, of which they have already beaten the way; the other doth ſollicite us and implore our Aid only to help them out of the mire, without any other Benefit than, as the old Proverb ſays, <hi>There's your labour for your pains,</hi> at the price of our Bloud and Lives. If we ſhall engage in the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Spain,</hi> in ſuccouring them we run a <hi>Riſco</hi> of being loſt our ſelves, without yet being able to re-eſtabliſh them: but by joyning with <hi>France,</hi> we ſhall partake of the Spoiles with them, which we can never by force be able to take out of their hands: ſince the Progreſs of <hi>France</hi> is now arrived at ſuch a point of Effect, that all our Powers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined together are not ſufficient to ſtop it; and then both our Reſiſtances and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours will ſerve but to ruine the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the ſooner, and bring the Vengeance of the <hi>French</hi> upon our own heads. And if <hi>Spain</hi> comes to ſink under the Weight of the War, all the burthen of that Fall centers upon <hi>England</hi> alone. In fine, 'tis agitated therefore ſingly as to this particular, Whether we will needs chuſe to embark in a Veſſel ſo driven with ſtorms, or in a Ship which ſails at eaſe with full Sails, ſeconded with the favourable Gales of Fortune.</p>
               <p>But in caſe all theſe material Objections cannot divert us from engaging in the ill Fortune of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> let us ſee on what Terms at leaſt we can aſſiſt them uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If we ſhall ſend Troops into the <hi>Low Countreys</hi> to their Aid, 'tis, in effect, to overwhelm them by the very weight and charge of thoſe Succours, and ſacrifice ſo many of our own Subjects to Famine and Miſery, as we do thus ſend Souldiers unto them; becauſe they have neither Countrey enough left to Lodge them in when they come thither, nor the means to Entertain them after once they are there.</p>
               <p>If we ſuccour them meerly by Sea, that kind of help will not hinder <hi>France</hi> from taking of their Towns in the mean time one by one; and ſo though we ſhould a little incommodate <hi>France,</hi> we ſhall not eaſe <hi>Flanders</hi> at all, and ſuch an Aſſiſtance will in Concluſion prove none, becauſe 'tis an Application of the Plaiſter too remotely, and on the wrong ſide of the Wound.</p>
               <p>If then the Loſs of the <hi>Low Countreys</hi> be inevitable, let us do what we can; were it not much better that we ſhould have our ſhare in the Parcels of ſo great a Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, then to ſuffer <hi>France</hi> to ingroſs them all to themſelves? ſince ſuppoſing that we do divide Booties with the <hi>French</hi> on this Occaſion, the Places which by this means muſt neceſſarily fall into our hands will be ſo many new Bulwarks to <hi>England,</hi> which may ſhelter us for the future againſt their vaſt Deſigns, of which the Partiſans of <hi>Spain</hi> make a Chimerical Monſter, to intimidate the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from taking part with their beſt and propereſt Intereſt in the Caſe. But when once we are entered into a Communion of Conqueſts with the <hi>French,</hi> the ſubduing of <hi>Flanders</hi> will ſerve us as Ladders to arrrive at other Projects by, wherein we may probably hope to find our Profit and Satisfaction mutually together, as well as the Pleaſure of a juſt Revenge. I ſet aſide the Conqueſt of the <hi>Indies,</hi> which we could not fail to encompaſs, whil'ſt <hi>France</hi> doth hold all the Forces of <hi>Spain</hi> in play both at Sea and Land, and ſo occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, that they'll never be able to retain what they hold in the <hi>New World,</hi> no more than that remainder of Territories which yet they ſtand poſſeſſed of nearer hand.</p>
               <p>Wherefore as to what regards the Intereſt of this Kingdom, what I have laſt ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged methinks might ſuffice to make you of my Opinion. And if we do impartially conſider that of the <hi>Royal Family,</hi> What can be more important and convenient for it, than to have at their Devotion a Neighbouring Power hard by, which is ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable, and that is able to protect them in a few hours from all manner of Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions that they may (and perhaps not without cauſe neither) apprehend at home, by thus commanding both the Treaſures and the Armies of <hi>France,</hi> whenever they ſhall have any need of them, to put a Bridle in the mouths of all ſuch as do ſeek to check their Authority?</p>
               <p>I avow that our propereſt Intereſt were to hold the Ballance equal between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> if we could; but we ſhould then have thought ſooner of that, whil'ſt theſe matters were in a condition to be diſputed: For at preſent, the Weight of the Caſe inclining totally to one ſide, ſo that we can no longer oppoſe <hi>France</hi> with <hi>Spain</hi> as a Barricado againſt their Deſigns, we muſt now think how to become our ſelves the Counterpoiſe of <hi>France</hi> and the Defence of <hi>Europe,</hi> by eſtabliſhing of our Power beyond Seas on ſolid Foundations, that all other Princes, may conſider us hereafter as the only People who are capable of reſiſting the Deſign of the <hi>Univerſal Monarchy;</hi> and ſo as <hi>France</hi> it ſelf may not be able impunitively to thwart <hi>England</hi> in this Reſolution, becauſe then our Safety will be much more firmly ſetled by our
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48501:12"/>own Strength than with the Force of others; and all thoſe who apprehend the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of <hi>France</hi> will conjoyn with us, and become tyed to the Fortune of <hi>England,</hi> as they would be at this inſtant to <hi>Spain,</hi> if they ſaw that Monarchy in a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be able to maintain them.</p>
               <p>So that all thoſe Reaſons do oblige me to conclude, that we muſt no longer heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on this point of taking part with <hi>France,</hi> and accept of thoſe Advantagious Offers which the <hi>French</hi> make unto us, both in reſpect of the publick Good of Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endom, as well as our own particular Security; ſince by being united to them in a Knot of ſuch inſeparable Conditions, and on ſuch a Conjuncture of Affairs, becauſe of which they dare refuſe us nothing that we ask, what need we fear from the oppoſite Conjunction of any other Parties?</p>
               <p>All the Aſſiſtents at this Conference began to expreſs Indignation againſt this part of his Diſcourſe, and ſhewed by their Unquietneſs all the while that he ſpake thus, that they had much ado to keep from interrupting of him, or to refrain from anſwering tumultuouſly, before that he had made an end. But as they offered to reply in heat all at once, to deliver their thoughts on this Subject, the Maſter of the Houſe, who had not yet delivered his ſenſe to the Company, broke ſilence, and with a little ſmile, which had ſomething in it grave, and ſcornful, dexterouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled together, addreſſing himſelf to him who had ſpoken with ſo much length juſt before, held on the Debate as follows.</p>
               <p>I know your Prudence, my Lord, too well (ſays he), and your Lordſhip's diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed Zeal for the good of the State, to believe that you can mean ſeriouſly what you have urged on the behalf of <hi>France;</hi> but rather am perſwaded, (and that eaſily too) that with an ingenious Artifice you have thus diſguiſed your own true Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this Caſe, the better to penetrate into the bottom of our ours, and ſo give Opportunity to ſee clearlier through all the Reaſons and the Doubts which may be formed there upon touching this Matter, of which we do now treat; ſince the truth of any Argument doth never ſo well appear and endure the light, as when it is ſif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the very root, and that the Reflexion thereof is exalted by the Oppoſition of the contrary ſenſe. So that in combating with your Opinion, I ſhall ſtill think that we do not diſagree, but rather to diſſent in the Expoſition of a vain Phantaſm, which you erected for ſport ſake to divert us, and give the Company Recreation.</p>
               <p>Allow me then to tell you, that this Project, upon which you have thus exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the accuteneſs of your Wit with ſo great a grace, is both unprofitable and chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical, no leſs then ſhameful and unjuſt, and ruinous towards <hi>England</hi> to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and purpoſes whatſoever: whereas the Deſign of ſuccouring <hi>Spain</hi> is facil, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, profitable, neceſſary, and ſuitable to the Fundamental Maxims of our State. And if you pleaſe to afford me never ſo little attention, it will not be difficult for me to prove unto you very clearly according to your own Judgment, what I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of this Nature; that we ſhall perfectly accord in one and the ſame Reſult, and convince you fully of the Truth thereof.</p>
               <p>The Deſign which you mention, is of the like nature, that it were to demoliſh an old ſtrong Edifice, to build an new Caſtle in the Air; or like his, who, to renew his Youth, conſented to be cut into pieces, and put his ſeveral members into an Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick of Glaſs. To follow your Counſel then, we muſt alter the whole Conſtitution of our Politicks, from innovated Intereſts and Foreign Maxims, by turning all things upſide down, even from the Accidents to the very <hi>Genius</hi> of the Nation, and diſtil more modern Bloud into the veins of the People, then that which they have hereditari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received from Father to Son. But let us, I beſeech you, examine on what ground, and with what Materials this new Edifice is to be raiſed. That Earth which you have propoſed unto us to make it out of, is a moving ſort of Sand, or a Floating Iſland, in which we can never fix on any firm Bottom. 'Tis upon <hi>France</hi> that you would have us eſtabliſh our Fortune, to found a Power which one day may counterbalance the Power of the <hi>French,</hi> or at leaſt ſhelter us from their vaſt Deſigns. Nay, you will needs have <hi>France</hi> made the Inſtrument of a greatneſs in a Neighbour, which they ought to ſuſpect, if they be not beſotted by ſo putting <hi>England</hi> into a ſtate to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble e're long to ſtop their Progreſſes, and erect a Bulwark in us againſt themſelves. As if <hi>France,</hi> that is our hereditary Enemy, and hath ſo often tried what we are able to do againſt the Enlarging of their Empire; who have graven deep in their hearts the injury of the Title which (to their ſhame) <hi>England</hi> carries in all publick Treaties, and her Trophees in reference to that Crown; this very <hi>France,</hi> which hath no greater deſire then to take the Dominion of the Sea from us, and the Precedency in Commerce, will help us (as you believe) to conquer the <hi>Indies,</hi> in which one third
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48501:12"/>part of his Realm is intereſſed, and of which they do ſuck away all the Marrow with the ſemination of their Baubles, by the ill husbandry of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> She who juſt now comes from Joyning with our Enemies againſt us, after ſhe had firſt contrived how to broach the Quarrel between <hi>England,</hi> and the States of the <hi>United Provinces</hi> under divers falſe motions; who ſnatched the Victory out of our hands, when we were morally certain of beating the <hi>Dutch;</hi> who reduced the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> to a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſeparating from us in this War, after that he had received our Aſſiſtance in large Sums of Money; debauched <hi>Denmark</hi> from our party; hindred the <hi>Swedes</hi> to arm in our favour, and contrived the whole Fabrick of that Affront which we recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the River of <hi>Thames:</hi> Can you, after all theſe demonſtrations of the Rancour which they bear in their hearts againſt <hi>England,</hi> be ſo uningenuous as to believe that the <hi>French</hi> will make a Bridge for us on the other ſide of the Sea, as ſincerely intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by this means to make us participate of their conqueſts with them, or ever to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in a ſound Amity with our Intereſts? For God's ſake then diſabuſe your ſelf, as ſoon as you can, out of this groſs Errour, if it be ſo that it hath got the leaſt Fixation in your mind; ſince you cannot cordially reaſon thus, or have the leaſt hope of ſuch an Incongruity in the Reaſon of State of other Nations, without conceiving at the ſame time that the <hi>French</hi> have loſt both their Wits and Judgment; of which yet there is no great reaſon why we ſhould think, as they have handled us in this matter of Negotiations of late: for therein I am ſure that we do find them to have more than common ſenſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>France</hi> indeed will be glad to have us for the Inſtruments of their Ambition, but never for Companions of their Glory, or Rivals to their Greatneſs. The <hi>French</hi> do, I confeſs, ſeek to make uſe of us to pull the Cheſnut out of the Fire, to ſave the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their fingers; but when that is done, the <hi>French</hi> will not endure that we ſhould eat any bit of the Kernel. And the work which they do now make for us, both at home and abroad, is ſo incompatible with our Intereſt and Deſigns, as well as their own, that their Profeſſions towards us at this time cannot poſſibly be ſincere; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be grown ſo kind on a ſuddain, as to overthrow all their Fundamental Laws, and in favour of <hi>England</hi> change the whole face of their Deſigns which they have hitherto been forming upon <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They pretend that the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> are entirely fallen to them by the right of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, which <hi>France</hi> hath forged to belong to its ſelf. Then are all thoſe Provinces by conſequence united to the <hi>French</hi> Crown, nor can their King divide or alienate any part of them.</p>
               <p>If this be true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to our advantage, though he would never ſo fain, but that it muſt be ſubject ſtill to return again to their Tribunal, they have annulled the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation</hi> of the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and thereby have formed a Right to the Succeſſion of that Monarchy, in caſe the young King ſhould come to fail of a Succeſſor. So that the moſt Chriſtian King can give us no ſhare in the diſmembring of <hi>Spain,</hi> without doing prejudice to a Right which he pretends to be acquired unalie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably to his Crown, and whereof he himſelf may not otherwiſe diſpoſe.</p>
               <p>Next, let us view the Materials which we are to have, to build this new Edifice with. Either we muſt undertake this War at our own Charge, or at the Expence of <hi>France.</hi> If it be undertaken at the Coſt of <hi>France,</hi> we muſt be their Hirelings (at beſt) as the <hi>Tartars</hi> be to the <hi>Ottomons;</hi> and cannot move one ſtep beyond What and How they'l have us act: <hi>France,</hi> on theſe terms, will always hold the Bridle in our Teeth, and the <hi>Caveſſan</hi> upon our Noſes, to make us ſtop, turn and wind, in the middle of the Courſes, juſt as they pleaſe. From the very firſt moment that we ſhall grow burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome unto them, they have but to withdraw their Supplies, to make us fall headlong to the Ground; and then the Share which we pretend in their Conqueſts doth pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and arbitrarily depend on their diſcretion.</p>
               <p>But if we ſhall underake to carry on this Deſign out of our own proper Purſe, who ſhall furniſh us with the Means of doing it? Do you believe that the Parliament and the People will give away their Subſtance to act againſt the true Intereſts of the Realm? and that they'l Bleed, to quench the ambitious Thirſt of the <hi>French?</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy <hi>Spain,</hi> from whence all the abundance of our Commerce is derived; and which even at this Inſtant grants unto us ſuch notable Advantages by a Treaty which is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly ratified?</p>
               <p>The part which <hi>France</hi> doth offer us in the Conqueſts of <hi>Oſtend</hi> and <hi>Neuport</hi> is a vaſt Liberality indeed, but ſtill of other folks Goods. It would become them far better to reſtore back <hi>Dunkirk</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> which they cheated us of by Surprize; or the Town of <hi>Callis,</hi> which they have diſmembred from our ancient Dominion. They take
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48501:13"/>from us what is our own already, and preſent us with nothing but what is not in their power to give; becauſe they cannot beſtow either the Title or the Poſſeſſion of what they do offer in this Kind upon us; which if we will have, we muſt gain it by the Point of the Sword. And this Train which they do ſhew us, is of the ſame nature with that ſort of Temptations with which the Devil tempted our Saviour from the top of the Pinnacle. But do not you diſcover that this is a ſubtil Artifice to imbroil us again in a now War with the States of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> who have the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to defend theſe two Places as much as if either <hi>Amſterdam</hi> or <hi>Fluſhing</hi> were ſo deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon? And without an abſolute Naval Victory we can never hope to conquer them; and ſuch a Conqueſt at Sea too, as ſhall put the <hi>Hollanders</hi> out of all manner of poſſibility to afford any Succours in this Caſe. This is a very hard bone which <hi>France</hi> doth caſt in for us to gnaw, whil'ſt they eat all the Marrow of it. In fine, when the Arms of <hi>France,</hi> joyned to our Forces, ſhall have put us poſſeſſion of theſe two Places; yet they'll be totally unuſeful to <hi>England,</hi> when <hi>France</hi> is poſſeſſed of all the reſt: Becauſe thus the <hi>French</hi> will ſhut us quite out of the whole Traffick of the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> and will be always in a Condition to drive the <hi>Engliſh</hi> away from thence, unleſs we do reſolve continually to keep a Fleet at Sea for the conſerving of them.</p>
               <p>If this Deſign be hollow and viſionary, it is not leſs ſhameful then airy and full of Injuſtice. We have no manner of Pretention on the Monarchy of <hi>Spain,</hi> nor is it our <hi>Genius</hi> to whet our Spirits to form Caſtles in the Clouds of Chimerical Rights. What Glory can it be to our Arms to help to oppreſs a King in Minority, of ſix years old, by ſurprize; only becauſe we find him now to be rudely attacqued and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided; on a frivolous Pretext, immediately after the <hi>French</hi> had given the Queen his Mother, and his principal Miniſters of State at <hi>Madrid,</hi> ſuch ſolemn aſſurances to the contrary, as well as at <hi>Paris,</hi> touching the inviolable continuation of a good Peace and a ſincere Friendſhip? The manner which <hi>Spain</hi> hath held and acted with us newly in relation to <hi>England,</hi> when we were aſſaulted by three powerful Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at one time, ought to oblige us, at leaſt to be deaf to the artificial Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>France.</hi> For although the <hi>French</hi> have tried by all the ways imaginable, and with Offers incomparably more advantagious than thoſe which they do make to us at preſent, to the end that ſo they might have gained the Forces of <hi>Spain</hi> to unite with them to our inevitable Oppreſſion; yet was it never in their Power to ſhake the unalterable Amity which the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nation have for us by a kind of natural Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, which one knows not how better to expreſs than by the Immutability of it, whether we do oblige or diſoblige them. Would it not then be an Ingratitude totally inconſiſtent with the Honour and the Hoſpitality of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Temper, ſo ſoon to forget this Kindneſs; ſince at the ſame inſtant that <hi>Spain</hi> was the deeplieſt engaged againſt <hi>Portugal,</hi> they did notwithſtanding openly oppoſe the Deſigns of <hi>France</hi> which ſeemed to the prejudice of <hi>England,</hi> by refuſing them (in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of us, firmly and with great Reſolution) Paſſage for thoſe Troops of theirs which they ſent to ruine the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> our Ally and Confederate then. We cannot complain of any Injury or Attempt wherein the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have tampered againſt <hi>England.</hi> No League nor ancient Treaty doth oblige us to ſecond the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of <hi>France;</hi> and we cannot conclude new Aliances with the <hi>French</hi> to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, without directly contravening that Treaty which we have lately ratified with <hi>Spain.</hi> Let us ſee then what the Herald is to ſay to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that ſhall be ſent to denounce War unto them on this Occaſion from <hi>England;</hi> or with what Reaſons we ſhall be able to fill a <hi>Manifeſto</hi> which we would offer to the Publick, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to juſtifie the Cauſes of this Rupture. Wherefore I leave the Care, my Lord, to you, being that you ſeem to be the Author of this Counſel, to found it well in the point of Juſtice. But pray, ſee that you perform it better and with more grace than the Writer of the Queen of <hi>France</hi>'s <hi>Prepenſions</hi> hath done.</p>
               <p>I ſay farther yet, That this Deſign is both prejudicial and deſtructive; and that it carries along with it moſt pernicious Conſequences, as well in the preſent time as the time to come. For from the very moment that we do break with <hi>Spain,</hi> our Commerce will ceaſe, with the Effects of all thoſe great Advantages which the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> have
<note n="*" place="margin">By the Treaty laſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi> by the Earl of <hi>Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour there.</note> newly granted unto us: and the Merchants of this Realm, who trade there, will juſtly be confiſcated; ſince all the Profit that we draw from thence muſt on theſe terms infallibly redound in favour of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> whileſt our Arms do bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the <hi>Low Countries;</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> as they do their utmoſt againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> at the ſame inſtant will ſeize their principal Ports into their Power, and thus become abſolute Maſters of the Commerce, by putting themſelves into a

                  </gap>itim Power to increaſe, which ſhe ſo diligently kept down throughout the whole Courſe of her Reign. Whereas you are ſo far from oppoſing the Growth of this Power, that you rather ſeem to deſire <hi>England</hi> ſhould facilitate the ways to make it grow the faſter, and render it yet more formidable than it is, by the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of the Sea Ports, which in concluſion muſt infallibly bring <hi>France</hi> to be Miſtreſs of the Commerce of the <hi>Indies.</hi> All the World knows the vaſt quantity of Money and Arms which the <hi>French</hi> have accumulated to that end alone out of the richeſt Purſes of that Kingdom. I agree to what hath been ſaid before very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently in this Conference, that our Power and Greatneſs doth principally conſiſt in the matter of Commerce; and therefore I conclude even from thence, by an uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Conſequence, that Commerce ought to be the chief Object of our Jealouſie, and that we are bound to be as tender of the Conſervation of this Benefit as of the Apples of our Eyes. But then we muſt look far off how to prevent whatſoever may hinder the Progreſs of Trade, or diminiſh the Abundance of this Commerce. We have nothing to fear in this particular on the Account of <hi>Spain,</hi> which applies little towards Traffick, and leaveth almoſt all the Advantages thereof freely to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> in their own proper Ports. But if this Intereſt ſhould fall into the Power of an induſtrious and active Nation, and a People covetous of Gain, as the <hi>French</hi> are, we are not to expect any Share of the Utility, or to partake with <hi>France</hi> therein; but rather that they will preſcribe the Law of Commerce unto the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> according to their own Will and Pleaſure. As ſoon as ever 'tis known that we do treat of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with <hi>France,</hi> one of theſe two things muſt neceſſarily happen: either that <hi>Spain,</hi> finding it ſelf uncapable to reſiſt the Union of both Forces, will ſend a Blank to the <hi>French</hi> King to make ſuch Conditions with them as he thinks beſt, by conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto him all their Portion in the <hi>Low Countreys;</hi> or that all the reſt of the Powers of <hi>Europe,</hi> juſtly apprehending ſo terrible an Union, will joyn with <hi>Spain</hi> to ſtop the Torrent of our Deſigns. In the firſt ſtate of the Caſe then, we ſhall quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find our ſelves taken for perſons deluded in this Negotiation, and <hi>France</hi> only ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the Fruit of the Couzenage; of which the Shame of having been ſo groſly cheated can only remain to us, when the whole World diſcerns that the deſire of Prey hath prevailed with <hi>England</hi> above the Faith of thoſe ſolemn Treaties, which we have made with the Crown of <hi>Spain:</hi> and thus ſhall we obtain no other Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by having made ſuch a falſe ſtep, then to have facilitated the means for <hi>France</hi> to unite all the <hi>Low Countreys</hi> to that Crown without ſtriking one Blow, to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and irreparable Damage of the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> For who can aſſure us, that from the ſame inſtant when we do declare unto <hi>France</hi> our intention to unite with them, the <hi>French,</hi> inſtead of uniting their Party with <hi>England,</hi> will not rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail the ſooner in their Pretenſions with <hi>Spain,</hi> to make the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> becauſe of this Apprehenſion, diſpoſed to accord to whatſoever <hi>France</hi> ſhall demand? which is as the old Proverb ſays, <hi>To keep the Mule at our Coſt,</hi> and hold the ſtirrup unto the <hi>French;</hi> or play a ridiculous part, in making uſe only of Scare-crows, and give a falſe Alarm to favour the Deſigns of others.</p>
               <p>Next, who ſhall ſecure us that after <hi>Spain</hi> hath yielded, becauſe of this Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the <hi>Low Countreys</hi> to the Diſpoſition of <hi>France,</hi> That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> ſhall not then ſtreightly unite together, to be revenged of us, and bring us down? The affinity of Bloud, Religion, and the hopes which the <hi>Moſt Chriſtian King</hi> may found to himſelf upon the Succeſſion to this Monarchy, (if the <hi>Renunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the Queen once comes to be annulled) are ſtrong Links that may very well unite them together; and the principal of the Diviſion which is at preſent betwixt them, having no other foundation but reciprocal Jealouſie touching the Equality of their Power, this Emulation will expire as ſoon as ever that <hi>France</hi> doth ſee <hi>Spain</hi> in a Condition to be no longer able to diſpute the Sovereign Arbitrage of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> with them; and the cauſe of their Hatred being taken away, all the Effects thereof will ceaſe likewiſe. And then the common Intereſts of both will unite them in a Bond which is inſeparable any more, from whence our Ruine muſt infallibly ariſe: becauſe the Subſtance and Surety of <hi>England</hi> ſolely depends upon the Emulation of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48501:14"/>theſe two Powers, as the Temperament of a humane Body conſiſts in the Oppoſition of the Elementary Qualities.</p>
               <p>But what ſhall we ſay of the States of the <hi>United Provinces?</hi> Can we reaſonably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they'll remain without Motion, or that they'll not awaken at the noiſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of this Negotiation, which we ſhall carry on with <hi>France</hi> to the Deſtruction of <hi>Spain?</hi> Since 'tis evident, they have no other courſe to take than to prevent us, but by joyning themſelves with <hi>France</hi> before we have finiſhed this Treaty, or elſe to bind their Intereſts faſt with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Crown and the Empire on the firſt Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And then are we excluded from our Pretenſions, and all the hopes of our vaſt Conqueſts, which we have fancied unto our ſelves. And in the next place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſhall we be replunged into a long and dangerous War; from whence we came but juſt now, as it were, to eſcape with ſo much difficulty and damage. <hi>France</hi> hath yet propoſed nothing unto us directly touching the Ports of <hi>Oſtend</hi> and <hi>Newport</hi> to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and 'tis apparent as to <hi>England,</hi> by ſundry authentick Documents, that the <hi>French</hi> have no mind to treat ſeriouſly with us on this Point, unleſs that they do find us diſpoſed to unite with <hi>Spain</hi> and the States of the <hi>United Provinces</hi> for the common Defence. Whereas 'tis no leſs certain, that the <hi>French</hi> have expreſly made the very ſame Propoſitions, and more advantagious ones, unto the ſaid States, by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciting them to re-combine with <hi>France</hi> in order to their old Deſign of dividing the <hi>Low Countries</hi> mutually between each other, to the entire Excluſion both of us and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> being fully agreed as to this particular, at the beginning of the War paſt.</p>
               <p>Whereby 'tis clearly to be forſeen, that <hi>France</hi> conſiders us no farther then as the worſt of their Proſpects, and that the <hi>French</hi> will always be ready to buy dearer the Amity of the States of the <hi>United Provinces</hi> than ours. Would it not then be a great imprudence in us, to ſerve them as Inſtruments on ſuch diſgraceful and diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Terms, to contribute towards the engaging of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to their Party? It being out of doubt, that the Jealouſie which we ſhould ſo give them of our Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation with <hi>France</hi> would be a powerful incitement to the States, to put them upon being before hand with us in this Treaty, and cut the Graſs after this manner under our feet. But admit all this ſhould ceaſe, I do not ſee what Meaſures we can take at this time with <hi>France,</hi> nor what Aſſurances or Precautions the <hi>French</hi> may give us in a Treaty, ſo as to ſhelter <hi>England</hi> from the Danger of that known Maxim of theirs, which is, In all Confederations to be bound by no other Rule but their Intereſt meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I avow that the Rupture of the <hi>Pyrenean Treaty</hi> frights me, and the remembrance of their Proceeding held with us heretofore throughout all the Courſe of our late War with <hi>Holland</hi> hath made me ſo incredulous, that they muſt ſhew me many miracles, and evident ones too, before I ſhall be converted to have the leaſt good Opinion of the Sincerity of their Faith and Dealing.</p>
               <p>That which you have alledged touching the Support which the Royal Houſe of <hi>England</hi> may particularly hope for from the Amity of <hi>France,</hi> is both a delicate and a dangerous Stone to ſtir. The Glory and the Safety of our <hi>King</hi> doth only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the Love of his People, and a ſtreight Union betwixt His <hi>Majeſty</hi> and his preſent <hi>Parliament,</hi> ſince He hath no other ſound Intereſt to rely upon but that of the Kingdom, having need of no other Arms or Aſſiſtance. The hearty affections of His Subjects and His own Royal Vertues will be as ſo many Cittadels erected to maintain His Authority; and any other project is contrary both to His Genious and His admirable Prudence. For all thoſe who ſhall dare to inſpire any other thoughts into His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> will infallibly undergo the weight of His Diſpleaſure, as Enemies to His Fame and Quiet. But at the Bottom of all, what help can He rationally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from <hi>France,</hi> ſhould He come to need it, (which God defend) after their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy abandoning of the <hi>King</hi> His Father in His great Diſtreſs, and of the <hi>King</hi> which now is likewiſe, when the Wheel of <hi>Fortune</hi> ran againſt them, even to the Exſtirpation of the Royal Line, had not He by whom Kings reign, wonderfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored them to the Throne of their Anceſtors? It was that ſhameful Treaty which the <hi>French</hi> ratified with thoſe Uſurpers then, that ſacrificed <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt to the Ambition of the Tyrant <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> who had ſnatched the Scepter from the right Owners and Proprietors thereof. Nay, to ſuch a Degree was the Inhoſpitabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>France</hi> grown at that time, though His Father were thus execrably Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the Eyes of the <hi>French,</hi> our King's own Couſin-german refuſed Him a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat that might be ſecure for His own Perſon. Therefore 'tis fit that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould be diſabuſed once for all, by being better informed, ſince <hi>France</hi> is ſo far from being aſſiſting or uſeful unto us upon this Conjuncture, that in truth they do ſeek only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our Diviſions and Troubles.</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:48501:14"/>
               <p>For 'tis both their Intereſt and Maxim ſo to do: which Conduct hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly and hereditarily obſerved in their Counſels for many Ages together, (and new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the laſt Civil War here) ſince all the Baits which they do preſent unto us are but ſo many Apples of Diſcord, which the <hi>French</hi> Emiſſaries caſt up and down among us, purpoſely to embroil us with our Neighbours, or elſe with one another.</p>
               <p>Next, let us conſider at preſent whether we ſhall find our Accompt better with <hi>Spain.</hi> 'Tis evident that ſolid Reaſon of State doth totally incline us to leave that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; and you cannot but all acknowledge this to be our true Fundamental Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xim, whereby we may keep the Balance <hi>in aequilibrio;</hi> and that our Safety doth moſt conſiſt in ſuch an <hi>aequilibrium:</hi> why then ſhould we ſwerve from thence out of vain hopes, or quit the Body for the Shadow? The Intereſt of Commerce no way invites us to take part with <hi>France:</hi> and this Truth is ſo notorious to all the people of <hi>England,</hi> that there is no Eloquence able to perſwade them contrary to their own Experience therein. The Cauſe is juſt and favourable: A young
<note n="*" place="margin">The King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </note> Pupil unworthily oppreſſed; a Peace ſo ſolemnly and piouſly eſtabliſhed as lightly violated by a Proceſs of Cavils and Legerdemain, by a Proceeding thereupon full of Surpriſals and Violence, as well as Pretenſions unjuſtly revived after an Authentick
<note n="†" place="margin">Vide <hi>The Buckler of State and Juſtice,</hi> Art. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Renunciation;</hi> are ſo many voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which ſpeak to the Root of our Conſciences, to call us to that which we owe to Juſtice, Pitty, good Neighbourhood, the Publick Cauſe of Chriſtendom, and our ſelves. For in this matter is concerned no leſs than the Caſe of Royal Succeſſions, which <hi>France</hi> will needs have ſubmitted to the Cuſtoms of ordinary Citizens, and the Conſervation of that Bulwark which is common to all theſe parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> againſt this Torrent which threatens the whole Vicinity with a great Inundation, and the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring the Tranquility of the Chriſtian Republick againſt an unquiet Nation, that will never deſiſt from diſturbing of it until their Inſolence ſhall be abated.</p>
               <p>The Foundation then being ſo ſolid, becauſe we ſhall in this Oppoſition have to treat with a Nation that makes profeſſion of Honour and Generoſity, which hath never yet been accuſed to be guilty of having violated any Publick Treaty, and that would rather
<note n="‖" place="margin">The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </note> hazzard the loſs of their Monarchy than their Reputation; the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage is both ſecure and conſiderable: whereas on the account of <hi>France</hi> we ſhall appear but as little Acceſſories, and the <hi>French</hi> will carry us on as the Firſt Motion, only according to the rapidneſs of their Progreſs, by applying us meerly in the courſe of their Game to their own Ends: and thus ſhall we become the Miniſters of their Ambition, and be made uſe of like a pair of Stairs, on which they do mean to tread in order to their obtaining the <hi>Univerſal Monarchy.</hi> In fine, their Intereſts, if that we are ſtill predeſtinated to be thus groſly deluded, muſt be the Rule of ours, and our future Conduct too and Operations. But in taking part with <hi>Spain</hi> we ſhall be the Arbitrators of Peace and War, and enabled to give the whole weight unto the Reſolutions of each Party. Then will <hi>France</hi> conſider us with terrour and the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of what our Arms may do, and <hi>Spain</hi> by the addition of our Succours. If we do deſire Conqueſts, we cannot hope for more lawful ones, nor eaſier Victories, than to re-unite by this means our ancient Dominion in <hi>France,</hi> which have formerly been diſmembred from the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> But if we ſhall limit our Deſigns to the ſole eſtabliſhment of a Peace, we can find the Accompt both of Glory and Safety likewiſe therein: ſince it appears by Authentick Letters of <hi>Monſieur de Lionn</hi>'s writing, that <hi>France</hi> is reſolved to be content with Reaſon, as ſoon as ever they do ſee <hi>England</hi> fixed to joyn with <hi>Spain</hi> and the States of the <hi>United Provinces.</hi> So that 'tis in our choice whether to make an advantagious War, or procure an honeſt Peace, at the firſt appearance of our preparations in Arms. Whereas, on the contrary, 'tis evident by the Interception of the aforeſaid Diſpatches, that they will deſpiſe all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Offices and Mediations that are not Armed, but rather purſue vigorouſly their Courſe whither Fortune ſhall drive it on, ſo long as they do meet with no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Obſtacles in the way.</p>
               <p>Therefore, becauſe you ſeem to believe that <hi>Spain</hi> is reduced to ſo low a Condition, that our Relief would be altogether unuſeful to them, and ſerve for nothing but to bring down the Vengeance of <hi>France</hi> exaſperated upon us; for God's ſake, cure your ſelf of this Pannick fear as ſoon as you can. 'Tis <hi>France</hi> endeavours to erect a formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Power, if ſhe finds no Oppoſition in the approaches thereunto; and <hi>Spain</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably muſt ſink under the burthen, unleſs that Crown be ſuccoured: though it is as true alſo, that the Miſchief is eaſily to be prevented, if Remedies be applied thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in due time, and before that the Inconvenience root it ſelf too deep. All the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage which <hi>France</hi> hath gained in this laſt Campaign, is no more than an effect of their Addreſs, and the over-grown Credulity of <hi>Spain,</hi> rather than of their Valour,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48501:15"/>and Power. All the Places which they have conquered in <hi>Flanders,</hi> are but great Country-Towns, where the People being ever the ſtrongeſt, he that is Maſter of the Field carries always the Keys of them at his Girdle, to enter when he pleaſes; and the winning of one Battel recovers them back again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>France</hi> hath conſtantly yielded in every thing where ſhe hath found a real Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, without gaining any thing beyond what the fright of an incommodated Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude hath holpen them to acquire by ſuch a Surpriſing Invaſion. <hi>Spain</hi> hath yet great reſorts to recur unto, provided only they can gain time, and the means of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them meet together, and thus recover their Spirits. We know that ſhe hath made Contracts for conſiderable Sums of Money, and that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are now about to put themſelves in a way to be able ſhortly to withſtand the ſtrongeſt Shocks of the War: and by the little Diverſion of the Forces of <hi>France</hi> which we may make with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any prejudice to <hi>England,</hi> we can certainly put <hi>Spain</hi> into a Condition of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacquing the <hi>French,</hi> as well as of defending it ſelf, and ſo ſhall we reduce <hi>France</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a neceſſity of demanding Peace. <hi>Spain</hi> is not unprovided of Friends nor Allies. The Emperour doth already make a great ſtep in favour of the Circle of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> by taking of it intirely under his Protection, as a Member of his Body. The States of the <hi>United Provinces</hi> are not aſleep, neither as to their own proper Intereſts upon this Conjuncture, and after having tried in vain the ſweeter ways of appeaſing the Tempeſt, they will not abandon themſelves on ſo preſſing an Occaſion, being that they do ſee well enough their Safety depends abſolutely upon their Reſolution. We know that they deſire a ſincere Alliance with us, and that they would make all the progreſſes neceſſary towards it, could they but diſcern in us any real diſpoſition not to reject the Offer. <hi>Sweden,</hi> which is weary to ſerve but as an Inſtrument to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of <hi>France,</hi> to the prejudice of their own Affairs, will no doubt alſo follow our Motions: and the moſt part (whom rather Fear than Love doth tye unto the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>France</hi>) will queſtionleſs take off the Mask, as ſoon as ever they ſhall ſee a conſiderable Power on foot to protect them: <hi>France</hi> is a Body replete with ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which will eaſily degenerate into an univerſal Corruption, when the <hi>French</hi> are never ſo little ſhaken. The Jealouſie alone which our Fleet will give them, muſt needs oblige them to employ the better part of their Troops to furniſh their Maritime Coaſts; and conſequently render them the weaker every where elſe. Beſides, it is plain that in this laſt Campaign, in which they thought to ſwallow all up at a bit, they made all the Force that they were able, and yet were not able notwithſtanding to bring into the Field above Forty thouſand men, after having drawn out of their Garriſons and the Proviſion of their Towns all the ſtrength almoſt that they had there, whereby their Frontiers were left naked. Judge then to what point they'l be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, when they'l be put both to furniſh their Places on all ſides, and divide their Troops too, in <hi>Alſatia, Italy,</hi> the County of
<note n="*" place="margin">or <hi>Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Roſſillon,</hi> and <hi>Flanders;</hi> and that in all theſe Countries they'l meet with Enemies to fight againſt, as well as a multitude of Male-contents at home, no leſs formidable within the Center of their own proper Bowels. For thus they can build no longer upon the ſtrength of their Army, which is deſtroyed very near already by Labour, Sickneſs, Diſeaſes, and want of Pay. Wherefore they muſt begin anew, and with freſh Charges raiſe more men, becauſe the ill uſage which their Troops have received, doth render them ſo barren of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that they are compelled to ſeek Recruits, and as it were beg Supplies, with vaſt ſums of Money, from other States. And this Imaginary Fountain of Treaſure of theirs, which here is thought to be un-exhauſtible, will be found to have a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom when our Fleet doth diſturb their Commerce,
<note place="margin">Which is the ſame thing as our Banquer and Farmers of the Cuſtoms.</note> the Credit which till then they may get with the Partiſans, by means of oppreſſing the People, with Tax upon Tax, will fail. The Men of Buſineſs and the Natives, being preſſed to unſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Extremities, will quickly either caſt off the yoke, or ſink under the burthen and the weight of thoſe Impoſitions. Their incapacity to hold out any longer, is well enough ſeen, by the impoſſibility wherein they now find themſelves to make good what they have promiſed the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> whoſe Friendſhip hath been formerly ſo neceſſary unto them. And if <hi>Spain,</hi> as 'tis hoped that it may do, once ſhall take a Reſolution to be delivered of this inteſtine War with <hi>Portugal</hi> by ſome Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> will ſoon be in a Condition of being uſeful to their Allies, and feared by their Enemies. But if we do ſuffer the Deſigns of <hi>France</hi> to paſs by undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and impunitively to permit them to conquer the <hi>Low Countries</hi> towards the total oppreſſion of <hi>Spain;</hi> then I cannot but avow that <hi>France</hi> thus will be moſt terrible unto us. And in caſe at preſent we are afraid of drawing their Revenge on our heads, then ſhall we have muſt juſter cauſe to apprehend the future effects of their
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48501:15"/>Ambition. Wherefore at the Bottom of all theſe Reaſons, it ſeems to me that by the ſame Principle of Apprehenſion which you have of the <hi>French,</hi> we are obliged to oppoſe theſe Progreſſes of theirs, which if not ſtopped, would yet render them more redoubtable.</p>
               <p>If ſo be that we do fear them in the Field, having ſo many Friends that do tender their Alliance unto us, our fear were much more juſtifiable, if after the rejecting of all thoſe Offers, we alone were expoſed to their mercy; or that our moderation could exempt us from their Out-rages, but on the contrary, rather give the <hi>French</hi> better Conveniencies of putting theſe Violences in Execution, ſhould ſuch an inſipid Counſel prevail; for they'l never conſider us farther than we do make our ſelves Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable. They have printed Books of their Pretenſions to <hi>England.</hi> Experience teaches us (even to this day) that 'tis enough with them to ground a War, without giving them any other cauſe of Hoſtility, That we have
<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </note> Kingdoms belonging to this Monarchy which may very well fit their Deſigns; which is enough to invite the <hi>French</hi> to attack them whil'ſt <hi>England</hi> is weak.</p>
               <p>Hiſtory likewiſe doth ſhew us, how that all our Alliances with the houſe of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> have ſtill been glorious and uſeful, and all thoſe with <hi>France,</hi> unfortunate and prejudicial. 'Tis ever more dangerous to go out of the beaten Road, to travel through By-lanes, unknown, and dark untried Paths.</p>
               <p>You'l eaſily agree with me, that the Union of the <hi>United Provinces</hi> with <hi>France</hi> is the thing of all others which we ought the moſt to apprehend as fatal to our Crown: and therefore, by conſequence, nothing can be more ſafe for <hi>England</hi> than to diſunite them. Heaven furniſhes us now with an occaſion of doing that, which we ſhall never be able to recover again, ſhould it be neglected: and if we do ſuffer it to ſlip away, we ſhall bring that Republick into a neceſſity of tying this fatal Knot with <hi>France</hi> ſtronglier than ever it was faſtned before. This Union therefore above all others muſt be the Object of our Care, as it hath of late demonſtratively been the cauſe of our Misfortunes.</p>
               <p>I conclude then upon ſolid Foundations, without heſitating, That, in the firſt place, we muſt neceſſarily take part in this War, either with <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>France:</hi> and next, that we muſt not engage blind-fold, without taking right Meaſures with thoſe who have the ſame Intereſt that <hi>England</hi> hath in the Caſe: thirdly, that we muſt knit our Party firmly together, and get all the Advantages we can in this Treaty with <hi>Spain,</hi> as well as all the Security poſſible with other States; without yet exacting from <hi>Spain</hi> things which are intolerable unto them, whom the loſs of the <hi>Low Countries</hi> for fear of being reduced by the Exorbitancy of our Demands, may plunge into a neceſſity of according to whatever <hi>France</hi> ſhall require.</p>
               <p>This Diſcourſe being ended, I obſerved by their Countenances, that the two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who ſpake firſt applauded this Opinion, and that the third man was much ſhaken. They had ſome farther ſpeech together, but ſo ſoftly, that I cannot well collect the ſenſe of it: after which all the Company embraced, and gave one another their hand, with a reciprocal promiſe of ſecrecy, as well as an Union in the ſame Deſign. And thus they ſeparated each a ſeveral way, with evidence of great ſatisfaction and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And as ſoon as ever they were gone, I ſlipped back inſenſibly again into the former obſcurity near the Bed, without being ſeen by any of the Domeſticks. And thus whilſt theſe particulars were freſh in memory, I did ſet them down in Paper, and all that I could remember of their Diſcouſe only to ſatisfie my own Curioſity, and the Curiouſneſs of my Friends.</p>

            <head>OF THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS, OR Politick Conſtitution OF THIS KINGDOM.</head>
            <p>FUndamental Laws are not (or at leaſt need not be) any written Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment like Meer-ſtones between King and People, the King himſelf being a part (not party) in thoſe Laws, and the Commonwealth not being like a Corporation treated by Charter, but treating it ſelf. But the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Law or Laws is a ſettling of the Laws of Nature and Common Equity (by common conſent) in ſuch a form of Polity and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as that they may be adminiſtred amongſt us with honour and ſafety. For the firſt of which therefore, we are governed by a King: and for the ſecond, by a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to overſee and take order that that honourable truſt that is put into the hands of the King for the Dignity of the Kingdom, be rightly executed, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed to the alteration of the Politick Conſtitution taken up and approved, or to the deſtruction of that, for whoſe preſervation it was ordered and intended. <hi>A principal part of which honour, is that Royal Aſſent he is to give for the Enacting of ſuch good Laws as the People ſhall chooſe, for they are firſt to conſult their own ſafety and welfare, and then be who is to be intruſted with it, is to give an honourable Confirmation to it, and ſo to put an Impreſs of Majeſty and Royal Authority upon it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fundamental Laws then are not things of Capitulation between King and People, as if they were Foreigners and Strangers on to another, (nor ought they or any other Laws ſo to be, for then the King ſhould govern for himſelf, not for his People) but they are things of Conſtitution, treating ſuch a relation, and giving ſuch an Exiſtence and being by an external Polity to King and Subjects, as Head and Members, which Conſtitution in the very being of it is a Law held forth with more evidence, and written in the very heart of the Republick, far firmlier then can be by Pen and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and in which ſenſe we owe our Allegiance to the King as Head (not only by power, but influence) and ſo part of the Conſtitution, not as a party capitulating for a Prerogative againſt or contrary to it, which whoſoever ſeeks to ſet up, or ſide with, do break their Allegiance, and rebel againſt the State, going about to deprive the King of his juridical and lawful Authority, conferred upon him by the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of this State, under the pretence of inveſting him with an illegal and unconſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive Power, whereupon may follow this grand Inconvenience, The withdrawment of his Peoples Allegiance, which, as a Body connexed with the Head by the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of this Kingdom, is owing to him; his Perſon in relation to the Body, as the enlivening and quick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing Head thereof, being ſacred and taken notice of by the Laws in that capacity, and under that notion is made inviolate.</p>
            <p>And if it be conceived that Fundamental Laws muſt needs be only extant in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, this is the next way to bring all to confuſion, for then by the ſame Rule the King bids the Parliament produce thoſe Laws that fundamentally give them their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48501:16"/>priviledge and power, <hi>(Which by the way is not like the Power of inferiour Courts, that are Springs of the Parliament, dealing between Party and Party, but is anſwerable to their truſt, this Court being it ſelf Fundamental and Paramount, comprehending Law and Fquity, and being intruſted by the whole for the whole, is not therefore to be circumſcribed by any other Laws which have their being from it, not it from them, but only by that Law which at firſt gave its being,</hi> to wit, <hi>(Salus Populi).</hi> By the ſame Rule I ſay the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament may alſo intreat the King to produce thoſe Laws that Fundamentally give him his being, power and honour. Both which muſt therefore be determined, not by Laws, for they themſelves are Laws, yea the moſt ſupreme and fundamental Law, giving Laws to Laws themſelves, but by the received Conſtitution or Polity, which they themſelves are; and the end of their Conſtitution is the Law or Rule of their Power, to wit, An honourable and ſafe Regiment of the Common-wealth, which Two whoſoever goeth about to divide the one of them from the other, breaks the fundamental conſtitutive Law or Laws and Polity of this Kingdom, that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Man which we are to ſubmit unto; nor can or ought any Statute or written Law whatſoever, which is of latter Edition and inferiour Condition, being but an Off-ſpring of this Root, be interpreted or brought in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Plea, againſt this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary and radical Conſtitution, without Guilt of the higheſt Treaſon and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Enmity to the Publick-weal and Polity, becauſe by the very Conſtitution of this Kingdom, all Laws or interpretation of Laws tending to Confuſion or Diſſolution, are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> void. In this caſe we may allude and ſay, That the Covenant which was 400 Years before the Law, an after-Act cannot diſanul it.</p>
            <p>Ob. <hi>It may be objected, That this Diſcourſe ſeems to make our Government to be founded in Equity, not in Law, or upon that common rule of</hi> Salus Populi, <hi>which is alike common to all Nations, as well as any: And ſo what Difference?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Fundamental Laws of <hi>England</hi> are nothing but the Common Laws of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and Nature reduced into a particular way of Policy, which Policy is the ground of our Title to them, and intereſt in them: For though it is true, that Nature hath inveſted all Nations in an equal right to the Laws of Nature and Equity by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Bounty, without reſpect of Perſons, yet the ſeveral Models of external Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Policy renders them more or leſs capable of this their common Right: For though they have an equal Right in Nature to all the Laws of Nature and Equity, yet having fundamentally ſubjected themſelves by their Politick Conſtitutions unto a Regal Servitude, by Barbariſm or the like, they have thereby much diſabled and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted themſelves of that common Benefit. But on the contrary, where the outward Conſtitution or Polity of a Republick is purpoſely framed for the conſirming and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſerving this common Right of Nature and Equity (as in ours) there is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a common Right, but alſo a particular and lawful Power joyned with this Right for its Maintenance and Supportation. For whereas other People are without all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power, either of making Laws or raiſing Monies, both theſe Bodies of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy being in the arbitrary hands only of the Sovereign Magiſtrate amongſt many Nations, theſe with us are in the hands of the ſupreme Government, (not Governour) or Court of Judicature, to wit, the King and Parliament; here the People (like Free-men) give Money to the King, he doth not take it; and offers Laws to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, doth not receive them ſo: Now in ſuch a conſtituted Kingdom, where the very Conſtitution its ſelf is the fundamental Law of its own Preſervation, as is this mixt Regiment of ours, conſiſting of King and Parliament, as Head and Body, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending Monarchy, Ariſtocracy, and Democracy; there the fundamental Laws are like fundamental Truths in theſe two Properties: Firſt, they are comprehended in a very little room, to wit, Honour and Safety; and Secondly, they have their influence into all other inferiour Laws which are to be ſubjected to them, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent with them, as lawful Children and natural Branches.</p>
            <p>Ob. <hi>But in Proceſs of time there are many written Laws which ſeem at leaſt to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict this fundamental Conſtitution, and are not they binding notwithſtanding it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Conſtitution of this Kingdom which gave its being, and which is the radical and fundamental Law thereof, ought therefore to command in chief, for that it never yields up its Authority to thoſe inferiour Laws, which have their being from it, nor ought they which ſpring from it tend to the Deſtruction of it, but on the contrary it is to derive its radical Virtue and Influence into all ſucceeding Laws, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48501:17"/>they like Branches are to make the root flouriſh, from whence they ſpring, with exhibiting the lively and fructifying Virtue thereof, according to the Nature and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſucceeding times; things incident in after-ages not being able to be foreſeen, and particularly provided for at the beginning, ſaving in the fundamental Law of <hi>Salus Populi,</hi> politickly eſtabliſhed; nor can any Laws growing out of that root, bear any other Fruit, then ſuch as the nature thereof dictates; for, for a particular branch to ruine the whole Foundation by a ſeeming ſenſe contrary to it, or differing from it, is very abſurd; for then how can it be ſaid, Thou beareſt not the root, but the root thee? Laws muſt always reliſh of, and drink in the Conſtitution or Polity where they are made; and therefore with us, the Laws wherein the King is nominated. and ſo ſeems to put an abſolute Authority into his hands muſt never ſo be conſtrued, for that were with a breath to blow down all the Building at once; but the King is there comprehended and meant under a two-ſold Notion; Firſt, as truſted, being the Head, with that Power the Law confer'd upon him, for a Legal, and not an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Purpoſe, tending to an honourable Preſervation, not an unnatural Diſſolution. Secondly, as meaning him juridically, not abſtractly or perſonally, for ſo only the Law takes notice of the King as a juridical Perſon; for till the Legiſlative Power be abſolutely in the King, ſo that Laws come down from him to his People, and go not up from them to him, they muſt never be ſo interpreted: for as they have a juridical being and beginning, to wit, in Parliament, ſo muſt they have a ſuitable Execution and Adminiſtration, to wit, by the Courts, and legal Miniſters, under the Kings Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which according to the Conſtitution of this Kingdom, he can no more ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend for the good of his People, than the Courts can theirs; or if he do, to the publick hazard, then have the Courts this Advantage, that for publick Preſervation they may and muſt provide upon that Principle, <hi>The King can do no Wrong, neither in witholding Juſtice, nor Protection from his People.</hi> So that then <hi>Salus Populi</hi> being ſo principally reſpected and provided for, according to the nature of our Conſtitution and Polity, and ſo being <hi>Lex legum,</hi> or the Rule of all Laws branching thence, then if any Law do by Variation of Times, Violence of Tyranny, or Miſpriſion of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, vary there-from, it is a Baſtard and not a Son, and is by the lawful Parents either to be reduced or caſt out, as gendring unto Bondage and ruine of the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, by attempting to erect an abſolute and arbitrary Government. Nor can this equitable Expoſition of particular Statutes taken from the Scope of the politick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution be denyed without overthrow of juſt and legal Monarchy, (which ever tends to publick Good and Preſervation) and the ſetting up of an unjuſt and illegal Tyranny, ruling, if not without Law, yet by abuſed Laws, turning them as conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ordnance upon the People. The very Scripture it ſelf muſt borrow from its Scope and Principles for Explanation of particular Places, elſe it will be abuſed and (as it is through that Default) unto Hereſies. See we not how falſly Satan quoted true Scripture to Chriſt when he tempted him, only by urging the Letter without the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, or true Intention and Meaning? We are to know and do things <hi>Verum vere, juſtum juſte,</hi> elſe we neither judge with righteous Judgment, nor obey with juſt Obedience.</p>
            <p>Ob. <hi>But is not the Parliament guilty of exerciſing an arbitrary Power, if their Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings be not regulated by written Laws, but by</hi> Salus Populi?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> For the Parliament to be bound up by written Laws, is both deſtructive and abſurd.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is deſtructive, it being the Fundamental Court and Law, or the very <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Populi</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and ordained, as to make Laws, and ſee them executed, ſo to ſupply their Deficiency according to the preſent Exigency of things for publick Preſervation by the Prerogative of <hi>Salus Populi,</hi> which is univerſally in them, and but particularly in particular Laws and Statutes, which cannot provide againſt all future Exigents, which the Law of Parliaments doth, and therefore are not they to be limits to this. And it would yet be further deſtructive, by cutting the Parliament ſhort of half its Power at once, for it being a Court both of Law and Equity (as appears by the Power of making Laws, which is nothing but Equity reduced by common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent into Polity) when ever it is circumſcribed by written Laws, (which only is the Property of inferiour Courts) it ceaſeth to be ſupreme, and diveſts it ſelf of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent and uncircumſcribed Power which <hi>Salus Populi</hi> comprehends.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as it is deſtructive, ſo alſo it is abſurd; for the Legiſlative Power which gives Laws, is not to receive Laws, ſaving from the nature and end of its own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48501:17"/>which as they give it a being, ſo they endow it with Laws of Preſervation both of it ſelf and the whole, which it repreſents.</p>
            <p>I would not herein be miſ-underſtood, as if the Parliament, when as it only doth the Office of inferiour Courts, judging between Party and Party, were not limitted by writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Laws: there I grant it is, becauſe therein it only deals between <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum,</hi> which particular written Laws can and ought to determine: ſo that its ſuperlative and uncircumſcribed Power I intend only as relating to the Univerſe and the Affairs thereof, wherein it is to walk by its fundamental Principles, not by particular Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts or Statutes, which are made by the Parliament, between King and People, not between People and Parliament: they are ordained to be Rules of Government to the King, agreeing with the Liberty and Property of the People, and Rules of Obedience to the People without detainment of their Freedom by the Exerciſe of an illegal, uſurped and unconſented Power, whereunto Kings (eſpecially in here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Monarchies) are very prone, which cannot be ſuſpected by a Parliament, which is repreſentatively the Publick, intruſted for it, and which is like to partake and ſhare with the Publick, being but ſo many private Men put into Authority <hi>pro tempore,</hi> by common Conſent, for common Good.</p>
            <p>Nor is the Parliament hereby guilty of an arbitrary Government, or is it deſtructive to the Petition of Right, when as in providing for Publick-weal, it obſerves not the letter of the Law; Firſt, becauſe as aforeſaid, that Law was not made between Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and People, but by the People in Parliament between the King and them, as appears by the whole tenour of it, both in the complaining and praying parts, which wholly relate to the King. Secondly, becauſe of the common Conſent, that in the repreſentative Body (the Parliament) is given thereunto, wherein <hi>England</hi> in her Polity imitates Nature in her Inſtincts, who is wont to violate particular Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples for publick Preſervation, as when light things deſcend, and heavy aſcend, to prevent a <hi>Vacuum:</hi> And Thirdly, becauſe of the equitable Power which is inherent in a Parliament, and for publick Good is to be acted above and againſt any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Statute, or all of them: And Fourthly, becauſe the end of making that Law, to wit, the publick Preſervation, is fulfilled in the breaking of it, which is lawful in a Parliament that is choſen by the whole for the whole, and are themſelves alſo of the Body, though not in a King, for therein the Law ſaith, <hi>Better a miſchief than an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience.</hi> But it may be objected, Though it be not arbitrary for the Parliament to go againſt written Law, yet is it not ſo when they go againſt the Kings Conſent, which the Law, even the fundamental Law, ſuppoſeth in Parliamentary Proceedings; This hath been anſwered, That the King is juridically and according to the intention of the Law in his Courts, ſo that what the Parliament conſults for the publick Good, That by Oath, and the Duty of his Office, and Nature of this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity he is to conſent unto, and in caſe he do deny it, yet in the Conſtruction of the fundamental Law and Conſtitutions of this Kingdom, he is conceived to grant it, ſuppoſing the Head not be ſo unnatural to the Body that hath choſen it for good and not for evil.</p>
            <p>But it will be anſwered, Where is the Kings Negative Voice if the Parliament may proceed without his Conſent? I anſwer, That there is no known nor written Law that gives him any; and things of that nature are willingly believed till they be abuſed, or with too much Violence claimed. That his Majeſty hath fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally a Right of Conſent to the Enacting of Laws, is true, which (as aforeſaid) is part of that honourable Truſt conſtituted in him: And that this Royal Aſſent is an Act of Honour and not of Abſolute and Negative Power or Prerogative, appears by theſe following Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by his Oath at the Coronation mentioned in one of the Parliaments De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations where he doth or ſhould ſwear to confirm and grant all ſuch good Laws as his People <hi>ſhall chooſe</hi> to be obſerved, not <hi>hath choſen,</hi> for Firſt, The word <hi>concedis</hi> in that Oath were then unneceſſary, the Laws formerly Enacted being already grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by foregoing Kings, and ſo they need no more <hi>Conceſſion</hi> or Confirmation, elſe we muſt run upon this Shelf, that all our Laws die with the old King, and receive their being anew, by the new Kings Conſent. Secondly, hereby, the firſt and ſecond Clauſe in that Interrogatory, viz. <hi>Concedis juſtas leges &amp; permittas protegendas,</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and do but <hi>idem repetere;</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Quas Vulgus elegerit</hi> implies only the Act of the People in a disjunctive ſenſe from the Act or Conſent of the King, but Laws already made have more than <hi>Quas Vulgus elegerit,</hi> they have alſo the Royal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent too, ſo that that Phraſe cannot mean them wherein the Act or Conſent of the King is already involved.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:48501:18"/>
            <p>Secondly, by the Practiſe of requiring the Royal Aſſent even unto thoſe very Acts of Subſidies which are granted to himſelf and for his own uſe, which it is ſuppoſed he will accept of, and yet <hi>Honoris gratia</hi> is his Royal Aſſent craved and contributed thereunto.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by the Kings not ſitting in Parliament to debate and conſult Laws, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> are they at all offered him by the Parliament to conſider of, but to conſent to, which yet are tranſmitted from one Houſe to another, as well to conſult as conſent to, ſhewing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he hath no part in the conſultory part of them (for that it belongs only to the People in Parliament to diſcern and conſult their own good,) but he comes only at the time of Enacting, bringing his Royal Authority with him, as it were to ſet the Seal thereof to the Indenture already prepared by the People, for the King is Head of the Parliament in regard of his Authority, not in regard of his Reaſon or Judgment, as if it were to be oppoſed to the Reaſon or Judgment of both Houſes (which is the Reaſon both of King and Kingdom) and therefore do they as conſult, ſo alſo interpret Laws without him, ſuppoſing him to be a Perſon repleniſhed with Honour and Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority not skilled in Laws, nor to receive Information either of Law or Councel in Parliamentary Affairs from any, ſaving from that ſupreme Court and higheſt Councel of the King and Kingdom, which admits no counterpoiſe, being intruſted both as the wiſeſt Counſel and juſteſt Judicature.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, either the choiſe of the People in Parliament is to be the Ground and Rule of the Kings Aſſent, or nothing but his Pleaſure, and ſo all Bills tho' never ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for publick Good and Preſervation, and after never ſo much pains and conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of both Houſes, may be rejected, and ſo they made meer Cyphers, and we brought to that paſs, as neither to have no Laws, or ſuch only as come immediately from the King (who oft is a man of Pleaſure, and little ſeen in publick Affairs, to be able to judge) and ſo the Kingdoms great Councel muſt be ſubordinated either to his meer Will, and then what Difference between a free Monarchy, and an abſolute, ſaving that the one rules without Councel, and the other againſt it, or at the beſt but to a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet Councel conſiſting commonly of Men of private Intereſts, but certainly of no publick Truſt.</p>
            <p>Ob. <hi>But if the King muſt conſent to ſuch Laws as the Parliament ſhall chuſe</hi> eo nomine, <hi>they may then propound unreaſonable things to him, as to conſent to his own Depoſing, or to the leſſening his own Revenue,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> So that the iſſue is, whether it be fitter to truſt the Wiſdom and Integrity of our Parliament, or the Will and Pleaſure of the King in this caſe of ſo great and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Concernment. In a word, the King being made the Fountain of Juſtice and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection to his People by the fundamental Laws or Conſtitution of this Kingdom, he is therefore to give life to ſuch Acts and Things as tend thereunto, which Acts depend not upon his Pleaſure, but though they are to receive their greater Vigour from him, yet are they not to be ſuſpended at pleaſure by him, for that which at firſt was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Kingdom, for an honourable way of Subſiſtence and Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt not be wreſted contrrry to the nature of this Polity, (which is a free and mist Monarchy and not abſolute) to its Deſtruction and Confuſion, ſo that in caſe the King in his Perſon ſhould decline his Duty, the King in his Courts is bound to perform it, where his Authority properly reſides, for if he refuſe that Honour which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick by its fundamental Conſtitution hath conferred upon him, and will not put forth the Acts of it, for the end it was given him, <hi>viz.</hi> for the Juſtice and Safety of his People, this hinders not but that they who have as fundamentally reſerved a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of being and well-being in their own hands by the Concurrence of Parliamentary Authority to the Royal Dignity, may thereby provide for their own Subſiſtence, wherein is acted the Kings juridical Authority though his perſonal pleaſure be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, for his legal and juridical Power is included and ſuppoſed in the very being, and conſequently in the Acts of Courts of Juſtice, whoſe being he may as well ſuſpend as their Power of Acting, for that without this is but a Cypher, and therefore neither their being nor their acting ſo depend upon him, as not to be able to act and execute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Juſtice and Protection without him, in caſe he deny to act with them, and yet both ſo depend upon him, as that he is bound both in Duty and Honour, by the Conſtitution of this Polity to act in them and they for him, ſo that (according to that Axiom in Law) <hi>The King can do no wrong,</hi> becauſe his juridical Power and Authority is always to controle his perſonal Miſcarriages.</p>

                  <hi>The Report of Sir</hi> Robert Brook, <hi>Chair-man to the Committee that was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Houſe of Commons to Enquire into the Firing of the City of</hi> London; <hi>made the Two and Twentieth of</hi> January, 1666.</head>
               <p>IN a Letter from <hi>Alanſen</hi> of the 23 of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1666, <hi>New Stile,</hi> written from one <hi>Dural</hi> to a Gentleman lodging in the Houſe of one of the Miniſters of the <hi>French</hi> Church in <hi>London,</hi> called <hi>Monſieur Herault,</hi> there were theſe Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Pray acquaint me with the truth of certain News which is common in this Countrey, That a <hi>Fire from Heaven</hi> is fallen upon a City called <hi>Belke,</hi> ſituated on the ſide of the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> where a World of People have been killed and burnt, and Houſes alſo conſumed.</q> Which ſeemed a word of <hi>Cabal,</hi> caſt out by ſome that were knowing, and others that might be ignorant of the ſignification of it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth Styles,</hi> informs, That in <hi>April</hi> laſt, in an eager Diſcourſe ſhe had with a <hi>French</hi> Servant of Sir <hi>Vere Fan,</hi> he haſtily replyd'd, <hi>You Engliſh Maids will like the</hi> Frenchmen <hi>better, when there is not a Houſe left between</hi> Temple-Bar <hi>and</hi> London-Bridge. To which ſhe anſwered, <hi>I hope your Eyes will never ſee that.</hi> He replyed, <hi>This will come to paſs between</hi> June <hi>and</hi> October.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Tiſdale</hi> informs, That he being about the beginning of <hi>July</hi> at the <hi>Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound</hi> in St. <hi>Martins,</hi> with one <hi>Fitz Harris</hi> an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſt, heard him ſay, <hi>There would be a ſad Deſolation in</hi> September, <hi>in</hi> November <hi>a worſe, in</hi> December <hi>all would be united into one.</hi> Whereupon he asked him, where this Deſolation would be? He anſwered, <hi>In London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Ratcliff,</hi> having ſome Diſcourſe with Mr. <hi>Lanhorn</hi> of the <hi>Middle-Temple,</hi> Bariſter, (reputed a zealous Papiſt) about <hi>February</hi> 15 laſt, after ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in Diſputation about Religion, he took him by the hand, and ſaid to him, <hi>You expect great things in Sixty Six, and think that</hi> Rome <hi>will be deſtroyed, but what if it be</hi> London?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Kitely</hi> of <hi>Barkin</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> informs, That one Mrs. <hi>Yazly,</hi> a Papiſt, of <hi>Ilford</hi> in the ſaid County, came unto his Houſe, <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 13th. and being in Diſcourſe with his Mother, ſaid, <hi>They ſay the next</hi> Thurſday <hi>will be the hotteſt Day that ever was in</hi> England. She replyed, <hi>I hope the hotteſt ſeaſon of the Year is now paſt.</hi> To which ſhe anſwered, <hi>I know not whether it be the hotteſt for Weather or for Action.</hi> This Mrs. <hi>Yazly</hi> coming to the ſame Houſe the Week after the Fire, Mr. <hi>Kitely</hi> ſaid to her with ſome trouble, I have often thought of your <hi>Hot Thurſday:</hi> to which ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, <hi>It was not indeed upon the</hi> Thurſday, <hi>but it happened upon the</hi> Sunday <hi>was ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night after.</hi> Mrs. <hi>Yazly</hi> hearing this Evidence produced againſt her, endeavoured to avoid the Words, ſaying, <hi>That upon the 13th of</hi> Auguſt <hi>ſhe did tell Mrs.</hi> Kitely, <hi>That they ſay the next</hi> Thurſday <hi>will be the darkeſt</hi> Thurſday <hi>that ever was in</hi> England, but not otherwiſe; which ſhe affirms to have received from one <hi>Finchman,</hi> an old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Ilford;</hi> who being examined by a Juſtice of Peace to diſcover the truth thereof, denied that ever ſhe ſaid any ſuch words to Mrs. <hi>Yazly,</hi> or that ſhe had diſcourſed with her about any ſuch Matter; and as to the ſubſequent Words, ſhe ſaith Mrs. <hi>Yazly</hi> denies ever to have ſpoken them: But Mr. <hi>Kitely</hi> offered in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence (if it ſhould be demanded) to bring his Mother and Wife to teſtifie the ſame.</p>

                  <hi>William Ducket</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> a Member of the Houſe, informs, That one <hi>Henry Baker</hi> of <hi>Chippenham</hi> in the County of <hi>Wilts,</hi> coming from Market with one <hi>John Woodman</hi> of <hi>Kelloway</hi> in the ſame County, the Thurſday before the Fire began in <hi>London,</hi> they had ſome Diſcourſe about the Buying of a Yoke of Fat Bullocks, wherein they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, becauſe <hi>Woodman</hi> who was to Sell them was deſired to keep them a while in his hands; But the ſaid <hi>Woodman</hi> denied ſo to do, for that as he alledged, he could not ſtay in the Country till that time which <hi>Baker</hi> would have them delivered to him in, and being asked whether he was a going, he refuſed to tell, asking what he had to do to make that Queſtion: Put riding a little further, the ſaid <hi>Woman</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48501:20"/>theſe Words, <hi>You have brave Blades at</hi> Chippenham, <hi>you made Bonefires lately for beating the</hi> Dutch; <hi>but ſince you delight in Bonefires, you ſhall have your Bellies full of them ere it be long:</hi> Adding, <hi>That if he lived one Week longer, he ſhould ſee</hi> London <hi>as ſad a</hi> London, <hi>as ever it was ſince the World began; and in ſome ſhort time after, he ſhould ſee as bloudy a time as ever was, ſince</hi> England <hi>was</hi> England. This Diſcourſe was not much taken notice of at that time it was ſpoken; but when the City of <hi>London</hi> was burnt, the ſaid <hi>Henry Baker</hi> gave this Information to the ſaid Mr. <hi>Ducket;</hi> and whereupon he iſſued out his Warrant to apprehend <hi>Woodman,</hi> but he was gone out of the Country, and cannot be heard of ſince.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Robert Hubert</hi> of <hi>Roan</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> who acknowledged that he was one of thoſe that fired the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Farryner</hi> a Baker in <hi>Pudding-Lane,</hi> from whence the Fire had its beginning, confeſſed that he came out of <hi>France</hi> with one <hi>Stephen Peidloe</hi> about four Months before the Fire, and went into <hi>Sweden</hi> with him, where he alſo ſtaid with him as his Companion four Months, and then they came together into <hi>England</hi> in a <hi>Swediſh</hi> Ship called the <hi>Skipper,</hi> where he ſtaid on Board with the ſaid <hi>Peidloe</hi> till that <hi>Saturday</hi> Night in which the Fire brake out. When <hi>Peidloe</hi> taking him out of the Ship, carried him into <hi>Pudding-lane,</hi> and he being earneſt to know whither he would carry him, he would not ſatisfie him till he had brought him to the place, and then he told him, that he had brought three Balls, and gave him one of them to throw into the Houſe. And he would have been further ſatisfied in the Deſign, as he ſaid, before he would execute it: But <hi>Peidloe</hi> was ſo impatient that he would not hear him, and then he did the Fact; which was, That he put a Fire-ball at the end of a long Pole, and lighting it with a piece of Match, he put it in at a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and ſtaid till he ſaw the Houſe in a Flame. He confeſſed that there were Three and twenty Complices, whereof <hi>Piedloe</hi> was the Chief.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Graves</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Merchant living in St. <hi>Mary Axe,</hi> informed this Committee, that he had known <hi>Hubert</hi> ever ſince he was four Years old, and hath ever obſerved him to be a Perſon of a miſchievous Inclination, and therefore fit for any villanous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize; and becauſe of his Knowledge he had of him, he went to viſit him in Priſon, where when he ſaw him, he could not but commiſerate the Condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into he had brought himſelf. And for his better Diſcovery of the Fact, he told him, the ſaid <hi>Hubert,</hi> that he did not believe he had done that of which he confeſſed himſelf guilty. So which <hi>Hubert</hi> replyed, <hi>Yes Sir, I am guilty of it, and have been brought to it, by the inſtigation of Monſieur</hi> Peidloe; <hi>but not out of any malice to the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Nation, but from a deſire of Reward which he promiſed me upon my Return into</hi> France.</p>
               <p>It is obſervable, That this miſerable Creature who confeſſed himſelf to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, to be a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> was a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and died ſo. And as for the aforeſaid <hi>Peidloe,</hi> the ſaid Mr. <hi>Graves</hi> informed, that he had had a full knowledge of him, and knew him to a very Deboiſt Perſon, and apt to any wicked Deſign. Moreover for a clear Conviction of the Guilt of the aforeſaid <hi>Hubert,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lowman,</hi> the Keeper of the <hi>White-Lion</hi> Priſon, was appointed to ſet him upon a Horſe, and to go with him, and ſee if he could find out the place where he threw the <hi>Fire-Ball.</hi> Upon which, <hi>Hubert</hi> with more readineſs than they that were well acquainted with the place, went to <hi>Pudding-Lane,</hi> unto the very place where the Houſe that was firſt fired, ſtood, ſaying, <hi>Here ſtood the Houſe.</hi> The Jaylor endeavoured to draw him from that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and putting him upon ſeeking another place; but he poſitively perſiſted in what he had firſt ſaid; and affirmed that to have been the ſaid Houſe. It being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated to the Committee, That notwithſtanding the Confeſſion of the ſaid <hi>Hubert,</hi> it was confidently reported, the Fire in the forementioned <hi>Farryners</hi> Houſe, began by Accident. The Committee therefore ſent for him the ſaid <hi>Farryner</hi> before them, who being examined, ſaid, That it was impoſſible any Fire ſhould happen in his Houſe by Accident: For he had after Twelve of the Clock that Night gone through every Room thereof, and found no Fire but in one Chimney, where the Room was paved with Bricks, which Fire he diligently raked up in Embers. He was then ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Whether no Window or Door might let in Wind to diſturb thoſe Coals? He affirmed there was no poſſibility for any Wind to diſturb them; and that it was abſolutely ſet on fire of Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dawes Weymanſel</hi> Eſquire, one of His Majeſties Juſtices of the Peace, Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, That he ſaw a Man apprehended in the Time of the Fire, near the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:48501:20"/>with his Pockets ſtufit with <hi>Combuſtible Matter,</hi> made of Flax, Tow, and ſuch like Materials.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>John Packer</hi> informs, That he ſaw a Perſon in the time of the Fire, throw ſome <hi>Combuſtible Matter</hi> into a Shop in the <hi>Old Bailey,</hi> which he thinks was the Shop of an Apothecary; and that immediately thereupon he ſaw a great ſmoak, and ſmelt a ſmell of <hi>Brimſtone,</hi> The Perſon that did this, immediately run away; but upon the out-cry of the People he was taken by the Guards.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Randal,</hi> Mr. <hi>Haſlam,</hi> Mr. <hi>Humphrey Bowyer,</hi> do all agree, That they ſaw a Perſon flinging ſomething into a Houſe near St. <hi>Antholins</hi> Church; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Houſe was on fire, and the ſmoak thereof infeſted the adjacent Houſes. And when this was done, there was <hi>No fire near the place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Michael March,</hi> an Officer in the Trained Bands in a Company of Sir <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard Browns</hi>'s apprehended a <hi>Walloon</hi> in the time of the Fire, at the Nags-head in <hi>Leaden-hall Street,</hi> with an Inſtrument like a Dark-Lanthorn, made (as is conceived) to lay a Train of Powder, and it was filled with Gun-powder. There were two more of the ſame Nation in his Company. They being asked to what uſe they employed the ſame Inſtrument, would give no Account thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Newton Killingworth</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> informed, That he apprehended a Perſon during the Fire, about whom he found much <hi>Combuſtible Matter,</hi> and certain <hi>black things, of a long figure,</hi> which he could not indure to hold in his hand, by reaſon of their extream heat. This Perſon was ſo ſurprized at firſt, that he would not anſwer to any Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but being on his way to <hi>White-hall,</hi> he acted the part of a Mad-man, and ſo continued while he was with him.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>John Maynard</hi> a Member of this Houſe affirms, That he had ſome of that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible Matter</hi> in his hands; and though it were in its natural Subſtance, and unfired, yet the heat of it was ſcarcely to be endured by the touch.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Freeman</hi> of <hi>Southwark</hi> Brewer, (whoſe Houſe was lately fired) informs, That on the Day his Houſe was fired (about a quarter of an hour before that happened) a Paper with a Ball of Wild-fire, containing near a pound weight wrapt in it, was found in the <hi>Nave of a Wheel,</hi> in a Wheelers Yard, where lay a great quantity of Timber. How his Houſe was fired, he knoweth not; but this he affirmed to the Committee, that it could not be by Accident, becauſe there had not been any Candle or Fire in the Houſe where the Hay lay, that whole day; and that the Hay being laid in very dry, and before <hi>Midſummer,</hi> could not poſſibly be ſet on Fire within it ſelf. Moreover he ſaid, that the Hay-loſt was on Fire on the top of the Houſe, and that the Fire ſpread from the one end of the Roof to another in an inſtant.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Richard Harwood</hi> informs, That being near the <hi>Feathers Tavern</hi> by St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> upon the Fourth of <hi>September,</hi> he ſaw ſomething through a grate in a Cellar, like Wild-fire; by the ſparkling and ſpitting of it, he could judge it to be no other; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he gave notice of it, to ſome Souldiers that were near the place, who cauſed it to be quenched.</p>
               <p>I had order from the Committee to acquaint you, that we traced ſeveral Perſons upon ſtrong Suſpicion (during the Fire) to the Guards, but could not make further Diſcovery of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus far was the Report.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What follows was given into the Committee, but not by them reported to the Houſe at that time</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN Obedience to an Order directed to me, from the Honourable Committee of the Houſe of Commons, then ſitting in the Speaker's Chamber, on the Second of <hi>October,</hi> 1666. I did carry <hi>Robert Hubert</hi> to St. <hi>Katherines</hi> Tower by Water, to let me know the place where the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Ship lay, that brought him and other <hi>French</hi>-men from <hi>Stockholm,</hi> and he brought me to the Dock over againſt Mr. <hi>Corſellis</hi> his Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and did then verifie to me and Mr. <hi>Corſellis,</hi> that the Ship lay there, until ſuch time as he with Mr. <hi>Peidloe</hi> and others did go and ſet Fire to a Houſe. And this <hi>Hubert</hi> did then further ſay, That Mr. <hi>Peidloe</hi> did fix two Fire-balls to a long Pole, and put them

But with all the inquiry and diligence that I could uſe, I could neither find nor hear of any ſuch Veſſel. And from thence I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the ſaid <hi>Robert Hubert</hi> to <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> and did then deſire him to ſhew me the Houſe that they did fire, and he ſaid that it was near the Bridge.

So I went to <hi>Robert Hubert,</hi> and ſtood by him, and turned my Back towards the Bakers Houſe, and demanded of him which Houſe it was that he fired, (directing to other Houſes contrary to that houſe) but he turning himſelf about, ſaid, <hi>This was the houſe</hi> (pointing to the Bakers Houſe) <hi>that was firſt fired.</hi> Then by reaſon of his Lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I ſet him on a Horſe, and carried him to ſeveral other places, but no other place he would acknowledge; but rode back again to the Bakers Houſe, and ſaid again, <hi>That was the Houſe</hi> (pointing at the Bakrs-houſe.) And this I do humbly certifie to this Honourable Committee.</p>

He
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48501:22"/>asked him, what Commiſſion he had for ſo doing? He anſwered, That his Comiſſion was in his Conſtancy.

               <p>A Citizen being fired out of his Houſe, had hired a Lodging in <hi>Queen ſtreet</hi> in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Garden;</hi> and going up <hi>Holborn,</hi> there being a Crowd of People, ſteps in amongſt them, and hears a Woman ſay, that ſhe had a hand in firing the City.

The Citizen enquired for a Conſtable: The People re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, There was one gone for. But a Gallant comes, and takes her by the Arm, and leads her away: ſaying, He would have her examined: And forthwith, another Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant cloſeth with him; and they both carried her to the <hi>Griffin</hi>-Tavern in <hi>Holbourn.</hi> The Citizen follows them, to ſee the Reſult of the Buſineſs: But they with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the houſe, ſhut out the Company (all but the Citizen, ſuppoſing him to be one of their own Company,) but asking one the other concerning him, and finding him not of them, put him out again. Whereupon, he goes to the next Company of Souldiers, and enquires for their Captain: who replyed, He was not there; but told him, <hi>Yonder is my L. C.</hi> Unto whom the Citizen repaired; and acquainted his Lordſhip, That there was a Woman apprehended (and reſcued by a couple of Gallants) that had confeſſed ſhe had a hand in burning the City, and was at ſuch a Tavern. Whereupon the <hi>L. C.</hi> called to a Captain in the Street, and ordered him to go with that Man, and apprehend the Woman that he ſhould direct him to. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, he goes with the Citizen, and takes her, with the firſt Gallant, who ſtood up highly in her defence, and carries them both to an Ale-houſe on the other ſide of the way. The Citizen perceiving that nothing would be done with her, leaves his Name with the Captain, and where he might be found; but was never called for, to juſtifie the Words ſpoken by her.</p>
               <p>A Woman ſtanding in <hi>White-Chappel</hi> with a Company about her, was ask'd what the matter was? She ſaid, that ſhe met two young Men in that place, and asked them how it was with the Fire: They anſwered <hi>'Tis now almoſt out, if it can be kept ſo; but the Rogues renew it with their Fire-balls.</hi> As ſaith another Woman, <hi>Young men if you have a heart to it, you may be hired to throw them.</hi> It was ask'd her, What was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the Woman that ſpake thus? She anſwered, That ſhe had apprehended her, and delivered her to the under Beadle of <hi>White-Chappel</hi> Pariſh. The Woman falling under the Accuſation (not being able to deny it) there being many Witneſſes at that time that heard it: She was delivered to Sir <hi>John Robinſon</hi> but heard of no more.</p>

                  <hi>Concerning an Houſe-keeper at</hi> So-ho, <hi>who fired his own Dwelling-houſe.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FIrſt he ſecured all his Goods in his Garden, and then went in and fired his Houſe; which when he had done, he endeavoured to get away out at his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door. A Neighbour demanded of him, Who had fired his Houſe? He anſwered, <hi>The Devil.</hi> Upon that, his Neighbour bad him ſtand, or he would run his Halbert into his Guts. His anſwer was, <hi>If you do, there are enough left behind me to do the Work.</hi> Whereupon, he was ſecur'd, and a Bill of Indictment brought againſt him, and about three Witneſſes did ſwear to it: And his Son came in as Witneſs againſt him; who was demanded by the Foreman, What he could ſay as to the firing of his Father's Houſe? He ſaid, That his Father did fire it with a Fire-ball. It was demanded of him, Whether he did fire it above ſtairs, or below? He anſwered, <hi>Above ſtairs.</hi> The Bill was likewiſe found, but the Petty-jury did not find him guilty.</p>
               <p>A Maid was taken in the Street, with two Fire-balls in her Lap: Some did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of her, Where ſhe had them? She ſaid, One of the King's Life-guard threw them into her Lap. She was asked, Why ſhe had not cauſed him to be apprehended? She ſaid, That ſhe knew not what they were. She was indicted for this, and the Bill found againſt her, and turned over to the <hi>Old Baily;</hi> but no Proſecution upon it.</p>
               <p>In the time of the Fire, a Conſtable took a <hi>French</hi>-man firing an houſe, ſeized on him; and going to a Magiſtrate with him, met his R. H. the D. <hi>Y.</hi> who asked the Reaſon of the Tumult. One told him, that a <hi>French</hi>-man was taken firing a Houſe: His H. called for the Man, who ſpake to him in <hi>French:</hi> The D. asked, Who would atteſt it? The Conſtable ſaid, <hi>I took him in the Act, and I will atteſt it.</hi> The D. took him into his Cuſtody, and ſaid, <hi>I will ſecure him.</hi> But he was heard of no more.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> the third of <hi>September,</hi> there was a <hi>French</hi>-man taken firing a houſe; and upon ſearching of him, Fire-balls were found about him. At which time four of the Life-Guard reſcued the <hi>French</hi>-man, and took him away from the People, after their uſual manner in the whole time of the Fire.</p>
               <p>One Mr. <hi>Belland,</hi> a <hi>French</hi>-man, living at <hi>Maribone,</hi> who bought great ſtore of Paſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board for a conſiderable time before the Fire of the City of <hi>London,</hi> to the Quantity of twenty groſs in one Shop, and much more elſewhere, was asked by a Citizen, What he did with all that Paſt-board? He anſwered that he made Fire-works for the King's Pleaſure. The Citizen asked him. <hi>What doth the King give you?</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48501:23"/>
                  <hi>Nothing, only I have reſpect at Court:</hi> The Citizen ſaid, <hi>Take heed, Mr.</hi> Belland, <hi>you do not expend your Eſtate, and then loſe your Reſpect at Court, for you are at a great Charge. Belland</hi> anſwered, <hi>Sir, do you think this a great matter? I uſe all this my ſelf; But if you did ſee all the great quantities I have made elſewhere in three ſeveral places, three, four, and five miles off, you would ſay ſomething.</hi> Another time the Stationer with whom he dealt for the Paſt-board, being at his houſe in <hi>Maribone,</hi> and wondring at the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Thouſands of Fire-works, that lay piled up of ſeveral ſorts, he ſaid, <hi>Sir, do you wonder at this? If you ſhould ſee the quantity that I have made elſewhere by other Men, you would wonder indeed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Sunday before the Fire began, this <hi>Belland</hi> came to the Shop where he was wont to buy his Paſt-board, but the Stationer being not there, he deſired a Citizen (the Stationers's Neighbour) to ſpeak to him, and to let him know that he had much wronged him in diſappointing him of the four Groſs of Paſt-board which he ſhould have had of him, and ſaid that he ſhould not do his work by the time; and that if he had it not by <hi>Tueſday</hi> night, it would come too late, he ſhould have no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for it after that (which was the <hi>Tueſday</hi> Night before the Fire) <hi>Mr.</hi> Belland, (ſaid the Citizen) <hi>What is the reaſon of your haſte? Have you any Shew ſuddenly before the King?</hi> At which he bluſh'd, and would give no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſwer. Says the Citizen, <hi>What kind of Fire-works do you make? only ſuch as will crack and run? Belland</hi> anſwered, <hi>I make of all ſorts? ſome that will burn and make no crack at all, but will fly up in a pure body of Flame, higher then the top of</hi> Paul<hi>'s, and waver in the air,</hi> Says the Citizen, <hi>Mr.</hi> Belland, <hi>when you make your Shew, ſhall I ſee it? Yes,</hi> ſaid Belland, <hi>I promiſe you,</hi> and gave his hand upon it. Which Citizen in the time of the Fire being upon the <hi>Thames</hi> in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And after the burning of the City, ſome Citizen agreed to go to <hi>Maribone,</hi> to ſpeak with this <hi>Belland;</hi> and by the way, met with his two Maids and his Boy; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome knowledge of them, asked for young Mr. <hi>Belland:</hi> who told them, he was not at home, neither knew they where he was. But the Citizens obſerving, that they carried with them Rabbets and Capons ready dreſs'd, concluded they were going to him, and told them ſo, whereat they were ſurly, and bade them go look him, for they would not tell them where he was. Upon that, the Citizens reſolved to follow them, and did, till they came to <hi>Whitehall.</hi> The ſervants went up Stairs, and down ſtairs, on purpoſe to have loſt them, but could not, for they kept cloſe to them: And at laſt, one of the Maids went to a Door, and knocked; crying out, They were dogged by two Men, that they could not be rid of. With that, young Mr. <hi>Belland</hi> opened the Door, ſaying to one of the Citizens, <hi>Sir, your Servant: How do you do?</hi> One of them anſwered, <hi>Both I, and many thouſand Families more, are the worſe for you; for you, under pretence of making Fire-works for the King, have deſtroy'd a famous City, and ruined a noble People.</hi> To which <hi>Belland</hi> replies, <hi>I make nothing but innocent things, that will do no harm; for which I have a Patent from the King.</hi> But the Citizen anſwered, <hi>If the King gave you a Patent, it was but for your ſelf.</hi> Who anſwered, <hi>No.</hi> Said the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen, <hi>What made you then to employ ſo many Men, in ſo many Places? No,</hi> ſaid <hi>Belland, I ſet no man to work; neither know I any Man that makes of them, but my ſelf;</hi> tho' he had often before ſaid otherwiſe. While they were thus diſcourſing, old <hi>Belland</hi> looks from under the Hangings; <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I hear you charge my Son with Suſpition of burning the City; I pray you, ſpeak lower,</hi> (caſting his eyes about, fearing the Ladies, paſſing by, might hear;) and ſaid, <hi>My Son doth nothing, but what he hath a Patent from the King for; and ſhall have an Order to ſue any Man, that ſhall accuſe him.</hi> And he ſaid, <hi>My Son is no Priſoner, but lodged here, to prevent him from the rage of the Common People. Well,</hi> ſaid the Citizen, <hi>You muſt give an Account for what you have done:</hi> And ſo they ſhut the Door upon them. The Citizen went, and enquired whoſe Lodgings they were; and were told, they belonged to a Lady.</p>

                  <hi>The Information of</hi> Thomas Middleton <hi>Chyrurgeon, late Inhabitant of St.</hi> Brides, London.</head>
               <p>I The ſaid <hi>Thomas Middleton</hi> do hereby certifie. That upon the <hi>Sunday</hi> in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon (the Day wherein the dreadful Fire brake out in <hi>Pudding-Lane,</hi> which conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the City) hearing the general Out-cry, that the City was fired by <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> I repair'd to the top of a Church-ſteeple, near the <hi>Three Cranes,</hi> in the <hi>Vintrey;</hi> where my ſelf, and ſeveral others, obſerv'd the Motion of the Fire for two or three Hours together: And we all took Notice, that the Fire did break forth out of ſeveral Houſes, when the Houſes which were then burning were at a good diſtance from them every way. And, more particularly, I ſaw the Fire break out from the inſide of <hi>Lawrence Poultney</hi>-ſteeple, when there was no Fire near it. Theſe, and ſuch like obſervations begat in me a Perſwaſion, that the Fire was maintained by Deſign. Upon <hi>Monday,</hi> I repaired again into the City, and found, as the Day before, that the Fire did break forth in freſh Houſes, at a great diſtance one from another. And as I was returning home, paſſing through <hi>Watling-ſtreet,</hi> by a Tobacco Merchant's Houſe, I ſaw the Maſter of the Houſe come down Stairs, driving a young Fellow before him; ſaying to him, <hi>You Rogue, do you come to rob me? What did you do in my Garret?</hi> Or Words to that purpoſe; and puſht him out of doors: All which I obſerv'd, and he ſeemed to be a <hi>Trench</hi>-man: He was a ſhort, black Fellow, of about Two and twenty Years o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whereupon I ſearch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He had alſo about him a Book intituled, <hi>The Jewiſh Government.</hi> I charged him that he was a <hi>French</hi>-man, becauſe he ſpake broken <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but he denied it, and did much vaunt himſelf. There coming a Conſtable by with his Staff, I required him to carry him to Priſon, and I would aſſiſt him: So we conveyed him to <hi>Old-Bridewel;</hi> and by the way, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ready to kill him; calling him <hi>French</hi>-Raſcal. I prayed them to forbear, for Juſtice would give him Reward. I told the Fellow, he would be hang'd; he made ſlight of it, ſaying, <hi>If I die, my Soul ſhall be ſaved, but yours ſhall be damned.</hi> And when he was put into <hi>Bridewel,</hi> I deſired that he might be ſecured, and none ſunered to ſpeak with him, till he were examined before a Magiſtrate, becauſe the Tobacco Merchants houſe was preſently burned upon it. But ſo it happened on the next Day, that the fire came on, and conſumed my Houſe and Goods; ſo that I was forced, with my Family, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And underſtanding that the Parliament hath appointed a Committee to enquire after the Actors in, and Fomentors of that terrible Fire; I thought good to inform the Honourable Committee thereof, that they may ſend for the Keeper of the ſaid <hi>Bridewel,</hi> to know what became of the Fellow, that he might receive Juſtice according to his Demerit. Thus much I thought my ſelf obliged to do, as in Duty bound to God and my Country; all which I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to affirm upon Oath, when I ſhall be thereunto called.</p>

               <p>IN the time of the Fire, near <hi>Bridewell,</hi> there was a Man ſadly bemoaning the great loſs he was like to ſuſtain (the Fire then being within Five or ſix Houſes of him) did beſeech the People for God's ſake (they having no Goods of their own in danger) to come in and help him to throw out Trunks, Cheſts, Beds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> out at a Window, having procured two Carts or Waggons to carry them away. Whereupon I ran in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Houſe with ſeveral others, broke down his Windows, threw out his Goods, and loaded the Carts; and there being ſome Interval of time before the return of the Carts, and ſeeing a Room wherein were many Books and looſe Papers (which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a Library) I went in and took down a Book, which proved to be <hi>Ovid</hi>'s <hi>Metamorphoſis;</hi> and while I was looking upon it, there came into the ſame Room an old Man of low ſtature, with a white Frock, who looked alſo on the Book as it was in my Hand; I took him in my mind to be ſome Groom come out of a Stable,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48501:24"/>and thought him to be preſumptuouſly fooliſh, ſuppoſing ſuch a mean-like old Man ignorant of that Language in which the Book was written, it being <hi>Latin;</hi> but I ſpoke not to him. In the mean time there brake forth a Fire amongſt the Papers which were behind us, there being none in the Room but he and I. Whereupon the reſt of the People coming in, cri'd out, <hi>We had ſet the Room on Fire:</hi> And ruſhing in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, put out the Fire with their Feet. Whereupon I took hold of the old Man by the Buttons under the Throat, and ſaid, <hi>How now, Father! it muſt either be you or I that muſt fire theſe Papers.</hi> There was a ſmall thing of a black matter, which looked like a piece of Link, burning, which queſtionleſs ſet fire on the Papers, but it was immediately trod out. A Tumult of People thronged in; and when I ſaid, <hi>How now, Father!</hi> and took hold on him, <hi>Parce mihi, Domini:</hi> The People which did not underſtand it, cried out, He is a <hi>French</hi>-man, kill him; and with pulling of him, his Peruke fell off; then appeared a bald Skull, and under his Frock he had black Cloaths, I think of Biſhop-Sattin; whereupon he ſeemed to be a grave Eccleſiaſtick Perſon. I had much ado to ſave him from the People, but at laſt bronght him before the D. of <hi>Y.</hi> We found it his Pockets a Bundle of Papers cloſed up with Wax like a Packet, which was delivered to the D. of <hi>Y.</hi> I know not what was written in them, neither do I know what Country-man he was; but methoughts he looked ſomething Jeſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. This I am certain of, that when I went into the Room there was no Fire in it, and it was fired when there was none but he and I in it, yet I cannot ſay I ſaw him do it, though I cannot but ſuſpect he did it, and the rather becauſe there were ſeveral Houſes untouched betwixt this Houſe, and where the Fire was coming on, where the Papers in the Library were thus on Fire as I have related. What became of this Fellow, after we had delivered him to his R. H. I have not heard.</p>

                  <p>NOt long after the Burning of <hi>London,</hi> Mr. <hi>Brook Bridges,</hi> a young gentleman of the <hi>Temple,</hi> as he was going to attend Divine Service in the <hi>Temple</hi>-Church, in a Pew there, found this following Paper; which immediately, either by himſelf, or a Relation of his, was delivered to Sir <hi>William Morrice,</hi> one of his Majeſties Principal Secretaries of State: The Contents of the Paper are as follows.</p>
               </argument>
               <head>
                  <hi>A Warning to</hi> Proteſtants.</head>
               <p>I Who have been a <hi>Papiſt</hi> from my Infancy, till of late; and in Zeal for their horrid Principles, had too great a ſhare in the Firing of the City; and did intend to do further Miſchief to the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> of which I am now, and ever ſhall be a Member, do upon Abhorrence of that Villany and Religion that hath moved me to it, declare to all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> the Approach of their ſudden Ruine, that it may be prevented, if it be not too late.</p>
               <p>When, I together with other Papiſts, both <hi>French, Iriſh,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> fired the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; others were imployed to Maſſacre the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> we thinking thereby to deſtroy the Heads of your Religion; but the Maſſacre was diſappointed by the Fear of him who was the chief Agent in this Villany. And the Fire not having done all its Work,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48501:27"/>they have often endeavoured to fire the remaining part. They intend likewiſe to land the <hi>French</hi> upon you, to whoſe Aſſiſtance they all intend to come, and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe are ſtored with Arms; and have ſo far deceived the King, that they have the Command of moſt part of the Army, and the Sea-Ports. The <hi>French</hi> intend to land at <hi>Dover,</hi> that Gariſon being moſt <hi>Papiſts:</hi> And the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> have expreſs Command from <hi>Rome,</hi> to haſten their Buſineſs before the next Parliament, and to diſpatch. Therefore as you love your Lives and Fortunes, prevent your Ruine, by diſarming all the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially <hi>C. L.</hi>—from the <hi>Tower,</hi> and the <hi>L. D.</hi>—and all his Adherents and Souldiers, from <hi>Dover,</hi> and by diſarming all <hi>Papiſts.</hi> I have ſuch an Abhorrence, that I would willingly undergo any Puniſhment for it; and declare my ſelf openly, were I not aſſured that I could do you more good in concealing my Name for the preſent. Delay not from following theſe Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as you love your Lives; and be not deceived by any Pretences whatſoever.</p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>THomas Roe</hi> ſaith, that he hath for at leaſt twelve or thirteen Years laſt paſt been acquainted with one <hi>Joſeph Harriſon,</hi> who was examined lately at the <hi>Guild-hall, London,</hi> before the Honourable the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen, upon Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of his being a Conſpirator in the firing the City and Suburbs in ſeveral parts thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas Roe,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph Harriſon,</hi> having been School-fellows at <hi>Eaten Colledge,</hi> and being thereby acquainted; <hi>Joſeph Harriſon</hi> hath ſeveral times lately been with him, and adviſed him to with-draw his Concerns, and remove above twenty miles out of the City; for that the City, and twenty miles round, would be ſuddenly deſtroyed and laid waſt (or to that purpoſe.) Whereupon <hi>Thomas Roe</hi> asked him, Whether he were privy to any ſuch Conſpiracy, or concern'd in its Agitation? preſſing him with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Arguments to diſcover what he was acquainted with of that kind. <hi>Harriſon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, That he had no perſonal and poſitive Knowledge thereof. <hi>Thomas Roe</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded upon what ground then he did thus adviſe him? <hi>Joſeph Harriſon</hi> replied, That he was ſometimes converſant among ſome <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and perceived a Plot or Deſign was carrying on by them againſt the City of <hi>London,</hi> and the Proteſtant Religion; which Plot or Deſign, ſaid he the Papiſts call, <hi>The Game of Trap,</hi> or, do you underſtand <hi>Trap ad Crucem,</hi> which is the Watch-word amongſt them. Further, <hi>Joſhua Harriſon</hi> ſaid, that he was informed of thoſe things by ſome <hi>German</hi> Proteſtants, and that he had Offers of Fifty Pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> made him by ſome <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> to turn to their Religion; but he had refuſed it, and would not embrace the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas Roe</hi> further ſaith, That about five Weeks ſince, he walked through <hi>New-Cheap-ſide,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Mark-Lane,</hi> with <hi>Joſeph Harriſon,</hi> in company with Mr. <hi>Moſely</hi> (a Gentleman belonging to <hi>Bernards-Inn</hi> likewiſe) and one of his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, together with another Man, a Stranger to <hi>Thomas Roe.</hi> Upon their firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociating, <hi>Harriſon</hi> ſaid unto him, That he would not diſcover himſelf to be an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> but pretend himſelf to be a <hi>German</hi> or <hi>Italian</hi> (whether of the two he doth not well remember) and that he might not detect himſelf, ſpake in the Company as Occaſion offered in <hi>Latin.</hi> But leaving the place where they tarried in <hi>Mark-lane,</hi> going towards <hi>Biſhopſgate-ſtreet,</hi> Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> told Mr. <hi>Roe</hi> ſecretly, That he believed that Mr. <hi>Moſely</hi> underſtood the Game of <hi>Trap</hi> by ſome Signs he had obſerved from him, and that he would try him. Then going altogether into a houſe, about the end of <hi>Thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>adneedle-ſtreet,</hi> Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> (having by this time diſcovered himſelf to be an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh-man,</hi> ſaid <hi>Trap,</hi> and made a Croſs over his Face with his Finger, directing himſelf
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48501:28"/>to Mr. <hi>Moſely:</hi> Whereupon Mr. <hi>Moſely</hi> did alſo ſay <hi>Trap,</hi> croſſing his Forehead and Face two or three times, and with a quick motion drew his Finger over his own Throat. Upon which Mr. <hi>Roe</hi> asked Mr. <hi>Moſely</hi> what was the meaning of <hi>Trap?</hi> But he refuſed to tell. Mr. <hi>Roe</hi> urging him again, He replied, He would not; ſaying, You are not of my Religion. Then Mr. <hi>Moſely</hi> asked Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> what his Name was? (for he knew him not by Name) he anſwered, <hi>Harriſons</hi> Mr. <hi>Moſely</hi> replied, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw your Name. Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> made anſwer, It is <hi>Don Olanſo del Harriſonio;</hi> if ſo, ſaith Mr. <hi>Moſely,</hi> I have ſeen your Name.</p>
               <p>After this, Mr. <hi>Moſely</hi> and the other ſtranger being parted, and Mr. <hi>Roe</hi> and Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> being-alone: ſaid <hi>Hariſon,</hi> I told you Mr. <hi>Moſely</hi> did underſtand <hi>Trap;</hi> you may ſee there is a Liſt of the <hi>Trap-Gameſters,</hi> Now whether Mr. <hi>Moſely</hi>'s Imitation of Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> was feigned or real, Mr. <hi>Roe</hi> could not diſtinguiſh: But as they two were paſſing through <hi>Cheape-ſide</hi> homewards, Mr <hi>Harriſon</hi> looking upon the New Buildings, ſaid, To what purpoſe do they build this poor city, it will be again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; at the ſame time he pointed at two ſeveral Perſons, ſaying, That is a <hi>Trap-Gameſter,</hi> and there goes another <hi>Trap-Gameſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Roe</hi> further Informs, That ſince the laſt Term, Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi> told him, he would write all the Rogueries of the <hi>Trap-Game</hi> and <hi>Gameſters</hi> in a <hi>Play;</hi> and that he would undertake to ſhew him Twenty ſix Papiſts Meetings in and about the City and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs of <hi>London;</hi> but ſaid he ſome of them are very private, and if you be diſcovered not to be a Papiſt, (you will peradventure) be poiſoned or ſtabb'd.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Roe</hi> doth further ſay, That when the ſaid <hi>Harriſon</hi> adviſed him to remove with all his Concerns about twenty Miles from <hi>London,</hi> that the ſaid <hi>Roe</hi> asked him if <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor</hi> were not far enough, it being both their native place, and about the diſtance? The ſaid <hi>Harriſon</hi> anſwered, Not; reflecting upon the Caſtle. And further, <hi>Harriſon</hi> told Mr. <hi>Roe</hi> That the Jeſuits could, by a Compoſition of Ingredients, make ſuch a Matter, the fume of which would corrupt any Man's Intellects; and that he the ſaid <hi>Harriſon</hi> could do it.</p>

               <p>Upon the 26th of <hi>January</hi> 1679/80. <hi>John Satterthwait</hi> came to me, as I was going out of my Maſter's Gate, and did deſire me to tell him whether my Maſter and Miſtreſs were at home? And I anſwered him, <hi>No.</hi> And he told me, That he hoped he ſhould have an Opportunity to ſpeak with me, for he had ſomething to ſay. And I anſwered him, If he had any thing to ſay, I ſhould be ſo civil to give him the hearing when I had time (for then I was in haſte.) Then he came, the next Day, with the ſame Requeſt; and I returned the Anſwer. Then the third time, being <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> he came again, and uſed great Importunity; and expreſſed ſome Kindneſſes, as if he had been a Suitor; and prevailed with me to go into the <hi>Burrough</hi> with him to an Ale-houſe, where were two Men more of his Company: And after ſome little Diſcourſe, he propounded to me this wicked and horrid Deſign, which I was to have been engaged in with them; that is, to let them into my Maſter's houſe, to ſet it on fire: And for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, they promiſed me two thouſand Pounds; which Sum I was to receive at the <hi>Fleece-Tavern</hi> in <hi>Holborn,</hi> enquiring for a Room in the ſaid <hi>Tavern,</hi> called the Figure <hi>Nine.</hi> Then coming out of the Ale-houſe, they would fain have had me away with them; ſaying, <hi>Come let us take Coach, and go into</hi> Fleet-ſtreet; <hi>for,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>there we have a Prieſt of ours, who lodges at a Grocer's, that ſhall confeſs you, and give you the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> I told him, I could not poſſibly go then.</p>
               <p>So this <hi>John Satterthwait</hi> went homewards with me, almoſt to my Maſter's houſe, and as we went along, he charged me that I ſhould not divulge it to any Perſon in the World living; for if I did, I ſhould certainly die for it (and that quickly) in this World, and be damned in the other.</p>
               <p>Then he came on the next Day, and gave me the ſame Charge to keep it ſecret.</p>
               <p>And then, on <hi>Saturday,</hi> he came and enquired of me, the beſt time that he might come to do this moſt horrid and deviliſh Action; ſaying, <hi>Would not Four or Five of the Clock be a good time?</hi> And I ſaid, <hi>Yes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Accordingly he came, and conveyed himſelf into the Dye-houſe, or thereabouts, while Nine or ten of the Clock that Evening; about which time the Fire was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, with the Fear and Dread he had put upon me, I did deny it to the Company that came in to quench it; but after that, he was there, whom I ſaw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt of the Company: But I had much Horrour upon my Conſcience, and after ſome ſhort time, I confeſs'd the whole Crime, for which I now die. And my Examination before Juſtice <hi>Reading,</hi> and Juſtice <hi>Freeman</hi> was all true.</p>
               <p>And this I affirm, and do deſire all Proteſtants to believe, that <hi>John Satterthwait</hi> kindled thoſe three Fires in my Maſter's Houſe: Firſt, in the Dye-houſe, by the Pump: Secondly, in the Buttery: And Thirdly in the Garret. Which laſt Fire he kindled, whilſt the People were putting out the other.</p>

And having ſeriouſly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what Remedies may be moſt properly applied to thoſe growing Diſtempers, do in all Humility preſent your Majeſty with theſe our Petitions.</p>

               <p>We do therefore humbly intreat your Majeſty to conſider, that if this Match do proceed, it will be a means to diſquiet the Minds of your <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Subjects at home, and to fill them with endleſs Jealouſies and Diſcontents; and will bring your Majeſty into ſuch Alliances abroad, as will prove highly prejudicial, if not deſtructive to the Intereſt of the very <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And we find by ſad Experience that ſuch Marriages have encreaſed and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Popery in this Kingdom, and given opportunity to Prieſts and Jeſuits to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate their Opinions, and ſeduce great Numbers of your Majeſties Subjects.</p>
               <p>And we do already obſerve how much the Party is animated with the hopes of this Match, which were lately diſcouraged by your gracious Conceſſions in the laſt Meeting in this Parliament.</p>
               <p>That we greatly fear this may be an Occaſion to leſſen the Affections of the People to his Royal Highneſs, who is ſo nearly related to the Crown; and whoſe Honour and Eſteem we deſire may always be intirely preſerved.</p>
               <p>That for another Age more at the leaſt this Kingdom will be under the continual Apprehenſions of the Growth of Popery, and the Danger of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, We conſider that this Princeſs having ſo near a Relation and Kindred to many Eminent Perſons of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> may give them great Opportunities to promote their Deſigns, and carry on their Practices among us, and by the ſame means penetrate into your Majeſties moſt Secret Counſels, and more eaſily diſcover the State of the whole Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And finding that by the Opinions of very Learned Men, it is generally admitted that ſuch Treaties and Contracts by <hi>Proxies</hi> are diſſolvable, of which there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inſtances to be produced, We do in all humbleneſs beſeech your Majeſty to put a ſtop to the Conſummation of this intended Marriage.</p>
               <p>And this we do the more importunately deſire, becauſe we have not yet the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſee any Iſſue of your Majeſty's that may ſucceed in the Government of theſe Kingdoms, which Bleſſings we moſt heartily pray Almighty God in his due time to beſtow upon your Majeſty and theſe Kingdoms, to the unſpeakable Joy and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of all your Majeſty's Subjects, who deſire nothing more than to continue under the Reigns of your Majeſty, and your Royal Poſterity for ever.</p>

            <head>A LETTER FROM A PARLIAMENT-MAN to his FRIEND, Concerning the Proceedings of the Houſe of Commons This laſt Seſſion, begun the 13 of <hi>October,</hi> 1675.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I See you are greatly Scandalized at our ſlow and confuſed <hi>Proceedings.</hi> I confeſs you have cauſe enough, but were you but within theſe Walls for one half Day, and ſaw the ſtrange Make and Complexion that this Houſe is of, you would wonder as much that ever you wondred at it: For we are ſuch a pied Parliament, that none can ſay of what Colour we are; for we conſiſt of old Cavaliers, old Round-heads, Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Courtiers, and true Country Gentlemen; the two latter are moſt numerous, and would in probability bring things to ſome Iſſue, were they not clogged with the humorous uncertainties of the former. For the old Cavalier grown Aged, and almoſt paſt his Vice, is damnable Godly, and makes his doating Piety more a Plague to the World, then his youthful Debauchery was: For he is ſo much a Byggot to the Biſhops, that he forces his Loyalty to ſtrike Sail to his Religion, and could be content to pare the Nails a little of the Civil Government, ſo you would but let him ſharpen the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Tallons; which behaviour of his ſo exaſperates the Round-head, that he on the other hand cares not what Increaſes the Intereſt of the Crown receives, ſo he can but dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh that of the Miter: ſo that the Round-head had rather enſlave the Man, than the Conſcience; The Cavalier rather the Conſcience than the Man, there being a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſtock of Animoſity as proper matter to work upon.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe therefore the Courtier mutually plays: For if any Anticourt motion be made, he gains the Rounhead either to oppoſe or abſent, by telling them, <hi>If they will joyn him now, he will joyn with them for Liberty of Conſcience.</hi> And when any Affair is ſtarted on the behalf of the Country he aſſures the Cavaliers, <hi>If they will then ſtand by him, he will then joyn with them in promoting a Bill againſt the Fanaticks.</hi> Thus play they on both hands, that no Motion of a publick nature is made, but they win upon the one or other, of them; and by this Art gain a Majority againſt the Country Gentlemen, which otherwiſe they would never have: Wherefore it were happy that we had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Roundhead nor Cavalier in the Houſe; for they are each of them ſo Prejudicate one againſt the other, that their ſitting here ſignifies nothing but their Foſtering their old Venome, and lying at Catch to ſnap every Advantage to bear down each other, though it be in the Deſtruction of their Country.</p>
            <p>For if the Round-heads bring in a good Bill, the old Cavalier oppoſes it, for no other reaſon, but becauſe they brought it. So that as the poor <hi>Engliſh</hi> Silk-weavers, are feign to hire a <hi>French-man</hi> to ſell their Ribbons: So are the Round-heads a Cavalier, to move for thoſe Bills they deſire ſhould paſs; which ſo ſowers the Round-head, that he revenges that Carriage upon any Bill the Cavalier offers, and the Rage and the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the one and other, are ſo powerful, that it blinds them both, that neither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48501:32"/>the Advantage they give the Courtier, to abuſe both them and their Country too: ſo that if either of them do any Good, it is only out of pure Envy againſt the other. Thus you ſee how we are yoked, and ſeeing this, you may ceaſe your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration that we offer at all, and do juſt nothing.</p>
            <p>Nor is this Diviſion alone of the Houſe all we have to lament (for Death, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cure, does now every Day leſſen this evil) but that which is more our Miſery, is, that thoſe Gentlemen who are truly for the Good of their Country, will not be perſwaded to ſtand upon the ſure Baſis of Rational Principles (like Workmen too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive of their Judgments that will not build by Rule) but rather affect the moſt looſe Standing on the Sandy Foundation of Heat and Humour: By reaſon of which they often do as much Harm as Good, and yet perceive it not; this is the ſore evil we are under. For I would not doubt the Countries carrying it from the Court in every Vote, let the Courtiers uſe all the Art they could, would the Country Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men but give themſelves the trouble to enform their underſtandings a little, and not ſuffer themſelves to be hurried by a heedleſs Inadvertency into Vulgar Notions. Which, if well examined, are directly contrary to their honeſt Intentions; for lack of which they totally miſtake their Intereſts, fall foul on their Friends, ſupport their Enemies, and carry on the Deſigns of the Court whilſt they aim at the Service of their Country. For if they would take the pains but to think what is the greateſt Enemy in the World, <hi>Engliſh</hi> Law and Liberty always had, ſtill hath, and ever muſt have; It may be the reſult of ſuch a Thought would ſay, it was Encroaching Prerogative. Well, if then they would but beg from themſelves but ſo much Seriouſneſs, as to think this ſecond Thought, to check this Prerogative, which is ſo dangerous an Enemy to our Laws and Liberties, peradventure that Thought would anſwer, <hi>In ſuppreſſing all they could its Creatures and Dependants, and ſupporting ſuch, whoſe Intereſt it is to keep Prerogative within its juſt bounds.</hi> Now could they but be prevail'd with but to think a third Thought, it would land them at the full and ſatisfactory Solution of the Queſtion, and will hold in every thing. But I will put it in a Caſe wherein we are moſt apt to Err, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we reckon it no leſs than Piety to play the Fool, to the end you may ſee how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably we are cheated and abuſed, by ſucking in the untried Notions that Education, the Arts of others, or our own Ignorance have impoſed upon us.</p>
            <p>The third Thought therefore ſhall be this: <hi>Which are moſt the Creatures and Support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of boundleſs Prerogative, Prelates or Diſſenting Proteſtants?</hi> The Anſwer to which muſt, and can be no otherwiſe, <hi>The Prelates.</hi> Well then, if we would now reduce this to Practiſe, and ſay, <hi>The greateſt Friends to Prerogative are the Prelates, the greateſt Enemies to our Laws and Liberties is Prerogative.</hi> The only way therefore to reſtrain Prerogative, is to do, <hi>What?</hi> To fortifie and ſtrengthen the Yoke of the Prelates over the Neck of the People? <hi>No:</hi> (Surely this were an odd and a barbarous kind of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) <hi>But to give Liberty to Diſſenting Proteſtants, as the beſt means to keep up the Ballance againſt boundleſs Prerogative.</hi> For theſe muſt, and never can be otherwiſe (unleſs by Accident, and by Miſtake) than Friends to Liberty: But the Prelates neither are, nor can be otherwiſe then Creature to Prerogative, for all their Promotions, Dignities, and Domination depends upon it.</p>
            <p>The ſame might be ſaid concerning the only antient and true Strength of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Legal Militia, and a Standing Army. The Militia muſt, and can never be otherwiſe than for <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberty, 'cauſe elſe it doth deſtroy it ſelf; but a Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Force can be for nothing but Prerogative, by whom it hath its idle Living and Subſiſtance. I could inſtance alſo in many other Particulars, but our Inadvertency in this, is Demonſtration enough how much we are cheated by the common and hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney Notions impoſed upon us? and this is almoſt the cauſe of all the Error we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. For miſſing our true Footing, you ſee we have run in the miſtaken Notion of being for the Church ſo long, till we have almoſt deſtroyed the State, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Prerogative ſo much by ſuppreſſing Nonconformity, that it's well nigh beyond our reach or power to put a check to it, and had not Time, and but an indifferent Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, ſhewed us how much we were abuſed in this matter: and that a Lay-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt and a Fanatick can live as quietly and neighbourly together (would the Prelates but ſuffer them) as any in the world, we had ruined our ſelves paſt all recovery. For by our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ouying up the Biſhops in their harſh and irreconcilable Spirit, inſtead of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we have ſo fed and nouriſhed the Diſcontents throughout the Kingdom, that I think nothing keeps the Fire from Flaming out a freſh in another inteſtine War, but the bare Circumſtance of Opportunity only; and how long that will be able to reſtrain Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that are made wild by Oppreſſion, is worthy a very ſerious Conſideration; and therefore there is hardly any thing more a wonder to wiſe men, then to ſee the Clergy
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48501:32"/>run at this rate upon the Diſſenters: wherefore ſince the Nonconformiſts have given ſo large and ample a Teſtimony of their willingneſs to live Peaceably, if yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Clergy will not ſuffer them to be quiet in their Families and their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, I doubt, they may at one time or other, drive them into the Field, and then it may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed their Divine Art to conjure them down again; for he ſees but little, that ſees not the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Temper is better to be led then driven. And therefore I think it would not be more a Vanity, to compel the Ladies to wear Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Ruff, then to force the Nonconformiſts to be dreſt in her Religion.</p>
            <p>Nor yet are theſe all the Arts we are under: For we have a Gang that Huff, and bear themſelves high on the Country ſide, but earn only for the Court; theſe lay out their Craft in putting the Houſe upon little trifling things, and ſpend and waſte the Mettle thereof, upon ſuch pittiful Pickadilloes, as 'tis next to ſhame for an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament ſo much as to mention. Theſe ſtart a fierce Diſpute about ſome little Matter, and keep a bluſter as if none were ſuch faithful Patriots as they, when they do it on purpoſe only to while out the Time, and thin the Houſe, by tiring the honeſt Country Gentry in ſo tedious, fruitleſs and trifling Attendance. Do but move things worthy a Parliament; as that <hi>we may have our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>But further, theſe Countrey-Court Engines, after they have taken the Meaſures of the Houſe, at the opening of every Seſſion, by our Thanks for the gracious Speech, which being the true Pulſe of the Houſe; if it happen to come ſo hard as ſpeaks us but faint and cool to the one thing neceſſary, <hi>(the matter of Money)</hi> then they know what will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the Court will get no Griſt that Seſſions; and though the Court in Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could turn them home on the Morrow, yet it muſt conſult its Reputation a little, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain its Reſentments, and ſuffer them to ſit about a ſix Weeks, or two Months, and then they aſſure the Court, ſince they can get no good by them, they ſhall take no harm; and therefore to ſtop them from ſome worthy Undertaking, they by their feigned Zeal againſt Court Corruptions, put them upon Impeaching ſome Treaſurer, Councellor or Miniſter of State; and having ſpent half our time about this, the reſt is ſpent for the Clergy upon Church-Work, which we have been ſo often put upon and tired with theſe many Seſſions: Though Partiality unbecomes a Parliament, who ought to lay the whole Body that we repreſent alike eaſie, Nonconformiſts, as well as Conformiſts, for we were choſen by both, and with that Intention that we ſhould oppreſs neither. To lay one part therefore of the Body on a Pillow, and the other on a Rack, ſorts our Wiſdom lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but our Juſtice worſe. You now ſee all our Shapes, ſave only the Indigents, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom I need ſay but little, for their Votes are publickly ſaleable for a Guinea, and a Dinner every Day in the Week, unleſs the Houſe be upon Money or a Miniſter of State: For that is their Harveſt; and then they make their Earnings ſuit the Work they are about, which inclines them moſt conſtantly as ſure <hi>Cliants</hi> to the Court. For what with gaining the one and ſaving the other, they now and then adventure a Vote on the Country ſide; but the dread of Diſſolution makes them ſtrait tack about. The only thing we are obliged to them for, is, that they do nothin <hi>Gratis,</hi> but make every Tax as well Chargeable to the Court, as burthenſom to the Countrey, and ſave no Mans Neck, but they break his Purſe. And yet when all is ſaid, did but the Countrey Gentry rightly underſtand the Intereſt of Liberty, Let the Courtiers and Indigents do what they could, they might yet at laſt deſerve the Name of a worthy <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament; which that we may do, is not more paſſionately your Deſire, then it alſo is of,</p>

            <head>A SPEECH MADE BY Sir William Scrogg, ONE OF HIS <hi>Majeſties Sergeants at Law,</hi> To the Right Honourable the Lord High Chancellor Of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> AT HIS Admiſſion to the Place of One of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Juſtices of the Court of <hi>Common-Pleas.</hi>

            <p>THAT the King's Favour is the Effect of the Duty I have paid him, (which your Lordſhip is pleas'd to call Service) is the moſt welcome and pleaſing part of his Kindneſs; and I truſt we ſhall ſtill ſee ſuch Times that no Man ſhall hope to have it, or keep it on any other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. The right Application of Rewards and Puniſhments, is the ſteady Juſtice of a Nation; where though the Rewards of Kings exceed what a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject can merit. they ſhould never reach him that demerits. To return Good for Evil may be an Obligation of Charity; It is never of Bounty. And the taking off (as they call it) of an Ambitious, and therefore a Factious Man, by Favours, is the worſt way to ſtop or open his Mouth; for he will whiſper one way louder, then he will ſpeak the other: And when you think you gain one Enemy you make many.</p>
            <p>On ſuch an Occaſion as this, I think it very proper to give your Lordſhip ſome Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what Conſiderations I have had, in order to the Diſcharge of my Duty in this Place, ſince the King's firſt Intimations of his Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>And that reſpects Matters, either as they ſtand betwixt the King and his People, or betwixt Man and Man.</p>
            <p>As for the Firſt, I know that the Law gives ſuch Prerogatives to the King, that to endeavour more were to deſire worſe; and it gives to the People ſuch Liberties, that more would be Licentious.</p>
            <p>What then hath a Man to do that hath Courage enough to be Honeſt, but to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his Underſtanding to the Miniſtration of thoſe Laws juſtly to both: wherein I may ſay, that the Caſes will be rare that will be difficult in themſelves. They
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48501:33"/>may be made ſo from ſiniſter Cauſes; when Men thinking to ſerve a Turn, or like <hi>Pilate,</hi> to pleaſe the People, deliver up that which is Right to be Crucified. Then they are fain to rack their Fancies to make good their Faults. This makes ſuch nice Diſtinctions, and ſuch ſtrained Conſtructions, till they leave nothing plain in the World. Whereas in truth the Duty we owe to the King and his People, is like the Duty we owe to God, not hard to underſtand, whatever it is to Practiſe.</p>
            <p>This Court, <hi>My Lord,</hi> 'tis true, is properly a Court of <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> where Prerogative and Liberty are ſeldom Plaintiffs or Defendants, but yet 'tis certain, that even in private Cauſes, Matter of Government many times intervenes, and the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick is concern'd by Conſequence. And therefore I think it fair, and like <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Honeſty and Plainneſs, ſomething to unveil one's ſelf in that particular, that Men may know before-hand what they may expect. And herein I do declare, I would no more wrong or leſſen the People's Liberties, then I would ſacrifice up my Son. But then I will no more derogate from the King's Prerogative, then I would betray my Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> In time when Faction is ſo bold as to be bare-fac'd; and falſe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious News is openly talk'd, and greedily embrac'd; when the King's reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Demands are diſputed, and turned into Cavils, and thoſe that oppoſe 'em talk confidently; and thoſe that ſhould maintain 'em ſpeak fearfully and tenderly; when the Reverence we owe to the King is paid to the People; the Government is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, the King is in Danger, and there is nothing wanting but Opportunity.</p>
            <p>But when to prevent that Opportunity, Men are afraid, and hold it dangerous to avoid the Danger; when we dare not call a Crime by its right name; and for ſome, find none; and a Miſchief muſt be effected, before we will think it one: When dangerous Attempts are minc'd, and by ſome trivial difference Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is diſtinguiſh'd into a Treſpaſs; when Men are forward and ventrous enough in what thwarts the Government, but in ſupporting it, ſeem grave and cautious, nice and timorous, and ſo fill'd with Prudentials, till they are as wiſe as fear can make 'em: The Law is enervated, and becomes uſeleſs to its greateſt end, which is, the Preſervation of the whole.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, in Publick Cauſes, the ſame Integrity is neceſſary as in Private; But that is but part of a Judge's Duty. He muſt be Magnanimous as well as Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous. And I acknowledge it to be a main and principal part of my Duty, as it relates to the King and his People, with hearty Reſolution to ſuppreſs all open Force and private Confederacies; not thinking any thing little that attempts the Publick Safety; for when the Motives are ſmall, the Danger is greater; when Diſcontents exceed their Cauſes.</p>
            <p>And for the Diſcharge of my Duty betwixt Party and Party, it is impoſſible to be performed without theſe two Cardinal Virtues, [Temper] and [Cleanneſs of Hands] Temper comprehends Patience, Humility and Candor. It ſeems to me that Saying, <hi>Be quick to hear, and ſlow to ſpeak,</hi> was made on purpoſe for a Judge. No Direction can be apter, and no Character becomes him better: and he that would not be ſaid to have but one Ear, methinks ſhould be aſhamed to have none. And I appeal to your Lordſhips Experience, if a patient Attention, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with indifferent Parts, and a Competency in the Law, with a mind fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſed for Information or Conviction, will not, as to Uſe and common Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, exceed the profoundeſt Knowledge, and moſt towering Underſtanding, that is attended with an impetuous Haſte, either out of a glory of Speaking, or too great a fulneſs of himſelf.</p>
            <p>And for Humility, Though I will not ſay that every Impatient Man is proud, (becauſe that may ariſe from other Cauſes) yet every proud Man is impatient, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of Information, always of Contradiction; and he muſt be violent to maintain his own Imperiouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Harſhneſs is a needleſs and unbecoming Provocation: It makes Men hate where they ſhould fear and reverence: And yet by Gentleneſs I underſtand, not Tameneſs, but Moderation; not without Rebukes, but without Taunts.</p>
            <p>For Corruption, that Perverter of Law and Deſtruction of Property, that leaves in the World neither <hi>Bonum</hi> nor <hi>Equum;</hi> for when he does Right, he does not Juſtice; and he that ſells Juſtice, will ſell Injuſtice. 'Tis not only to be avoided, but abhorred; and not alone in its direct Approaches, but in Relatives and Servants, thoſe By-ways of Bribery; and it becomes every man ſo manifeſtly to deteſt, that it may ſcare even the Attempt: for no Man is ſufficiently ſafe unleſs to his Power he avoids the Suſpicion as well as the Fault. Practiſe does
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48501:34"/>one and that which makes me ſpeak this, a publick Profeſſion againſt it, is the way to do the other.</p>
            <p>And where Gifts prevail not; yet if Fear, Relation or Popularity ſway, 'tis the ſame thing. If there be a Byaſs put to a Man, it matters not of what 'tis made. Nay, theſe are worſe than Corruption by Money; for there both ſides may have the ſame Tools, when a Man cannot make himſelf a Kin, nor his Cauſe Popular.</p>
            <p>And now give me leave, <hi>My Lord,</hi> to ſhew why I thought it fit, nay extreamly neceſſary to ſay ſomething on the particulars I have mentioned.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to ſatisfie your Lordſhip and the World I undertake not this Place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due Conſiderations of the Duty belongs to it. Next, It is ſome Tye upon a Man not to commit thoſe Errors he hath in Publick declaimed againſt: for he muſt add Impudence to his Crime, to have his own words fly in his face, with which every Man will upbraid, and no Man can excuſe him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> In a Diſcourſe on ſuch an Occaſion as this, where Men are concern'd in Point of Intereſt, (for ſo they are when a Judge is made) my Aim is not to ſay what will pleaſe their Humours, but what ſhould ſatisfie their Minds: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther am I ſo vain as to think I ſhall do that with all; nor much concerned though it fall out ſo. If Reputation and a good Name can be got by doing my Duty, 'tis welcome; but if it muſt be ſought by other Arts, I will be no Seeker; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially conſidering that the Applauſe of the Multitude, that Contingent Judge of Good and Bad, rather attends the Vain than the Virtuous, and is oftner ſought by ſuch too. The Approbation of the Wiſe, which are the Few; and of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, by which I intend, Men heartily affected to the Government, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I earneſtly covet: for them that are otherwiſe, I court not their good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, becauſe I fear not their bad; and would not draw that Suſpicion upon my ſelf, that Men may ſay, What Ill has he done, that thoſe Men ſpeak ſo well of him? I never was of their Party, nor never will be. And to be even with them, I think as meanly of them as they do of Loyalty; whoſe Misfortunes are more to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed than their Triumphs. The good Words of ſuch as truly love their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, (which no Man ever did that does not love his Prince) indeed I highly prize, and will endeavour to deſerve; though your Lordſhip at this time has been before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with me in that Particular, by beſtowing them upon me firſt; and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that I am aſhamed I have been no better to have made 'em good: But becauſe your Lordſhip is willing and able to render any Man much better then he is, they ought to be eſteemed as the Proceed of a Generous Nature, and an Indulgent Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; which by telling me what I am, does but kindly inſinuate what I ſhould be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> I will waſte no more of your Time, though I omit thoſe uſual Returns of formal Thanks; for they are of courſe; or extream wondring at the great Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizals of the Kings Favour; and thoſe humble, yet high Debaſements of ones Self, which look like Modeſty but is a ſort of Bravery.</p>
            <p>My Thanks ſhall be paid in (what the KING likes beſt) Service to His People. The wonder will ceaſe by that time I get to the Bench: and my Defects are beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by endeavouring to amend them.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>YOU gave me a Brief, and a Pertinent Deduction the other Day, of the <hi>French</hi> Practices and Deſigns; the Progreſs of their Arms, and the Methods of their Proceedings: Together with a Scheme of the inevitable Ruine and Slavery that threatens <hi>Europe,</hi> without a ſpeedy and a powerful Conjunction againſt them.</p>
            <p>After this general Contemplation of the preſent State of <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> you were pleaſed to take a particular Proſpect of the Intereſt of this Nation; and how far we are to reckon our ſelves concerned in the Common Calamity: Coming at laſt to this Concluſion, That <hi>England cannot reaſonably expect to ſtand long, after the Loſs of</hi> Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>and</hi> Flanders. For the Support of this Opinion, (beſides the Force of your own Reaſoning) you referr'd me to ſeveral Hiſtorical and Political Treatiſes upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; which I have diligently examin'd, and made uſe of, in this following Diſcourſe; wherein I take the Freedom to give you my Thoughts upon the whole matter.</p>
            <p>Your firſt Charge upon the <hi>French,</hi> was, Breach of Faith: and you pitch'd upon the Caſes of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Portugal;</hi> the barbarous uſage of the Duke of <hi>Lorain;</hi> and the Nulling of the moſt <hi>Chriſtian Queens</hi> Renunciation upon Marriage; (which was the very Foundation of the <hi>Pyrenean Treaty</hi>) by a pretended Devolution of the <hi>Spaniſh Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> in the Right of that Match: Their underhand Tampering of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Swede,</hi> to draw the One from us, and hinder the Other from joyning with us; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence they had upon our Diſgrace at <hi>Chatham;</hi> their playing Booty on both ſides, betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> in the <hi>Dutch-war:</hi> and to theſe Inſtances, (which are all ſo notorious that they need no expounding) you might have added a thouſand more of the like Quality. But theſe may ſuffice for a ſeaſonable and a neceſſary Caution, and without the Helps of Aggravation and Clamour; eſpecially that extraordinary Action of deſtroying the <hi>Queens Renunciation,</hi> and then invading the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi> upon it: An Action hardly to be paralell'd in the Story of the whole World, for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of ſo many enormous Circumſtances. There was in it, <hi>The Publick Faith of the two Crowns;</hi> which is the only Security of Government, and the Bond of Humane Society: There was in it <hi>The Solemnity of an Oath at the very Altar;</hi> which is the moſt Sacred Tye of a <hi>Chriſtian:</hi> There was alſo <hi>The higheſt Profeſſion, and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Friendſhip imaginable;</hi> which is accompted one of the moſt binding Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions betwixt Man and Man: And then there was a <hi>Brother, a Couſin, and an Infant in the Caſe;</hi> which makes it Matter of Humanity and Honour. And yet all theſe Cords were as eaſily broken as Bulruſhes. This ſingle Preſident may ſerve, however, for a warning to all Princes and States, not to leave themſelves at the mercy of Men of ſuch Principles. But his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty is not the only Prince that has been abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Corrupt and Ambitious Miniſters.</p>
            <p>Your next obſervation was, That they are the greateſt Intermedlers in the World, in other Peoples Affairs, that they embroil all wherever they come; and that there's hardly any Rebellion, but they are in the bottom of it. For their Money walks in all the Courts and Councils of <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> nay, and beyond it too: For 'tis ſaid that the

               </gap>owning of the Work which they themſelves began, in the Execrable Murther of the late King? and did they not refuſe to our Gracious and Perſecuted Sovereign—even a Retreat in their Dominions? How did they prolong the War in <hi>Portugal?</hi> What Havock have they made in <hi>Poland,</hi> and what work in <hi>Hungary?</hi> And are they not this Day in Counſel with the Port againſt the Empire, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the Bulwark of <hi>Chriſtendom?</hi> How have they daſh'd <hi>England</hi> againſt <hi>Holland;</hi> blinded the Eyes of ſeveral Princes of the Empire; and baffled all Mediations towards a General Peace? Did they not formerly, under the Colour of Protecting <hi>Germany,</hi> cut off <hi>Alſatia</hi> from the Empire? and in a word, this has been their Practice where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they have come: <hi>They covet Harbours in</hi> Spain, (ſays the Admirable <hi>Baron de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Iſola) Leagues in the Empire; Factions in</hi> Poland; <hi>Wars in</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Holland; <hi>Paſſes into</hi> Italy; <hi>and the Sovereign Arbitrage every where. Their Quiet conſiſts in the Trouble of all others, and their Advantage is in the Publick Calamities.</hi> Nor have they any other way, then by dividing, and weakening of the parts, to maſter the whole, which is the Capital Deſign. And if ſo, There's no Fence againſt a Common Enemy, but a Common Union.</p>
            <p>It is already made appear, by what is above ſaid, how dangerous they are to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. The next hint you gave me, was to conſider on't, Whether the <hi>Engliſh</hi> may reaſonably expect any better Quarter from them, then other People: in which point, I ſhall only lay the matter before you, and leave you the Judge on't.</p>
            <p>The Four main Intereſts of a Nation, are Religion, Reputation, Peace, and Trade. For the Firſt of theſe; we ſhall neither fare the better, nor the worſe; but loſe juſt as much for being of another Communion, as his <hi>Catholick Majeſty</hi> gets by being of the ſame. The Queſtion now on Foot is a Communion of State, not of Faith. The <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel</hi> go hand in hand; and at the ſame time, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and perſecuted in <hi>France.</hi> To ſay nothing of the Encouragements they give there to the <hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> which may, for ought we know, prove the greateſt Blow to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that ever it received ſince the Reformation. But what do I talk of Religion, in a Cauſe that is dipp'd in Chriſtian Blood, and in the Tears of Widows and Orphans? A Cauſe that is propagated by Sacriledge, Rapes, Depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, Slavery, Oppreſſion, and at leaſt a Million of Lives ſacrificed to it already? The very Thought of it is enough to ſtrike the Soul of any Man with Horrour and Indignation.</p>
            <p>If you would ſee how tenderly they have handled us in the Buſineſs of Reputation: Pray do but caſt an Eye upon the Character of an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man in their <hi>Politique de France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quant a ce qui eſt des Anglois, ils n'ont aucuns amis, ce ſont des gens ſans Foy, ſans Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſans Probite, ſans Juſtice aucune, defians, legers au dernier point, Cruels, Impatiens, Gourmands, Superbes, Audacieux, Avares, Propres pour les coups de main, et pour une promte execution, mais incapables de conduire une Guerre avec judgment. Leur Pais eſt aſſez bon pour vivre, mais il n' eſt pas aſſez riche pour leur fournir les moyens de ſortir, &amp; de faire aucune conqueſte: auſſi n' ont ils jamais rien conquis, excepte L' Irelande, dont les habitans ſont fobiles, &amp; mauvais Soldats,</hi> &amp;c. i. e. <hi>As for the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>they are a People without Friends, without Faith, Religion, Honeſty or Juſtice; Diſtruſtful, and Fickle to the higheſt Degree imaginable, Cruel, Impatient, Gluttonnous, Proud, Audacious; they will do well enough for a Rubber at Cuffs, or a ſudden Exploit, but they underſtand nothing at all of the Government of a War. The Country is paſſable enough for them to live in; but not rich enough to offer at any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt abroad; nor did they ever make any, but upon the</hi> Iriſh, <hi>which are a weakly People, and ill Soldiers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think it were not amiſs in this place, to deſire our Impertinent Undertaker to turn back to the Hiſtory of <hi>Philip de Valois.</hi> and he ſhall there find there that our <hi>Edward</hi> the III. made a Shift with one Army to beat 60000 <hi>French,</hi> and leave betwixt Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and forty Thouſand of them upon the place; and with another Army in the Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick of <hi>Durham</hi> to defeat as many <hi>Scots,</hi> and cut off 15000 of them too. And it muſt not be here omitted, that this <hi>Scotch</hi> Army was alſo animated by <hi>French</hi> Counſels. I would not willingly run out a Letter into a Volume, ſo that all other Reflections apart, I ſhall only add, that if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had not once recovered the Field, and another time made it good in two of the greateſt Actions of late that have yet paſſed betwixt the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> 'tis the Opinion of Wiſe Men, that the later would not have had much to brag of upon the Succeſs of this War. And this in ſome degree is acknowledged by the Author of a <hi>French Relation of the Actions betwixt the two Armies in</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:48501:35"/>1675, 1676, and 1677, (how Romantical ſoever in other Caſes). Speaking of the Battle under the Command of the <hi>Count de Lorge,</hi> after the Death of the <hi>Vicount Turenne,</hi> theſe are his words, <hi>Et a rendre juſtice aux</hi> Anglois, <hi>&amp; aux</hi> Irlandois, <hi>on peut dire, qu'on leur doit une bonne partie de cette victoire:</hi> That is to ſay, <hi>And to give the</hi> Engliſh <hi>and</hi> Iriſh <hi>their due,</hi> France <hi>is indebted to them in a large meaſure for this Victory.</hi> But now to our Politician again: <hi>Ils ſe haiſſent les uns les autres, &amp; ſont en diviſion continuelle, ſoit pour la Religion, ſoit pour le Government. The</hi> Engliſh, ſays he, <hi>hate one another, and are ſtill quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling, either about Religion or Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Indecencies would almoſt make a Man call them Names; but let us paſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one angry word, from the Intereſt of our <hi>Reputation,</hi> to that of our <hi>Peace,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how they ſtand affected to us upon that point. To ſay, that <hi>England</hi> has not for a long time had any Troubles either at home or abroad, which the <hi>French</hi> have not promoted, or improv'd to their own advantage; is to ſay no more than that they deal with <hi>us,</hi> as they do with <hi>all the World beſide;</hi> ſo that we muſt e'en have recourſe again to their <hi>Politicks</hi> for ſome particular Mark of their Favour, where you ſhall find that our State-Mountebank has not yet ſhewn all his Tricks, but puts himſelf with a very grave and fore-caſting Countenance upon the very Project of our Ruine: <hi>Une Guerre de France, de trois ou quatre ans contre eux les ruinera entierement, ainſi il ſemble qu'il ne faut point faire de paix avec eux qu' a des Conditions qui nous ſoient tres avantageuſes. A War</hi> (ſays he) <hi>of three or four Years with</hi> France, <hi>would abſolutely deſtroy the</hi> Engliſh; <hi>ſo that methinks we ſhould not entertain any Peace with them, but upon very profitable Terms.</hi> And then a little after: <hi>In fine,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the way to undo the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>is to make them keep an Army on foot; and there's no fear of their Landing in</hi> France, <hi>but to their certain deſtruction, unleſs they ſhould be invited by a Rebellion; without which, their Troops will in a ſhort time most undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly fall foul one upon another. To keep them upon continual Expence, 'tis but giving them the Alarm upon the Iſles of</hi> Jerſey, <hi>and</hi> Guernſey, Wight, <hi>and</hi> Man, Ireland, <hi>and the</hi> Cinque Ports; <hi>by which means, they will be put upon the Charge of Fortifications and Garriſons, which will perſwade the People that the King intends to ſet up a Standing Army, and an Arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. So long as this holds, the Nation will never be at quiet, but torment themſelves with Fears and Jealouſies, which may be eaſily fomented by Letters in Cypher, to ſuch or ſuch particular Perſons; and in ſuch ſort to be intercepted as ſhall be found convenient. Theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters may give a Hint of a Deſcent in</hi> Ireland, <hi>and elſewhere, which would diſpoſe the</hi> Iriſh, <hi>who mortally hate the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>to a Revolt; and among the ſuſpicious Multitude they would</hi> paſs <hi>for Goſpel. This Contrivance would make the</hi> Scots <hi>alſo to bethink themſelves of recovering their Liberty; where there must be Parties made, and the Sects encourag'd one against another; eſpecially the</hi> Roman Catholicks <hi>must be fairly handled, and private Aſſurance given (in the Name of the King of</hi> England) <hi>to the</hi> Benedictins, <hi>(who are eaſie enough to be impos'd upon) that they ſhall be reſtor'd to all their former Benefits, according to the Printed</hi> Monaſticon; <hi>which will preſently make the</hi> Roman Catholicks <hi>declare themſelves; and the Monks will move Heaven and Earth for the bringing of Matters about: But then Care must be taken to carry on the Report, that the King is of the</hi> Romiſh Religion; <hi>which will diſtract the Government, and throw all into an Abſolute Confuſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence we may gather: Firſt, What Opinion the <hi>French</hi> have of us. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That it is not only their Deſire and Study, but a formed Deſign to embroyl us. Thirdly, That they will ſtick at nothing neither, to compaſs that End, be it never ſo foul. Fourthly, This Libeller has trac'd us out the very Methods of their working: As by amuſing the People with forged Letters of Intelligence, where the firſt Author of the Plot muſt miraculouſly diſcover it. By filling the Peoples Heads with Fears and Jealouſies, and leaving no Stone unturn'd in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ſtir up a Rebellion. Why has he not advis'd the Poyſoning of all our Fountains too? which would have been a Courſe of as much Chriſtianity and Honour. But that this Trifler may not glorifie himſelf too much in his wondrous Speculations, take Notice, that he is only the Tranſcriber, not the Author of this goodly Piece, for the Original was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Richlieu</hi> and <hi>Mazarine;</hi> and it amounts to no more in effect, than an imperfect Hiſtory of the <hi>French</hi> Dealings with us for a long time, and particularly in our late Troubles.</p>
            <p>To come now from his moſt unmannerly Malice, to his Reaſon of State; if I am not miſtaken: England <hi>might longer ſubſiſt in a War with</hi> France, <hi>than</hi> France <hi>could in a Peace within it ſelf</hi> (the heavieſt of all Judgments, when a Nation muſt be wicked upon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity). And again, when he ſays, That England <hi>cannot hurt</hi> France <hi>by a Deſcent, unleſs call'd in by a Rebellion.</hi> He never conſiders, That if <hi>England had an Army a-foot, and ſtood inclin'd to make uſe of it that way, we ſhould not be long without an Invitation.</hi> For we ſee what the <hi>Bourdelois,</hi> &amp;c. did upon their own Bottom, and without any Forreign
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48501:36"/>Encouragement; and the whole Buſineſs miſcarried only for want of a vigorous Second. Laſtly, Give me leave to ſay, that he has extreamly over-ſhot himſelf in one thing more; for tho' this has been realty the Practice of the <hi>French,</hi> and is at this day the very Model and Rule by which their Emiſſaries govern themſelves; it ſhould yet have been kept as the greateſt Secret in the World: for the owning of theſe Inglorious Artifices in Publick, makes it one of the groſſeſt Libels that ever was written againſt the <hi>French Government:</hi> to ſay nothing of his overſight in diſobliging the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> and laying Snares to trepan them.</p>
            <p>The Queſtion of <hi>Trade</hi> has been ſo beaten already, that there remains little to be added to it. Nor in truth needs it, ſince it is agreed on all hands, that the <hi>French</hi> ſet up for an <hi>Univerſal Commerce,</hi> as well as for an <hi>Univerſal Monarchy.</hi> And in effect, the one is but a neceſſary conſequent upon the other. Nor is it enough, it ſeems, for us to be deſign'd upon by them, without lending them our Hands towards the Cutting of our own Throats: <hi>For upon a ſober and judicious Eſtimate, we are Loſers by our Trade with</hi> France, <hi>at leaſt a Million and an half</hi> per Annum. I ſhall conclude this Head with one paſſage more out of our <hi>Pelitiques of France:</hi> (And you'll ſay 'tis a pleaſant one too, but it muſt be under the Roſe) Upon a preſuppoſal of Miſchief that's a Brewing in <hi>England: Now,</hi> ſays he, <hi>it will be our Buſineſs to renew our Alliance with</hi> Holland; <hi>we can wheedle them into an Opinion, that they are the only Men that underſtand the Knack of Trade, ſo that they ſhall have that to themſelves: the Talent of the</hi> French, <hi>alas! lies another way; and there's no forcing of any thing against Nature: and that now's the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now to ſum up all that's ſaid: If the <hi>French</hi> can diſpence with <hi>Oaths,</hi> and <hi>Solemn Contracts:</hi> If it be their <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> and a Branch of their <hi>Policy,</hi> to <hi>fiſh in troubled Waters:</hi> If they <hi>hate</hi> us, as <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> and are not for us, as <hi>Reformed Catholicks:</hi> If they do all they can to wound us in our <hi>Reputation,</hi> our <hi>Peace,</hi> and our <hi>Trade,</hi> we may take for granted, that they will deſtroy us to all purpoſes if they can, which naturally leads me to an Enquiry, how far we are in their Power, or likely ſo to be, that we may take our Meaſures accordingly.</p>
            <p>It will not ſtand with the brevity I propoſe in this Paper, to give you a <hi>Geographi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> or an <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> Account of Places or Actions: But in as few words as I can, I am to preſent you with a general View of the preſent State of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> with a regard to the Power of <hi>France;</hi> and then to conſider how far <hi>England</hi> may be concern'd in the Common Fate. Here it was that you and I brake off in our laſt Diſcourſe; ſo that in the proſecution of it, I muſt try to walk without leading, (ſaving only the helps that I have gathered from certain Tracts which I have read, upon his Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) wherein I ſhall ſteer a middle courſe, betwixt ſome that over-value the Strength of <hi>France,</hi> and others that will have it to be leſs than indeed it is.</p>
            <p>That the Arms of <hi>France</hi> are at this day formidable to all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied, and <hi>Tacitus</hi> gives you the reaſon of it, in the Caſe of the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Britains, Rarus</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ad propulſandum commune Periculum conventus: ita, dum ſinguli pugnant, univerſi vincuntur.

But it muſt be allowed, that they are more indebted for their Greatneſs, to the Slips and Overſights of others, (and this without diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment too) than they are to their proper Conduct and Valour. The advance they made into <hi>Flanders</hi> in 1667, was introduced by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> truſting to their Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of Friendſhip, and rather imputable to an exceſs of Charity, than any want of Precaution; though it ſeemed not very likely, that they ſhould march with Horſe. Foot, and Cannon, only to go a Birding. Through theſe and the like Arts they have rais'd themſelves to that dangerous height where now we behold them; taking all Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the unſetled Condition of <hi>Spain;</hi> the Diviſions of the Empire, and the Factions in <hi>Holland,</hi> and of all other Miſtakes in point of Fore-ſight and Reſolution elſewhere. You know very well, the Conqueſts they have made upon the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands;</hi> a conſiderable part of <hi>Germany</hi> with the Terror and Devaſtation that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies them every-where: The Progreſs of their Arms in <hi>Catalonia, Sicily,</hi> the <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Indies,</hi> &amp;c. Now what may be the Conſequences of this over-growing Power, and how to prevent them, is the matter in Queſtion.</p>

            <p>AS it is without Diſpute, that the <hi>French</hi> aim at <hi>Univerſal Dominion,</hi> (which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a more plauſible Cover for that <hi>Univerſal Slavery</hi> which muſt create it) ſo is it accompted as indubitable a Principle, that the Conqueſt of <hi>Flanders</hi> muſt be the Foundation of it. And according to this Maxim it is, that they take their Meaſures; for they have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There are a great many People, I know, that promiſe themſelves mighty things from the event of another <hi>Campania,</hi> for want I fear of conſulting the Chart; and the almoſt inſuperable Difficulties that lie in the way; The means they propoſe are either by carrying the War into <hi>France,</hi> by way of <hi>Revulſion,</hi> or by forcing the <hi>French</hi> upon a Capital Battel; The former Propoſition ſeems Firſt very impracticable; and Secondly, of little or no Advantage, if it could be effected. It muſt be conſidered that beyond <hi>Mentz, Coblentz</hi> and <hi>Treves,</hi> the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> have no Magazine at all beſide that betwixt <hi>Treves</hi> and <hi>France</hi> (a part of <hi>Luxenburg</hi> excepted) is abſolutely in the Enemies Power. Now how ſhould an Army ſubſiſt there, that muſt over and above, paſs through a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of about twenty Leagues, that is wholly laid waſte, and in aſhes, and without any Cattle in it, or any other ſort of neceſſary Proviſion?</p>
            <p>Put the Caſe now that the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> ſhould break through all theſe Difficulties, and carry an Army even into the <hi>Lorrain</hi> it ſelf, the Country of <hi>Metzin</hi> or <hi>Burgundy,</hi> (which would take them up the beſt part of a Summer too) all the ſtrong holds are in the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> and the Country laid ſo deſolate, that there's no living for an Army there. When 'tis come to this, they muſt reſolve either upon a Battel or Siege. If the former, The <hi>French</hi> are at liberty whither they will Fight, or no, and there's no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling of them; for they are among their ſtrong holds; and all's their own both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, and on each ſide, and the Country either burnt or deſerted. But carry it farther yet, and ſuppoſe the <hi>French</hi> forc'd upon the Riſque of a Battel, Firſt, the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts</hi> are not ſure to get the better of it. And Secondly, What if they ſhould? Nay to the Degree of an entire <hi>Victory?</hi> All that would be expected more for that Year, would be only to take in ſome conſiderable Poſt, and make good the ground they had gotten for the next Campagne: For it would be a madneſs to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſue their Victory into the heart of an Enemies Country, and leave ſo many Garriſons upon their backs, which would undoubtedly cut off all their Convoys and ſtarve them.</p>
            <p>But this is ſtill the ſuppoſing of a Thing not to be ſuppoſed; for the <hi>French</hi> in this Caſe, would ſtand upon the Defenſive, and not to come to a Battel. Or in caſe they ſhould, and he worſted; they have Men enough in Garriſon for Recruits, that would immediatly reinforce them.</p>
            <pb n="64" facs="tcp:48501:37"/>
            <p>Now on the other ſide, what if the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> ſhould chance to be routed? The Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons which the <hi>French</hi> hold in <hi>Lorrain, Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Alſatia,</hi> would in ſuch Caſe, totally deſtroy that broken Army, and cut out ſuch work in <hi>Germany,</hi> as has has not been known in the <hi>Empire</hi> for many Ages.</p>
            <p>In this extremity, let us ſuppoſe that the <hi>Empire</hi> ſhould yet bring another Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Field; and try the Iſſue of a Second Battle, and miſcarry: And that the diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Princes of the <hi>Empire,</hi> ſhould declare themſelves for the Enemy; all that part of <hi>Germany</hi> that lies within two or three Days Journey of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> would be irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably loſt; a great part of it being ſo harraſed already, that 'tis not able ſo much as to furniſh an Army upon a March, much leſs for a Winter Quarter.</p>
            <p>Now to the Buſineſs of a Siege, the <hi>French</hi> have taught us, by <hi>Philipsburg</hi> and <hi>Maſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richt,</hi> that they want neither Skill to fortifie a Place, nor Courage to defend it. So that without a great loſs of Time and Men, it cannot be expected that the Imperialiſts ſhould make themſelves Maſters of any conſiderable Place: and when they ſhall have carried it; what will a Town in <hi>Lorain,</hi> or <hi>Burgundy</hi> ſignifie to the ſaving of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> which if once loſt, are hardly ever to be retriv'd?</p>
            <p>Now taking this for granted; if <hi>England</hi> does not ſtep in with all the Speed and Vigor imaginable, ſee what will be the end on't, Firſt, That the <hi>French,</hi> being Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of all the Poſts, Paſſes and Strong-holds in <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Burgundy,</hi> may dodge and trifle the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> at Pleaſure; and make them ſpend out the Year without any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> The way would have been for the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> to have preſt with an Army of 50000 Men directly into the Body of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate</hi> Troops in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> to have made another Inrode by the way of <hi>Picar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> or <hi>Bologne;</hi> but ſince the taking of <hi>Valenciennes, Cambray</hi> and St. <hi>Omer,</hi> there's no poſſibility of piercing <hi>France</hi> that way, So that a very ſmall Army now upon the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Netherlands,</hi> with the help of the <hi>French</hi> Garriſons, is ſufficient to amuſe and tire out the whole Force of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> upon that Quarter.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>France</hi> being thus ſecured on that ſide will unqueſtionably fall in with all their Power upon the <hi>Empire;</hi> unleſs diverted by the Alarm they have now received from <hi>England.</hi> Now admitting this to be the Condition of <hi>France,</hi> let any Man of Senſe judge what Good the <hi>Imperial Army</hi> can do to the <hi>Netherlands</hi> (upon which ſingle point depends the Fortune of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>) What if they ſhould March up to the Borders of <hi>France</hi> with 50000 Men? Will not the <hi>French</hi> encounter them there with as many, or more? And with this odds too, that the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> ſuffer a thouſand Incommodities in their March through a ruin'd Country; Whereas the <hi>French</hi> have good Quarters, and plenty of all things at hand, watching the others Motions and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving all Advantages againſt them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In this Poſture of Affairs, the <hi>Confederates</hi> muſt never expect to do any great Matter upon the <hi>French,</hi> in theſe Provinces unleſs they do very much out num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them.</p>
            <p>And it is likwiſe to be conſidered, that theſe Troubles falling out in the Minority of his <hi>Catholick Majeſty,</hi> the Diſtractions of that Government, the Revolt of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and great Diſorders upon the Frontiers of <hi>Spain;</hi> the <hi>Netherlands</hi> have been much neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, till the Elevation of his Highneſs <hi>Don Joan</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> to the Dignity of <hi>Prime Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.</hi> And that it is not poſſible for him, by reaſon of the many Exigencies of that Crown nearer home, to ſend any conſiderable Succour to the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then by Supplies of Money: So that by that time the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> and the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> are got into their Winter-Quarters, or at leaſt, before they take the Field again, the <hi>French</hi> from time to time will be ready with freſh Troops out of their Garriſons to proſecute their Conqueſts; which by Degrees muſt needs break the hearts of the poor Inhabitants, when they find that neither their Faith, nor their Courage, is able any longer to protect them. And when that Day comes, what by their Armies, and what by other Influences, the <hi>French</hi> will have as good as Subjected Two thirds of <hi>Europe.</hi> And there will alſo occur theſe farther Difficulties. Firſt, No body knows where the <hi>French</hi> will begin their Ataque; which will oblige the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and <hi>Hollander</hi> to ſtrengthen all their Garriſons as far as their Men will reach. Secondly, When the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> Troops ſhall be ſo diſpers'd, whereſoever the <hi>French</hi> ſit down, they muſt then give themſelves for loſt, for want of an Army to relieve them; beſide their furious and obſtinate manner of Aſſault, for they care not how many Men they loſe, ſo they carry the place. (And then moſt of the Men too are made Priſoners of War.) Nor is the Seaſon of the Year any Diſcouragement to them neither; witneſs their Firſt Irruption into <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and the reſtleſs Activity of their Troops even at this Inſtant.</p>
            <pb n="65" facs="tcp:48501:37"/>
            <p>So ſoon as their work in <hi>Flanders</hi> is over (which only <hi>England</hi> under Heaven, is able to prevent or Check) the <hi>French</hi> will have an Army of at leaſt 50000 Men about <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain, Luxenburg</hi> and <hi>Burgundy</hi> to face the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> and at the ſame Time with as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more perhaps they will ſeize upon the Dutchy of <hi>Juliers,</hi> and of <hi>Cleves,</hi> and from thence paſs the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to countenance thoſe that are of the <hi>French Cabal,</hi> on the ſide of <hi>Weſtphalia;</hi> and ſo in due time, ſeveral other Princes of the <hi>Empire.</hi> It is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that in Three Years War againſt the <hi>Confederates,</hi> his moſt <hi>Chriſtian Majeſty</hi> has not only ſtood his ground, without loſing ſo much as one Inch of his Ancient Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, but actually and almoſt without Oppoſition, taken ſeveral Towns, and ſome entire Provinces, from the Principals of the <hi>Confederacy;</hi> And made himſelf almoſt as conſiderable at Sea, as he is at Land; Not only in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> and upon the Coaſts of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> but in <hi>America</hi> too: where he has laid a Foundation of great Miſchief both to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> in the point of Commerce; if not timely prevented. And he does little leſs by his Money, than by his Arms; for he pays all, and with <hi>French</hi> Money, under pretext of Neutrality, maintains conſiderable Armies in the very heart of the <hi>Empire;</hi> which, 'tis feared, will be ready enough upon any diſtaſter, to joyn with the Common Enemy. It is the <hi>French</hi> Court that manages the Counſels of <hi>Poland,</hi> and they govern the <hi>Swiſſe</hi> no leſs; who, by the Conqueſt of the <hi>Franche County</hi> are made little better then ſlaves. And yet by a fatal Blindneſs that <hi>Republick</hi> ſtill furniſhes the <hi>French</hi> with the beſt of their Soldiers, and helps forward the Deſtruction of <hi>Europe,</hi> never dreaming that they themſelves are to be undone too at laſt.</p>
            <p>But it is no great matter, you'l ſay, to impoſe upon the <hi>Swiſſe</hi> (which are a heavy and Phlegmatick People) but the <hi>French</hi> Charms have bewitch'd even <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelf; though a Nation the moſt Clear-ſighted, and ſuſpicious of all others. For their <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi> lie as quiet, as if they were aſleep; though the Fire is already kindled in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and the Danger brought home to their own Doors. It is a wonder, that they lay things no more to heart, conſidering, Firſt, the Paſſages the <hi>French</hi> have to favour their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Secondly, That they are many and ſmall States, weak, and eaſily to be corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if not ſo already. Thirdly, that though they have been formerly very brave, and many particulars remain ſo ſtill, yet in the generality they are ſoft and effeminate. And Fourthly, that the <hi>French</hi> is there the Maſter of the Seas. Theſe Reflections methinks might convince any Man of the Condition they are in. And certainly they that were not able to defend themſelves againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth, will be much leſs able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter <hi>Lewis</hi> the 14th: Or if he gets in, to drive him out again, as they did the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For they muſt do it wholly upon their own Strength, having only the <hi>Turk</hi> in Condition to help them. For <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> are ſunk already; And the <hi>Swiſſe</hi> will neither dare to venture upon't, nor are they able to do it, if they had a mind tot.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Spain,</hi> it is neither Populous, nor fortifi'd, and perhaps want of Proviſions may keep it from an Invaſion. And yet for all that with a Body of Thirty or Forty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men by the way of <hi>Fontaraby,</hi> and as many by <hi>Catalonia,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> may (if they pleaſe) in two <hi>Campania's</hi> make themſelves Maſters of <hi>Navarre, Arragon, Catalonia,</hi> and <hi>Valentia:</hi> and then it is but fortifying the Frontiers, and making his <hi>Catholick Majeſty</hi> a Tributary in <hi>Caſtile;</hi> Who muſt content himſelf to take what they pleaſe to give him, over and above, in conſideration of his Dominions in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Indies: A Poſſibility that</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Holland <hi>ſhall do well to think of: For when he has the</hi> Mines <hi>in his Power, and</hi> Europe <hi>under his Feet, there will be no contending.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, they have only the <hi>Swiſſe</hi> or the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to fall upon next: For the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, they are neither fortified nor united in Affections or Religion.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>England;</hi> They are a People not naturally addicted to the <hi>French,</hi> ſenſible of their Honour, and of their Intereſt, and the whole World is convinced of their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. They are United under the Government of a Gracious Prince; and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns are at this Inſtant lodged in the hands of the moſt Loyal and Publick-ſpirited Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives that ever acted in that Station; beſide the Strength of the Iſland by Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: So that the <hi>French</hi> would find it a hard matter, either to make a Conqueſt here, or if they ſhould ſurprize it, to keep it. But yet they have finer Ways to Victory than by Force of Arms; and their <hi>Gold</hi> has done them better Service than their <hi>Iron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What have we now to do then, but in a Common Cauſe, to arm againſt a Common Oppreſſion? This is the time, or never, for <hi>Italy</hi> to enter into a League for their Common Safety, and not only to keep, but, if poſſible, to force the <hi>French</hi> from their Borders; while the <hi>Imperial</hi> Army holds the Capital Power of <hi>France</hi> in Play?</p>
            <pb n="66" facs="tcp:48501:38"/>
            <p>And this is the time too, for the <hi>Swiſſe</hi> to recal all their Troops out of the <hi>French</hi> Service, and to ſtrike a general League alſo for the Recovery of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> the only Outwork of their Liberties, and to expel the <hi>French</hi> Garriſons, and deliver the places into the hands of the Right Owners.</p>
            <p>And will it not concern <hi>Poland</hi> as much as any of the reſt; that ſtands and falls with the <hi>Empire,</hi> as the Defence of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> and whoſe own turn is next.</p>
            <p>This Alarm methinks ſhould call off the Princes from the Acquiſitions they have made upon part of the <hi>Swedes</hi> Poſſeſſions in the Empire, to the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Netherlands;</hi> and make all the <hi>French</hi> Mercenaries in the Empire, to bethink them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of returning from the Deluſions which either the <hi>French</hi> Artifice or Money has impoſed upon them. He that has no regard for the Head, will have leſs for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendences, when he has them at his Mercy.</p>
            <p>Nay the very <hi>French</hi> themſelves ſhould do well to contemplate the Slavery that is now prepar'd for them. Their Laws and Liberties are trampled upon; and <hi>till the</hi> French <hi>Government be reduc'd to the Bounds of its Ancient Conſtitution, neither the People, nor their Neighbours, can ever be ſecure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this dangerous Criſis of Affairs, it has pleas'd Divine Providence to leave <hi>England</hi> the Arbitreſs of the Fate of <hi>Europe;</hi> and to annex ſuch advantages to the Office, that the Honour, the Duty, and Security of this Nation ſeem to be wrapt up together. In the Point of Honour, what can be more Generous, than to ſuccour the Miſerable and the Oppreſs'd, and to put a ſtop to that Torrent that threatens <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> with an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Deluge? Beſide the Vindication of our ſelves for thoſe Affronts and Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, both Publick and Private, that we have ſuffer'd upon our own Account. And then in matter of Duty: It is not only Chriſtendom, but <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> itſelf, that lies at ſtake. For in the Ruine of the <hi>Empire,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> work is done to his hand, by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the only Fence that has preſerv'd us all this while from the Incurſions of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Power. Now as nothing can be more glorious than at all hazards, to hinder the effuſion of more Chriſtian Blood, and to ſave Chriſtendom itſelf from Bondage; it is ſo much our Intereſt too, that we our ſelves are loſt without it. And as the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is reciprocal, ſo the Reſolution is neceſſary: The choice we have before us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only this, <hi>Either to unite with our Neighbours for a Common Safety, or to ſtand ſtill and look on, the tame Spectators of their Ruine, till we fall alone.</hi> This is ſo demonſtrative, that if we do not by a powerful Alliance and Diverſion, prevent the Conqueſt of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> (which lies already a gaſping) we are cut off from all Communication with the reſt of <hi>Europe,</hi> and coop'd up at home, to the irrecoverable loſs of our Reputation and Commerce; for <hi>Holland</hi> muſt inevitably follow the Fate of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and then the <hi>French</hi> are Maſters of the Sea; Ravage our Plantations, and infallibly poſſeſs themſelves of the <hi>Spaniſh Indies,</hi> and leave us anſwerable for all thoſe Calamities that ſhall enſue upon it: which as yet, by God's Providence, may be timely prevented. But <hi>he that ſtills the raging of the Sea, will undoubtedly ſet Bounds to this overflowing Greatneſs:</hi> having now, (as an Earneſt of that Mercy) put it into the Hearts of our Superiours to provide ſeaſonably for the Common Safety, and in proportion alſo to the Exigence of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair; knowing very well, that things of this Nature are not to be done by halves.</p>
            <p>We have to do with a Nation of a large Territory; abounding in Men and Money; their Dominion is grown abſolute, that no Man there can call any thing his own, if the Court ſays <hi>Nay</hi> to't. So that the ſober and induſtrious part, are only Slaves to the Luſts and Ambition of the Military. In this Condition of Servitude, they feel already what their Neighbours fear, and wiſh as well to any Opportunity, either of avoiding, or of caſting off the Yoke: which will eaſily be given by a Conjunction of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> at Sea: and almoſt infallibly produce theſe effects: <hi>First,</hi> It will draw off the Naval Force of <hi>France</hi> from <hi>Sicily, America,</hi> and elſe-where, to attend this Expedition. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Diverſion will be an Eaſe to the <hi>Empire</hi> and the <hi>Confederates,</hi> from whence more Troops muſt be drawn to encounter this Difficulty, than the <hi>French</hi> can well ſpare. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It will not only encourage thoſe Princes and States that are already engag'd, but likewiſe keep in awe thoſe that are diſaffected, and confirm thoſe that waver.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, this War muſt needs be prodigiouſly expenſive; but then in probability it will be ſhort: And in Caſes of this Quality, People muſt do as in a Storm at Sea, rather throw part of the Lading over-board, than founder the Veſſel. I do not ſpeak this, as ſuppoſing any difficulty in the Caſe, for the very contemplation of it has put fire into the Veins of every true <hi>Engliſh-man;</hi> and they are moved as by a ſacred im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, to the neceſſary, and the only means of their Preſervation. And that which Crowns our hopes, is, that theſe generous Inclinations are only ready to execute what
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48501:38"/>the Wiſdom of their Superiours ſhall find reaſonable to Command. I need not tell you how jealous the People of <hi>England</hi> are of their Religion and Liberties; to what degree they have contended, even for the ſhadow of theſe Intereſts; nor how much Blood and Treaſure they have ſpent upon the Quarrel. Could any Impoſture work ſo much; and can any Man imagine that they will be now leſs ſenſible, when they ſee before their eyes a manifeſt Plot upon their Religion; their Liberties invaded, their Traffick interrupted; the Honour, and the very Being of their Country at ſtake; their Wives and Children expos'd to Beggary and Scorn; and in Concluſion, <hi>The Priviledge of a Free-born</hi> Engliſh-man <hi>exchanged for the Vaſſalage of</hi> France?</p>

Whereto all the Juſtices anſwered, That they had conferred thereof before, and held it to be lawful, becauſe the King hath the Supreme Eccleſiaſtical Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which he hath delegated to the Commiſſioners, whereby they had the Power of Deprivation by the Canon-Law of the Realm. And the Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points Commiſſioners to be made by the Queen, doth not confer any new Power, but explain and declare the Ancient Power. And therefore they held it clear, <hi>That the King without Parliament might make Orders and Conſtitutions for the Government of the Clergy, and might deprive them if they obeyed not. And ſo the Commiſſioners might deprive them.</hi> But they could not make any Conſtitutions without the King: And the divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of ſuch Ordinances by Proclamation is a moſt gracious Admonition: And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they have refuſed to obey, they are lawfully deprived by the Commiſſioners <hi>ex Officio,</hi> without Libel <hi>Et ore tenus convocati.</hi> Secondly, Whether a Prohibition be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48501:39"/>grantable againſt the Commiſſioners upon the Statute of 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. if they do not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Copy of the Libel to the Party; Whereto they all anſwered, That that Statute is intended where the Eccleſiaſtical Judge proceeds <hi>ex Officio &amp; ore tenus.</hi> Thirdly, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were an Offence puniſhable, and what Puniſhment they deſerved, who framed Petitions, and collected a multitude of hands thereto, to prefer to the King in a publick cauſe, as the Puritans had done, with an intimation to the King, That if he denied their Sute, many thouſands of his Subjects would be diſcontented? Whereto all the Juſtices an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That it was an Offence finable at Diſcretion, and very near to <hi>Treaſon and Felony in the Puniſhment:</hi> For they tended to the raiſing of Sedition, Rebellion, and Diſcontent among the People: To which Reſolution all the Lords agreed. And then many of the Lords declared, That ſome of the Puritans had raiſed a falſe Rumor of the King, how he intended to grant a Toleration to Papiſts: Which Offence the Juſtices conceived to be heinouſly finable by the Rules of the Common Law, either in the Kings Bench, <hi>or by the King and his Councel;</hi> or now ſince the Statute of 3 <hi>H.</hi> 7. in the Star-Chamber. And the Lords ſeverally declared how the King was diſcontented with the ſaid falſe Rumor, and had made but the Day before a Proteſtation unto them, that he never intended it, and that he would ſpend the laſt drop of Bloud in his Body before he would do it; and prayed, that before any of his Iſſue ſhould main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any other Religion than what he truly profeſſed and maintained, that God would take them out of the World.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but yourſelf, and every <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtant, will joyn with this Royal Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner, and will heartily ſay <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you deſire to know if I think the Reſolution of the Judges in this caſe ought to deter us from humbly Petitioning his Majeſty, that this Parliament may effectually ſit on the 26th. day of <hi>January</hi> next. In order to this, give me leave to obſerve to you, As it is moſt certain, that a great Reverence is due to the Unanimous Opinion of all the Judges, ſo there is a great difference to be put between the Authority of their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments when ſolemnly given in Caſes depending before them, and their ſudden and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trajudicial Opinions. The Caſe of Ship-money it ſelf, is not a better proof of this, than that which you have now read, as you will now ſee, if you conſider diſtinctly what they ſay to the ſeveral Queſtions propoſed to them.</p>
            <p>As to their Anſwer to the firſt Queſtion, it much concerns the Reverend Clergy to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whither they did not miſtake in it? And whether the King by his Proclamation, can make new conſtitutions, and oblige them to obedience under the Penalty of Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? Should it be ſo, and ſhould this unhappy Kingdom ever ſuffer under the Reign of a Popiſh Prince, he might eaſily rid himſelf of ſuch obſtinate Hereticks, and leave his Eccleſiaſtical Preferments open for Men of better Principles: He will need only to publiſh a Proclamation, that Spittle and Salt ſhould be uſed in Baptiſm, that Holy-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould be uſed, and Images ſet up in Churches; and a few more ſuch things as theſe, and the Buſineſs were effectually done. But if you will believe my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Cook,</hi>
               <note place="margin">12. <hi>Co.</hi> 19. 12. <hi>Co.</hi> 49.</note> he will tell you that it was agreed by all the Judges upon Debate. <hi>Hill.</hi> 4to <hi>Jacobi,</hi> that the King cannot change his Eccleſiaſtical Law; and you may eaſily remember ſince the whole Parliament declared, That he could not alter or ſuſpend them.</p>
            <p>I have the uniform Opinion of all the Judges given upon great Deliberation,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Co. Mag. Char.</hi> 616.</note> 
               <hi>Mich.</hi> 4to. <hi>Jac.</hi> to juſtifie me, if I ſay that our Judges here were utterly miſtaken in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer which they gave to the ſecond Queſtion, I will not cite the numerous ſubſequent Authorities, ſince every man knows that it is the conſtant practice of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> at this Day to grant Prohibitions, upon refuſal to give a Copy of Articles, where the Proceedings in the Eccleſiaſtical Courts are <hi>ex Officio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee there was a kind of ill Fate upon the Judges this day, as uſually there was when met in the Star-chamber, and that they were very unfortunate in anſwering two of the three Queſtions propoſed to them; let us go on to conſider what does principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern us at preſent, their Anſwer to the laſt Queſtion.</p>
            <p>You have juſt done reading it, and therefore I need not repeat to you either the Doubt or the Solution of it; but one may be allowed to ſay modeſtly, that it was a ſudden Anſwer: 'Tis poſſible the Lords then preſent were well enough inform'd, when they were told that ſuch kind of Petitioning was an Offence next to Treaſon and Felony; but I dare be ſo bold as to ſay, That at this Day, not a Lawyer in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> would be the wiſer for ſuch an Anſwer; they would be confounded, and not know whether it were Miſpriſion of Treaſon, which ſeems an Offence neareſt to Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or Petty-larceny, which ſeems neareſt to Felony.</p>
            <p>You will be apt to tell me that I miſtake my Lords the Judges, and they ſpoke not of the nature of the crime, but the manner of the Puniſhment; but this will mend the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48501:39"/>matter but little; for ſince the Puniſhments of thoſe two Crimes are ſo very different, you are ſtill as much in the dark as ever, what theſe ambiguous words mean.</p>
            <p>Well, but we will agree, that the Crime about which the Enquiry was made, was a very great one. When Men arrive to ſuch Inſolence, as to threaten their Prince, it will be but little excuſe to them to call their Menaces, by the ſoft and gentle Name of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions.</p>
            <p>But you would know for what, and in what manner we are at preſent to Petition;
<note place="margin">13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 5</note> and I will give you a plain and infallible Rule. It is the Statute 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>Be it enacted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that no perſon or perſons whatſoever, ſhall ſolicite, labour, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the getting of hands, or other conſent of any perſons above the number of twenty, or more, to any Petition, Complaint, Remonſtance, Declaration, or other Addreſſes to the King, or both, or either Houſes of Parliament, for alteration of matters eſtabliſhed by Law in Church or State, unleſs the matter thereof have been firſt conſented to, and ordered by three or more Juſtices of the County, or by the major part of the Grand Jury of the County, or Diviſion of the County, where the ſame matter ſhall ariſe at their publick Aſſizes, or General Quarter-Seſſions, or if ariſing in <hi>London,</hi> by the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons in Common Council aſſembled; and that no perſon or perſons whatſoever ſhall repair to His Majeſty, or both, or either of the Houſes of Parliament, upon Pretence of preſenting or delivering any Petition, Complaint, Remonſtrance, or Declaration, or other Addreſſes, accompanied with exceſſive Number of People, not at any one time with above the Number of ten Perſons, upon the Pain of incurring a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, not exceeding the Sum of 100 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> in Money, and Three Months Impriſonment, without Bail or Mainprize for every Offence; which Offence to be proſecuted at the Court of <hi>Kings-bench,</hi> or at the Aſſizes, or general Quarter-Seſſions, within ſix Months after the Offence committed, and proved by two or more credible Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>Here you obſerve the Parliament, who ſet themſelves directly to obviate all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences which might ariſe to the Government from tumultuous petitioning, will not allow that great Numbers ſhould joyn in Petitions, for alteration of the Laws (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is poſſible ill Men ſhould abuſe ſuch Liberty) unleſs the matter of the Petition be con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ted to in ſuch a manner as the Act directs; but in all other Caſes they leave the Subjects to their undoubted Liberty, as well knowing that from thence there could ariſe no poſſible Inconvenience; but on the contrary, that to bar the People of that humble way of making their Wants known, might force them upon worſe ways of doing it.</p>
            <p>And therefore I muſt tell you, that you do my Lord Chancellor great Injuſtice if you think his Speech tends to deter Men from all manner of petitioning: No, that wiſe and eloquent Lord, who receives every day ſo many Petitions, will I ſuppoſe be content the King ſhould receive ſome too. It never yet was thought

               </note> ſeditious or tumultuous in any Government, for the Subjects in an humble manner to beg, That he who has the only Power to do it, would redreſs their Grievances: 'Tis the way by which we apply our ſelves to the King of Heaven, who knows all our Wants, and yet expects from us that we ſhould daily expreſs them to him in humble Petitions. And the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Church, which has appointed Liturgies, and Forms of Common-Prayer ſeems to inſtruct us, that God is pleaſed when huge Numbers joyn in the ſame Petition. Why ſhould not then ſuppliant Subjects, with like Humility, and in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner addreſs themſelves to the God on Earth? Eſpecially ſince Kings cannot know our Deſires, or our Grievances, till we our ſelves inform them what they are. I remember ſome wicked Councellors of <hi>Darius</hi> did once obtain a Law to be made, that none ſhould Petition any one but the King for thirty Days; but there never yet was found ſo abſurd a States-man as to adviſe a Law, that Subjects ſhould not ſupplicate their Prince. 'Tis probable it would be well for ſome Favourites, who are near a King, if ſuch a Right could be taken from the People, for then all their falſe Suggeſtions and Informations might paſs undiſcovered; but 'tis impoſſible that a King ſhould long be ſafe in ſuch a Condition. I will ſuppoſe a malicious States-man, intending to raiſe a Jealouſie in the Mind of the Sovereign, ſhould inform him in dangerous times, that he was not beloved by his People, and that he was not to truſt them: How could the Subjects in ſuch a Caſe recover the Prince's good Opinion, in the Abſence of a Legal Repreſentative, but by humble and affectionate Addreſſes? Or ſuppoſe ſome good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Prince ſhould be ſo unfortunate, as to have ſome Councellors near him who are conceal'd; and others, whoſe Crimes make them fear Parliaments; it is eaſie to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48501:40"/>that the one ſort will be filling his Ears with Stories, that a great part of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are inclined to Popery; and the other ſort, that the beſt of his Subjects are quite out of Love with Parliaments, as factious and ſeditious Aſſemblies. Into what unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Circumſtances, would ſuch a Prince be apt to fall, if his People were perclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from Addreſſing themſelves, and opening their Deſires to him!</p>
            <p>I might go on to trouble you with infinite Inſtances of this Nature, but there is no want of any in ſo plain a caſe: 'Tis the Doctrine of our Church, that the only Arms of Subjects, are Prayers, Petitions, Supplications and Tears; and they are no Friends either to the King or Church,

            <p>King <hi>James</hi> by a Proclamation publiſht in the 12th. year of his Reign, begins thus: <q>The Complaints lately exhibited to us by certain Noblemen, and others of our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſuggeſting Diſorders and Abuſes, as well in the Proceedings of the late begun Parliament, as in the Martial and Civil Government of the Kingdom, We did receive with extraordinary Grace and Favour.</q>

            <p>'Tis time for me to conclude your trouble: I ſuppoſe you do no longer doubt but that you may joyn in Petition for a Parliament, ſince you ſee it has been often done heretofore: nor need you fear how many of your honeſt Countreymen joyn with you, ſince you hear of Petitions by the whole Body of the Realm; and ſince you ſee, both by the Opinions of our Lawyers, by the Doctrine of our Church, and by the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Kings, That it is our undoubted Right to Petition. Nothing can be more
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48501:40"/>abſurd than to ſay, That the number of the Supplicants makes an innocent Petition an Offence; on the contrary, if in a thing of this Publick concernment, a few only ſhould addreſs themſelves to the King, it would be a thing in it ſelf ridiculous; the great end of ſuch Addreſſes being to acquaint him with the general deſires of his People, which can never be done unleſs multitudes joyn. How can the Complaints of the diffuſive Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Realm reach his Majeſty's Ears in the abſence of a Parliament, but in the actual concurrence of every individual Perſon in Petition? for the perſonal application of multitudes, is indeed unlawful and dangerous.</p>

I do not know how well what I have to ſay may be received, for I never ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy either to make my Court well, or to be Popular; I always ſpeak what I am commanded by the Dictates of the Spirit within me.</p>
            <p>There are ſome other Conſiderations that concern <hi>England</hi> ſo nearly, that without them you will come far ſhort of Safety and Quiet at Home: <hi>We have a little Siſter, and ſhe hath no Breaſts, what ſhall we do for our Siſter in the day when ſhe ſhall be ſpoken for? If ſhe be a Wall, we will build on her a Palace of Silver, if ſhe be a Door, we will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe her with Boards of Cedar.</hi> We have ſeveral little Siſters without Breaſts, the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtant Churches, the two Kingdoms of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> The Foreign Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants are a Wall, the only Wall and Defence to <hi>England;</hi> upon it you may build Palaces of Silver, glorious Palaces. The Protection of the Proteſtants abroad, is the greateſt Power and Security the Crown of <hi>England</hi> can attain to, and which can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly help us to give Check to the growing Greatneſs of <hi>France. Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> are two Doors, either to let in Good or Miſchief upon us; they are much weakened by the Artifice of our cunning Enemies, and we ought to incloſe them with Boards of Cedar.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi> like two Siſters, go hand in hand, ſometimes one goes firſt, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the other in a doors, but the other is always following cloſe at hand.</p>
            <p>In <hi>England, Popery</hi> was to have brought in <hi>Slavery;</hi> in <hi>Scotland, Slavery</hi> went before, and <hi>Popery</hi> was to follow.</p>
            <p>I do not think your Lordſhips or the Parliament have Juriſdiction there. It is a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Ancient Kingdom; they have an illuſtrious Nobility, a Gallant Gentry, a Learned Clergy, and an Underſtanding, Worthy People; but yet we cannot think of <hi>England</hi> as we ought, without reflecting on the Condition therein. They are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame Prince, and the Influence of the ſame Favourites and Councils; when
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48501:41"/>they are hardly dealt with, can we that are the Richer expect better uſage? for 'tis certain, that in all Abſolute Governments, the pooreſt Countreys are always moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably dealt with.</p>
            <p>When the Ancient Nobility and Gentry there cannot enjoy their Royalties, their Shrevaldoms, and their Stewardaries which they and their Anceſtors have poſſeſſed for ſeveral hundreds of years; but that now they are enjoyned by the Lords of the Council to make Deputations of their Authorities to ſuch as are their known Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>Can we expect to enjoy our <hi>Magna Charta</hi> long under the ſame Perſons, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Affairs? If the Council-Table there can Impriſon any Nobleman or Gentleman for ſeveral years, without bringing him to Trial, or giving the leaſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for what they do; can we expect the ſame Men will preſerve the Liberty of the Subject here?</p>
            <p>I will acknowledge, I am not well vers'd in the particular Laws of <hi>Scotland;</hi> but this I do know, that all the <hi>Nothern</hi> Countries have, by their Laws an undoubted and inviolable Right to their Liberties and Properties; yet <hi>Scotland</hi> hath out-done all the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Southern</hi> Countries, in having their Lives, Liberties and Eſtates ſubjected to the Arbitrary Will and Pleaſure of thoſe that Govern. They have late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plundered and harraſſed the richeſt and wealthieſt Countries of that Kingdom, and brought down the Barbarous <hi>Highlanders</hi> to devour them; and all this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out almoſt a colourable Pretence to do it: Nor can there be found a Reaſon of State for what they have done; but that thoſe wicked Miniſters deſigned to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Rebellion at any Rate, which as they managed, was only prevented by the miraculous Hand of God, or otherwiſe all the Papiſts in <hi>England</hi> would have been Armed, and the faireſt Opportunity given in the juſt time for the Execution of that Wicked and Bloudy Deſign the Papiſts had; and it is not poſſible for any Man that duly conſiders it, to think other, but that thoſe Miniſters that Acted that, were as guilty of the Plot, as any of the Lords that are in queſtion for it.</p>
            <p>My Lords, I am forced to ſpeak this the plainer, becauſe, till the Preſſure be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and clearly taken off from <hi>Scotland,</hi> 'tis not poſſible for me, or any Thinking Man to believe that Good is meant us here.</p>
            <p>We muſt ſtill be upon our Guard, apprehending that the Principle is not chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at Court, and that theſe Men that are ſtill in Place and Authority, have that Influence upon the Mind of our Excellent Prince, that he is not, nor cannot be that to us, that his own Nature and Goodneſs would incline him to.</p>
            <p>I know your Lordſhips can order nothing in this, but there are thoſe that hear me, can put a perfect Cure to it; until that be done, the <hi>Scottiſh Weed</hi> is like Death in the Pot, <hi>Mors in Olla;</hi> But there is ſomething too, now I conſider, that moſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately concerns us; their Act of Twenty two thouſand Men to be ready to invade us upon all Occaſions. This, I hear, that the Lords of the Council there have treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as they do all other Laws, and expounded it into a ſtanding Army of Six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men. I am ſure we have Reaſon and Right to beſeech the King that that Act may be better conſidered in the next Parliament there. I ſhall ſay no more for <hi>Scotland</hi> at this time, I am afraid your Lordſhips will think I have ſaid too much, having no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern there; But if a <hi>French</hi> Noble-Man ſhould come to dwell in my Houſe and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, I ſhould think it concern'd me to ask what he did in <hi>France:</hi> for if he were there a Felon, a Rogue, a Plunderer, I ſhould deſire him to live elſewhere; and I hope your Lordſhips will do the ſame thing for the Nation, if you find the ſame cauſe.</p>
            <p>My Lords, give me leave to ſpeak two or three Words concerning our other Siſter <hi>Ireland:</hi> thither, I hear, is ſent <hi>Douglas</hi>'s Regiment, to ſecure us againſt the <hi>French.</hi> Beſides, I am credibly informed, that the Papiſts have their Arms reſtored, and the Proteſtants are not many of them yet recovered from being the ſuſpected Party; the Sea-Towns as well as the In-land, are full of Papiſts: That Kingdom cannot long continue in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hands, if ſome better Care be not taken of it. This is in your Power, and there is nothing there, but is under your Laws; therefore I beg that this Kingdom at leaſt may be taken in conſideration, together with the State of <hi>England:</hi> For I am ſure there can be no Safety here, if theſe Doors be not ſhut up and made ſure.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I AM very ſenſible of the great Honour you were pleas'd to do me in your laſt, which I received immediately after our late unhappy Diſſolution; but could have wiſhed you would have laid your Commands on ſome more able Perſon, to have given you Satisfaction in the matter you there propoſe relating to the Duke, who, you ſeem to inſinuate, was like (if the Parliament had continued) to have received hard meaſure. I muſt ingeniouſly confeſs to you, I was not long ſince perfectly of your Opinion, and thought it the higheſt Injuſtice imaginable, for any Prince to be debar'd of his Native Right of Succeſſion upon any pretence whatſoever. But upon a more mature Deliberation and Enquiry, I found my Error proceeded principally from the falſo Notions I had took up of Government it ſelf, and from my Ignorance of the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> of all Communities of Men in all Ages, whenever Self-preſervation and Neceſſity of their Affairs obliged them to declare their Opinion in Caſes of the like Nature: To the knowledge of all which, the following Accident I ſhall relate to you, did very much contribute.</p>
            <p>My Occaſions obliging me one day to attend the coming of a Friend in a Coffee-houſe near <hi>Charing-Croſs,</hi> there happened to ſit at the ſame Table with me Two Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Gentlemen, who according to the Frankneſs of Converſation now uſed in the Town, began a Diſcourſe on the ſame Subject you deſire to be more particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in; and having Extolled the late Houſe of Commons as the beſt number of Men that had ever ſate within thoſe Walls; and that no Houſe had ever more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly maintained and aſſerted <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberty and Proteſtant Religion, than they had done, as far as the nature of the things that came before them, and the Circumſtances of time would admit (to all which I very readily and heartily aſſented;) they then added, That the great Wiſdom and Zeal of that Houſe had appeared in nothing more, than in Ordering a Bill to be brought in for debarring the Duke of <hi>Y.</hi> from inheriting the Crown<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A Law they affirmed to be the moſt juſt and reaſonable in the World, and the only proper Remedy to eſtabliſh this Nation on a true and ſolid Intereſt, both Relation to the preſent and future Times.</p>
            <p>To which I could not but Reply, That I begged their Pardon if I differed from them in Opinion; and did believe, that how honeſtly ſoever the Houſe of Commons might intend in that matter, yet that the point of Succeſſion was ſo Sacred a thing, and of ſo high a Nature, that it was not ſubjected to their Cognizance: That Monarchy was of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48501:43"/>Divine Right: That Princes ſucceeded by Nature and Generation only, and not by Authority, Admiſſion, or Approbation of the People; and conſequently, that neither the Merit or Demerit of their Perſons, nor the different influences from thence upon the People, were to be reſpected or had in conſideration; but the Common-wealth ought to obey and Submit to the next Heir, without any further Inquiſition; and if he proved a Worthy, Vertuous, and Juſt Prince, it was a great Happineſs; if Unjuſt, Barbarous, and Tyrannical, there was no other Remedy, but Prayer, Patience and an intire Submiſſion to ſo difficult a Diſpenſation of Gods Providence.</p>
            <p>I had no ſooner ended my Diſcourſe, but one of the Gentlemen (that was the moſt ſerious in the Company) ſeeing me a Young Man, gravely Replied; That he could not but be extreamly concerned to hear that ſuch pernicious Notions againſt all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Government, had been taught in the World: That he believed they were in me purely the Effects of an Univerſity-Education; and that it had been my Misfortune to have had a very high Church-man for my Tutor, who had endeavoured (as it was their conſtant Practice to all Young Gentlemen under their Care) to debauch me with ſuch Principles as would enſlave my mind to their Hierarchy, and the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical part of the Government, without any Regard at all to the Ariſtocratical and Popular; and that fat Parſonages, Prebendſhips, Deanaries, and Epiſcopal Sees, were the certain and conſtant Rewards of ſuch Services: That the Place we were in, was a little too Publick for Diſcourſes of this Nature; but if I would accept of a Bottle of Wine at the next Tavern, he would undertake to give me juſter meaſures; adding it was pity ſo hopeful a Gentleman ſhould be tainted with bad Principles. My Friend coming in at the ſame Time, proved to be one of their particular Acquaintance; and both he and I readily complied with ſo generous a motion.</p>
            <p>We had no ſooner drank a Glaſs round, but the Old Gentleman was pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new his Diſcourſe, and ſaid it was undoubtedly true, that the inclination of Mankind to live in Company (from whence come Towns, Cities, and Common-wealths) did proceed of Nature, and conſequently of God the Author of Nature: So likewiſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and the Jurisdiction of Magiſtrates in general (which does neceſſarily flow from the living together in Society) is alſo of Nature, and ordained by God for the common Good of Mankind; but that the particular Species and Forms of this or that Government, in this or that manner; To have many, few, or one Governour; or that they ſhould have this or that Authority, more or leſs, for a longer, or a ſhorter time; or whether ordinarily by Succeſſion or by Election: All theſe things (he ſaid) are Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and Diverſified by the particular poſitive Laws of every Country, and are not Eſtabliſh'd either by Law Natural or Divine, but left by God unto every Nation and Country, to pitch upon what Form of Government they ſhall think moſt proper to promote the common good of the whole, and beſt adapted to the Natures, Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and other Circumſtances of the People; which accordingly for the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be altered or amended in any of its parts, by the mutual Conſent of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours and Governed, whenever they ſhall ſee reaſonable cauſe ſo to do; all which appears plainly, both from the diverſity of Governments extant in the World, and by the ſame Nations living ſometimes under one ſort of Government, and ſometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another. So we ſee God himſelf permitted his peculiar People the <hi>Jews</hi> to live under divers Forms of Government; as Firſt, under Patriarchs, then under Captains, then under Judges, then under High-Prieſts, next under Kings, and then under Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains and High-Prieſts again, until they were conquered by the <hi>Romans,</hi> who them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alſo firſt lived under Kings, and then Conſuls, whoſe Authority they afterwards limitted by a Senate, by adding Tribunes of the People; and in extraordinary Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of the Commonwealth they were governed by Dictators, and laſt of all by Emperors. So that it's plain no Magiſtrate has his particular Government, or an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Succeſſion in it, by any Inſtitution of Nature, but only by the particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Commonwealth within it ſelf. And as the kinds of Government are different, ſo alſo are the meaſures of Power and Authority in the ſame kind, in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Countries.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin, (ſaid he) with that of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which though it be the firſt in Dignity among Chriſtian Princes, yet it is ſo reſtrained and limited by the particular Laws of the Empire, that he can do much leſs in his State, than other Kings in theirs. He can neither make War, nor exact any Contribution of Men or Money, but by the Conſent of all the States of the <hi>German</hi> Diet: And as for his Children and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they have no Intereſt or Pretence to ſucceed, but only by Election, if they ſhall be thought worthy. Nay, the chiefeſt Article the Emperour ſwears to keep at his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to that Honour, is, That he ſhall never endeavour to make the Dignity of the Empire Hereditary to his Family.</p>
            <pb n="78" facs="tcp:48501:44"/>
            <p>In <hi>Spain</hi> and in <hi>France,</hi> the Priviledges of Kings are much more eminent, both in Power and Succeſſion; their Authority is more abſolute, every Order of theirs having the Validity of a Law, and their next of Bloud does ordinarily inherit, though in a different manner. In <hi>Spain</hi> the next Heir cannot ſucceed but by the Approbation of the Nobility, Biſhops, and States of the Realm. In <hi>France</hi> the Women are not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſucceed, let them be never ſo lineally deſcended. In <hi>England</hi> our Kings are much more limited and confined in their Power, than either of the two former; for here no Law can be made but by Conſent and Authority of Parliament; and as to the Point of Succeſſion, the next of kin is admitted, unleſs in extraordinary Caſes, and when important Reaſon of State require an Alteration: And then the Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> (according to the ancient Laws and Statutes of the Realm) have frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly directed and appointed the Succeſſion of the Crown in other manner than in courſe it would have gone; of which I ſhall give you ſome Examples in Order.</p>
            <p>But firſt let us look abroad, and ſee how things have been carried as to this Point in other Countries.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> the Law of Succeſſion did ordinarily hold; and accordingly <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam</hi> the Lawful Son and Heir of <hi>Solomon,</hi> after his Fathers Deceaſe, went to <hi>Sichem</hi> to be crowned and admitted by the People; and the whole Body of the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> being there gathered together, did (before they would admit him their lawful King) make unto him certain propoſitions for taking away ſome heavy Taxes that had been impoſed on them by his Father <hi>Solomon,</hi> which he refuſing to gratifie them in, and following the Advice of Young Men, Ten of the twelve Tribes immediately choſe <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> a Servant of <hi>Rehoboham</hi>'s, a meer Stanger, and of mean Parentage, and made him their King; and God approved thereof, as the Scriptures in expreſs Words do teſtifie: For when <hi>Rehoboam</hi> had raiſed an Army of One hundred and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore thouſand Men, intending by force of Arms to have juſtified his Claim, God appeared unto <hi>Semaiah,</hi> and commanded him to go to <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and to the Houſe of <hi>Jadah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Return every man to his houſe, for this thing is of me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> So that ſince God did permit and allow this in his own Commonwealth, which was to be the Pattern for all others, no doubt he will approve the ſame in other Kingdoms, whenever his Service and Glory, or the Happineſs of the Weal-publick ſhall require it.</p>
            <p>The next inſtance, I ſhall give you, ſhall be in <hi>Spain,</hi> where <hi>Don Alonſo de la Cerda</hi> having been admitted Prince of <hi>Spain</hi> in his Father's Life-time (according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of that Realm) married <hi>Blanoha</hi> Daughter of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Firſt King of <hi>France,</hi> and had by her two Sons Named <hi>Alonſo</hi> and <hi>Hernando de la Cerda;</hi> but their Father (who was only Prince) dying before <hi>Alonſo</hi> the Ninth then King, he recommended them to the Realm as lawful Heirs apparent to the Crown: But <hi>Don Sancho</hi> their Fathers Younger Brother, who was a great Warrier, and Sirnamed <hi>El Bravo,</hi> was admitted Prince, and they, put by, in their Grandfathers Life-time, by his and the States Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and this was done at a Parliament held at <hi>Sagovia,</hi> in the Year 1276. And in the Year 1284, (<hi>Alonſo</hi> the Ninth being dead) <hi>Don Sancho</hi> was aknowledg'd King, and the Two Princes Impriſoned; but at the Mediation of <hi>Philip</hi> the Third, King of <hi>France,</hi> their Unkle, they were ſet free, and Endowed with conſiderable Revenues in Land, and from them do deſcend the Dukes <hi>De Medina Celi</hi> at this Day; and the preſent King of <hi>Spain</hi> that is in Poſſeſſion, deſcendeth from <hi>Don Sancho.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>France, Lewis</hi> the Fourth, had Two Sons, <hi>Lothairin,</hi> who ſucceeded him, and <hi>Charles</hi> whom he made Duke of <hi>Lorrain. Lothairin</hi> dying, left an only Son named <hi>Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is,</hi> who dying without Iſſue after he had reigned Two Years, the Crown was to have deſcended on his Unkle <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> But the States of <hi>France</hi> did exclude him, and choſe <hi>Hugo Capetus,</hi> Earl of <hi>Paris,</hi> for their King; and in an Oration made by their Embaſſadour to <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> did give an Account of their Reaſons for ſo doing, as it is related by <hi>Belforeſt</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Hiſtorian, in theſe very words:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Every Man knoweth</hi> (Lord <hi>Charles</hi>) <hi>that the Suceſſion of the Crown and Kingdom of</hi> France, <hi>according to the ordinary Rights and Laws of the ſame, belongeth unto you, and not unto</hi> Hugh Capet <hi>now our King: But yet the ſame Laws which do give unto you ſuch Right of Succeſſion, do judge you alſo unworthy of the ſame, for that you have not endeavoured hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to frame your Life according to the Preſcript of thoſe Laws, nor according to the Uſe and Cuſtom of the Kingdom of</hi> France, <hi>but rather have allied your ſelf with the</hi> Germans <hi>our old Enemies, and have accuſtomed your ſelf to their vile and baſe Manners. Wherefore ſince you have abandoned and forſaken the ancient Virtue, Amity, and Sweetneſs of your Countrey, your Countrey has alſo abandoned and forſaken you; for we have choſen</hi> Hugh Capet <hi>for our King, and have put you by, and this without any Scruple in our Conſciences at all; eſteeming it for
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48501:44"/>better and more juſt to live under</hi> Hugh Capet, <hi>the poſſeſſor of the Crown, with enjoying the ancient uſe of our Laws, Cuſtoms, Privileges, and Liberties, than under you the next Heir by Blood, in Oppreſſions, ſtrange Cuſtoms, and Cruelty: For, as they who are to make a Voyage in a Ship on a dangerous Sea, do not ſo much reſpect whether the Pilot claims Title to the Ship or no, but rather, whether he be skilful, valiant, and like to bring them in ſafety to their ways end; even ſo our principal care is, to have a good Prince, to lead and guide us happily in this way of Civil and Politick Life; which is the end for which Princes are appointed.</hi> And with this Meſſage ended his Succeſſion and Life, he dying not long after in Priſon.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhall come home, and give you an Inſtance or two in <hi>England,</hi> ſince the Conqueſt, and ſo conclude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Rufus,</hi> ſecond Son of <hi>William the Conqueror,</hi> by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Lanfrank,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who had a great opinion of his Virtue and Probity, was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted King by the conſent of the Realm, his elder Brother <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> being then in the War at <hi>Jeruſalem: William</hi> dying, his younger Brother <hi>Henry,</hi> by his ingenuity and fair carriage, and by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who had greateſt intereſt in the Nobility, and <hi>Maurice</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> a leading-man amongſt the Clergy, obtained alſo the Crown: And <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> was a ſecond time excluded. And though this King <hi>Henry</hi> could pretend no other Title to the Crown than the Election and Admiſſion of the Realm, yet he defended it ſo well, and God proſper'd him with ſucceſs, that when his elder Brother <hi>Robert</hi> came to claim the Kingdom, by force of Arms, he beat him in a pitch'd-Battel, took him Priſoner, and ſo he died miſerable in Bonds.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> had one only Daughter, named <hi>Maud,</hi> or <hi>Matilda,</hi> who was married to the Emperor, and he dying without Iſſue, ſhe was afterwards married to <hi>Geofry Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genet</hi> Earl of <hi>Anjou</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> by whom ſhe had a Son named <hi>Henry,</hi> whom his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father declared Heir-apparent to the Crown in his Life-time; yet after his Death, <hi>Henry</hi> was excluded, and <hi>Stephen</hi> Earl of <hi>Bulloine,</hi> Son of <hi>Adela,</hi> Daughter of <hi>William the Conqueror,</hi> was by the States thought more fit to Govern than Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> who was then but a Child. And this was done by the perſwaſion of <hi>Henry</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and at the ſolicitation of the Abbot of <hi>Glaſtenbury,</hi> and others, who thought they might do the ſame lawfully, and with a good Conſcience, for the publick Good of the Realm.</p>
            <p>But the Event did not prove ſo well as they intended; for this occaſioned great Factions and Diviſions in the Kingdom; for the quieting of which, there was a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament held at <hi>Wallingford,</hi> which paſſed a Law, That <hi>Stephen</hi> ſhould be King only during his Life, and that Prince <hi>Henry</hi> and his Off-ſpring ſhould ſucceed him; and by the ſame Law debarred <hi>William</hi> Son of King <hi>Stephen</hi> from inheriting the Crown, and only made him Earl of <hi>Norfolk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus did the Parliament diſpoſe of the Crown in thoſe days, which was in the year 1153, which ſufficiently proves what I have aſſerted.</p>
            <p>The ſum of all I have ſaid amounts to this: That Government in general is by the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> and conſequently the Ordinance of God; but that the different forms of Government, whether to reſide in One, Few, or Many; or whether it ſhall be continued by Succeſſion or by Election, together with the different meaſures and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations of Power and Authority in Governours of the ſame kind in ſeveral Countries; all theſe things, I ſay, are ordained by, and purely depend upon poſitive and humane Laws: From whence it will neceſſarily follow, That the ſame human Authority (reſiding in King, Lords and Commons, here in <hi>England</hi>) which gave Being to thoſe Laws for the good of the Community, is Superintendent over them, and both may and ought to make any Addition to, or Alteration of them, when the publick Good and Welfare of the Nation ſhall require it; unleſs you will admit, That an Human Authority eſtabliſhing any thing intentionally, for the common good of the Society, which in tract of time, by reaſon of unforeſeen circumſtances and emergencies, proves deſtructive of it, has by that Act concluded it ſelf, and made that accidental Evil moral and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, which to affirm is ſenſleſs and repugnant.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, I hope by this time (ſaid the old Gentleman) you begin to think that the Bill for diſabling the Duke, was not ſo unjuſt and unreaſonable as was pretended; and that the courſe of Succeſſion (being founded upon the ſame bottom with other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Conſtitutions) might likewiſe as juſtly have been altered by the King, Lords, and Commons, as any other Law or Cuſtom whatever.</p>
            <p>And here I might conclude; but becauſe a late <hi>Penſionary Pen</hi> has publickly arraign'd the Wiſdom, Loyalty, and Juſtice of the Honourable Houſe of Commons, on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Bill, I will <hi>ex abundanti</hi> add a word or two more to that particular.</p>
            <pb n="80" facs="tcp:48501:45"/>
            <p>Whereupon he pluck'd a Paper out of his Pocket, entituled, <hi>Great and weighty Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations relating to the Duke and Succeſſor of the Crown, &amp;c.</hi> Which as ſoon as he had read unto us, You ſee here (ſaid he) the true Temper of thoſe men, of whom I firſt gave you caution: There never was an Endeavour (though in a Legal and Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary way) after any Reformation either in Church or State, but the Promoters of it were ſure to be branded by them with the odious imputations of <hi>Fanaticiſm</hi> and <hi>Faction.</hi> Nay, if the Country-Electors of Parliament-men, will not pitch upon ſuch Rake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hells of the Nation as are uſually propoſed by them, but, on the contrary, make uſe of their Freedom and Conſciences in chuſing able, upright, and deſerving perſons; and if good men thus choſen, do but (according to their Duty in the Houſe) enquire into publick Grievances, purſue in a legal courſe notorious Offenders, and conſult and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe the Security of the Government and Proteſtant Religion, the high Church-man immediately ſwells, and in a paſſion tells you, That all this proceeds from the old <hi>Phanatick Leven,</hi> not yet worn out amongſt the People; That we are going back again to Forty One, and acting over afreſh the Sins of our Forefathers.</p>
            <p>Thus ignorantly do they complement the Times and Perſons they endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, by appropriating to them ſuch Virtues as were common to good men in all Ages. But enough of this.</p>
            <p>In the next place, pray obſerve how hypocritically the <hi>Conſiderer</hi> puts this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether Proteſtant Religion was not ſettled in this Nation by the ſame mighty hand of God, that eſtabliſh'd</hi> Jeroboam <hi>in the Kingdom of</hi> Iſrael? [And then adds] <hi>Whether we (like that wicked King) ſhould ſo far deſpair of God's Providence in preſerving the work of his own Hands, as never to think it ſafe, unleſs it be eſtabliſh'd on the Quick-ſands of our own wicked Inventions?</hi> [<hi>viz.</hi> the Bill againſt the Duke.]</p>
            <p>And throughout his whole Diſcourſe, he frequently calls all Care of preſerving our Religion, a Miſtruſt of God's Providence; and on that ſcore calls out to the Nation, O <hi>ye of little Faith, &amp;c.</hi> Now I will allow him, That the leaſt Evil is not to be done, that the greateſt and moſt important Good may enſue: But that the Bill for diſabling the Duke is highly juſtifiable both by the Laws of God and Conſtitution of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, I think, by my former Diſcourſe, I have left no room to doubt: And the <hi>Conſiderer</hi> having ſcarce attempted to prove the contrary, it's prepoſterouſly done of him to give us his Uſe of Reproof, before he has clear'd his Doctrine.</p>
            <p>However, I owe him many thanks for putting me in mind how Proteſtant Religion was firſt eſtabliſh'd here in <hi>England;</hi> it was indeed by the mighty Hand of God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluencing the publick Councils of the Nation, ſo that all imaginable care was taken, both by Prince and People, to reſcue themſelves from under the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Yoke; and accordingly moſt excellent Laws were made againſt the uſurpation and tyranny of that Man of Sin. Our noble Anceſtors, in thoſe days, did not palliate a want of Zeal for their Religion, with a lazy pretence of truſting in God's Providence; but, together with their Prayers to, and Affiance in Heaven, they joyned the Acts of their own Duty, without which (they very well knew) they had no reaſon to expect a Bleſſing from it.</p>
            <p>But now be pleaſed to take notice of the Candor of this worthy <hi>Conſiderer;</hi> nothing leſs will ſerve his turn, than the proving all the Voters for the Bill guilty of the higheſt Perjury; <hi>For</hi> (ſays he) <hi>they have all ſworn in the Oath of Allegiance to bear Faith and true Allegiance to His Majeſty, his Heirs and Succeſſors; but the Duke is Heir,</hi> ergo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A very hopeful Argument indeed! But what if it ſhould happen, (as it is neither impoſſible nor very improbable to imagin it) that the next Heir to the Crown ſhould commit Treaſon, and conſpire the Death of the preſent Poſſeſſor, and for this Treaſon ſhould not only be attainded by Parliament, but executed too: Pray, Mr. <hi>Conſiderer,</hi> would the Parliament in this caſe be guilty of Murder and Perjury? I am confident you will not ſay it. If therefore the next Heir become obnoxious to the Government in a lower degree, why may not the ſame Authority proportion the Puniſhment, and leave him his Life, but debar him of the Succeſſion? This I ſay only to ſhew the abſurdity of his Argument.</p>
            <p>My Anſwer is this: No man can bear Allegiance to two perſons at the ſame time; nor can Allegiance be ever due to a Subject, and therefore my Obligation by the word [<hi>Heir</hi>] in the Oath, does not commence till ſuch Heir has a preſent Right to, or actual Poſſeſſion of the Crown, which if he never attains, either by reaſon of Death, or any other Act that incapacitates and bars him, then can my Obligation to him by the word <hi>Heir</hi> in the Oath never have a beginning.</p>
            <pb n="81" facs="tcp:48501:45"/>
            <p>But beſides all this, it cannot be denied but Mr. <hi>Conſiderer</hi>'s Doctrine does bring great Inconveniences on Succeſſion; for the next Heir (by his way of arguing) is let looſe from all the Reſtrictions and Penalties of Humane Laws; and has no other tyes upon him, not to ſnatch the Crown out of the Hands of the Poſſeſſor, than purely thoſe of his own Conſcience, which is worthy Mr. <hi>Conſiderer</hi>'s higheſt Conſideration.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only take notice of one Objection more, and then conclude, (fearing I have too much treſpaſs'd on your Patience already.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It's very hard</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that a man ſhould loſe his Inheritance becauſe he is of this or that Perſwaſion in Matters of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And truly, Gentlemen, were the Caſe only ſo, I ſhould be intirely of his mind: But alaſs! Popery (whatever Mr. <hi>Conſiderer</hi> is pleas'd to inſinuate) in not an harmleſs innocent Perſwaſion of a Number of Men, differing from others in matters relating to Chriſtian Religion; but is really and truly a different Religion from Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity it ſelf. Nor is the Inheritance he there mentions, an Inheritance only of <hi>Black-Acre</hi> and <hi>White Acre</hi> without any Office annexed, which requires him to be <hi>par Officio:</hi> But the Government and Protection of ſeveral Nations, the Making War and Peace for them, the Preſervation of their Religion, the Diſpoſal of Publick Places and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, the Execution of all Laws, together with many other things of the greateſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, are in this Caſe claimed by the Word <hi>Inheritance;</hi> which if you conſider, and at the ſame time reflect upon the Enſlaving and Bloody Tenents of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> more particularly the Helliſh and Damnable Conſpiracy thoſe of that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion are now carrying on againſt our Lives, our Religion, and our Government; I am confident you will think it as proper for a Wolf to be a Shepherd, as it is for a Papiſt to be the <hi>Defender of our Faith,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Old Gentleman had no ſooner ended his Diſcourſe, but I returned him my hearty Thanks, for the Trouble he had been pleaſed to give himſelf on this Occaſion; and I could not but acknowledge he had given me great Satisfaction in that Affair; what it will give thee, <hi>Charles,</hi> I know not, I am ſure I parted from him very Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy for having been a Fool ſo long. <hi>Adieu,</hi>

               <p>MAny have been the Deſigns of the Papiſts to ſubvert this poor Nation from the Proteſtant Religion to that of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that by all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining Policies poſſibly could be invented, during the Receſs of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament even to the caſting the Odium of their moſt Damnable Deſigns on the Innocency of his Majeſties moſt Loyal Subjects.

               <p>IN the Front of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Nulli negabimus, nulli differimus Juſtitiam,</hi> we will defer or deny Juſtice to no Man; to this the King is Sworn, and with this the Judges are intruſted by their Oaths. I admire what they can ſay for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if they have not read this Law, they are not fit to ſit upon the Bench; and if they have, I had almoſt ſaid, they deſerve to loſe their Heads.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Speaker.</hi> The State of the poor Nation is to be deplored, that in almoſt all ages, the Judges, who ought to be Preſervers of the Laws, have endeavoured to deſtroy them; and that to pleaſe a Court-Faction: they have by Treachery attempted to break the Bonds aſunder of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the great Treaſury of our Peace; it was no ſooner paſſed, but a Chief Juſtice in that day perſwades the King he was not bound by it, becauſe he was under Age when it was paſſed. But this ſort of Inſolence the next Parliament reſented, to the ruine of the pernicious Chief Juſtice. In the time of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, an unthinking diſſolute Prince, there were Judges that did inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate into the King, that the Parliament were only his Creatures, and depended on his Will, and not on the Fundamental Conſtitutions of the Land; which Treacherous Advice proved the Ruine of the King, and for which all thoſe evil Inſtruments were brought to Juſtice. In his late Majeſties Time, his Misfortunes were occaſioned chieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Corruptions of the Long Robe; his Judges by an Extrajudicial Opinion give the King Power to raiſe Money upon an extraordinary Occaſion without Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and made the King Judge of ſuch Occaſions. Charity prompts me to think they thought this a Service to the King, but the ſad Conſequences of it may convince all Mankind, that every illegal Act weakens the Royal Intereſt; and to endeavour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce Abſolute Dominion in theſe Realms, is the worſt of Treaſons, becauſe, whilſt it bears the Face of Friendſhip to the King, and Deſigns to be for his Service, it never fails of the contrary effect.</p>
               <p>The two great Pillars of the Government are Parliaments and Juries; it is this gives us the Title of Free-born Engliſh-men: for my Notion of Free-Engliſh-men is this, that they are ruled by Laws of their own making, and tried by Men of the ſame Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with themſelves. The Two great and undoubted Priviledges of the People have been lately invaded by the Judges that now ſit in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall;</hi> they have Eſpouſed Proclamation againſt Law; they have diſcountenanced and oppoſed ſeveral legal Acts, that tended to the ſitting of this Honourable Houſe; they have graſped the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power into their own Hands, as in that Inſtance of Printing; the Parliament was conſidering that matter, but they in the interim made their private Opinion to be Law, to ſuperſede the Judgment of this Houſe; They have diſcharged Grand Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on purpoſe to quel their Preſentments, and ſhelter great Criminals from Juſtice; and when Juries have preſented their Opinion for the ſitting of this Parliament, they have in diſdain thrown them at their Feet, and told them, they would be no Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets to carry ſuch Petitions; and yet in a few days after, have encouraged all that would ſpit their Venom againſt the Government; they have ſerved an Ignorant and Arbitrary Faction, and been the Meſſengers of Abhorrences to the King.</p>

                  <hi>Mr. Speaker.</hi> What we have now to do, is to load them with ſhame, who have bid defiance to the Law; they are guilty of Crimes againſt Nature, againſt the King, againſt their Knowledge, and againſt Poſterity. The whole frame of Nature doth loudly and daily petition to God their Creator; and Kings, like God, may be addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to in like manner by Petition, not Command. They likewiſe knew it was lawful to petition; Ignorance can be no Plea, and their Knowledge aggravates their Crimes. The Children unborn are bound to curſe ſuch Proceedings, for 'twas not petitioning, but Parliaments they abhorr'd. The Atheiſt pleads againſt a God, not that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believes a Deity, but would have it ſo. <hi>Treſilian</hi> and <hi>Belknap</hi> were Judges too, their Learning gave them Honour, but their Villanies made their <hi>Exit</hi> by a Rope. The end of my Motion therefore is, That we may addreſs warmly to our Prince againſt them, let us ſettle a Committee to enquire into their Crimes, and not fail of doing Juſtice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them that have perverted it; let us purge the Fountain, and the Streams will iſſue pure.</p>

               <head>November <hi>the</hi> 17th. <hi>being appointed for conſideration of His Majeſty's Meſſage, the Order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing read, it was moved by a worthy Member,</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THAT as long as <hi>Popery</hi> hangs over us, we could do nothing, and we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent our condition to the King; and then, when we had ſecured our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Property, we ſhould be ready to do any thing that might make the King hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and great.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Second.</hi> I am ſorry that <hi>Tangier</hi> (that is, a Supply) is moved for, at ſo unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a time; I confeſs, <hi>Tangier</hi> is of great moment, but we have now in hands that which is of greater moment than ten <hi>Tangiers</hi> put together. The conſideration of that, before we are ſecure in our Religion at home, is as when an Enemy was landed we ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards go to fortifie the Coaſts of <hi>Kent.</hi> And being told us by His Majeſty, we ſhould ſecure our ſelves againſt Popery, by all ways but meddling with the Succeſſion, and ſhould reſt there, we are prevented of what is our preſervation: And the providing for <hi>Tangier</hi> now, will be the weakening of our Security. When <hi>Tangier</hi> was put into the hands of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> firſt, there was an Article that there ſhould continue a Popiſh Church, and the Religion that belonged to it to continue their Lives, but not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh'd with new. And if it be enquir'd into, I believe it will be found the number of them is not yet decreaſed. It is not long ſince there was a Popiſh Governour there, many Papiſts and Souldiers gone thither lately from <hi>Ireland.</hi> It is not a little Sum that will do what is needful there; and if it ſhould be a conſiderable one that ſhould be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for it, it may be made uſe of to raiſe an Army there; ſo that we run into a great Inconveniency by providing for it; I think we ought to conſider well of it before we do: And yet I am not for ſullenly ſaying, we will raiſe no Money, but for clearly ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Caſe by an Addreſs to the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Third.</hi> I am only to acquaint you, That <hi>Tangier</hi> is not to be maintained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your Support.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Fourth.</hi> All things are to be conſidered comparatively, and if it be made an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the Duke's Bill, that is at the Head of an Army in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that in <hi>Ireland</hi> there are ten Papiſts to one Proteſtant, his great intereſt in the Fleet, and being Admiral, and <hi>Tangier</hi> being a Seminary of Papiſts, then ſure you have a ſpecial Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to take <hi>Tangier</hi> into your Conſideration, and Money may be for that Service. But then this Parliament do not ask Petitions of Grace, but of Right. And will you part with your Money without any Security? You have often done ſo, and what are you the better for it? I long for the time, when we may give Money to make the King great; but if things muſt go on as they do, I am for a plain Bargain, to know what we ſhall have for our Money. For my part, I only deſire our Security; but if we ſhould give Money, I ſuppoſe you will take care what hands we put it in, and there ought to be a Truſt: Let us Addreſs His Majeſty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Fifth.</hi> We are told <hi>Tangier</hi> is of Importance, it is a Nurſery of Papiſts: And we are likewiſe told, The <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſent thither a part of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army, and they take the Oath, that is no Security: Was not the Lord <hi>Bellaſſis</hi> Governour of <hi>Tangier</hi> and <hi>Hull,</hi> and the Penſioners Captain, all at a time, and took the Oaths; thoſe Souldiers, for ought I know, may be brought hither, and the asking for a Supply for it at this time, is very unreaſonable, becauſe Parliaments have been put off two or three years, and whilſt there are people that dare make a difference between the King and this Houſe, we ſhall never be ſafe. Let us repreſent our Condition as boldly as may ſtand with
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48501:47"/>good manners. It is not to be endured, to ſee the Duke preferred before the King, as he was; as if Arguments of his Greatneſs and Power were Arguments ſtrong enough to hinder the Bill: He hath violated the Law, and we needed not to have gone this way to work, if we could have had Juſtice againſt him; but he is too great for that, let us Addreſs His Majeſty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Smith.</hi> If <hi>Tangier</hi> be wholly under the Duke's Care and Protection, and ſuch a Seminary for Papiſts as hath been repreſented, I think no motion to have a Supply for it is unſeaſonable, and am againſt it; order the bringing in the ſtate of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Seventh.</hi> I ſpoke the fence of the City formerly, and do ſo now again, and in the name of the greateſt part of the Commonalty of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and we do declare, That we are ready to give Money, half we have, nay all, and be content to ſet up again, and get new Eſtates, if we can but be ſecured. The burning of <hi>London,</hi> juſtly laid upon the Papiſts, and keeping Watch ſince the Plot, hath coſt the City above 100000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> The City of <hi>London</hi> is the Bulwark of our Religion: And is it not ſaid, the Duke is at the head of 30 or 40000 men? The Lieutenancy and Juſtices, how are they molded for his turn. And if you do nothing now in this Houſe, we muſt all, without any more ado, try to make a Peace with him as well as we can, I'll never do it: And will you, for the ſake of one man, deſtroy three Kingdoms?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An Highth.</hi> He moved, that the Repreſentation might declare, That we ſee no Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, but removing the Duke of <hi>York.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Ninth.</hi> We diſcourſing of <hi>Tangier</hi> at this time, is like <hi>Nero</hi>'s Fiddling whilſt <hi>Rome</hi> was conſuming by Fire: If it be in a good condition, we cannot help it; if in a bad one, we are not in a poſture to do it. Pray conſider the condition by what's paſt, when King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth was for Supremacy, the Kingdom was for it; when King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth was againſt it, the Kingdom was againſt it. When King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth was a Proteſtant, the Kingdom was ſo; when Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was a Papiſt, the Kingdom was ſo; when Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was a Proteſtant, the Kingdom ſo again; <hi>Regis ad exemplum,</hi> &amp;c. And I believe, even in King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's time, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops themſelves would not have been for throwing out ſuch a Bill as this. And if King <hi>Edward</hi> had promiſed any thing for the preſervation of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> ſo that <hi>Mary</hi> might ſucceed, the Pope would no way have contrived ſo great a Favour. The bidding us prevent <hi>Popery,</hi> and the letting alone a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Succeſſor, is as if a Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſhould come to a man in a <hi>Pleuriſie,</hi> and tell him, he may make uſe of any Remedies but letting of Blood; the Party muſt periſh, that being the only Cure. I am not at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for giving of Money, that being to the State as Food to the Stomach; if that be clean, meat turns to good Nouriſhment; but if it be out of order, it breeds Diſeaſes: And ſo it is in the State, if that be not in order too. We have been often deceived, and by the ſame men again. Was not 200000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> given for the Fleet in 74, and was any of it employed that way? Money given for an actual War with <hi>France,</hi> employed for a diſhonourable Peace. Never ſo many Admirals, and ſo few Ships to guard us; never more Commiſſioners of the Treaſury, and ſo little Money; never ſo many Counſellors, and ſo little Safety: Let us addreſs His Majeſty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Tenth.</hi> I'll never be for giving of Money for promoting Popery, and a Succeſſor a publick Enemy to the Kingdom, and a Slave to the Pope: Whilſt he hath 11 to 7 in the Council, and 63 to 31 in the Houſe of Lords, we are not ſecure. And if my own Father had been one of the 63, I ſhould have voted him an Enemy to the King and Kingdoms; and if we cannot live <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> I hope we ſhall dye ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Eleventh.</hi> Redreſs our Grievances firſt, and then, and not till then, Money. <hi>Tangier</hi> never was, nor will be a place of Trade. <hi>Tituan</hi> and <hi>Sally</hi> ſo near, they will never trade with us to deſtroy themſelves, and can never be for our Advantage. And I have many years wonder'd at the Council that have been for the keeping of it; and am of opinion, that <hi>Popery</hi> may be aimed at by it, and that our Councils are managed at <hi>Rome,</hi> from whence I ſaw a Letter from a Friend, dated the 21th. of <hi>October,</hi> with the Heads of the King's Speech in it, to this effect, That His Majeſty would command them not to meddle with the Succeſſion; That he would ask no Money; That he would ſtand upon the Confirmation of the Lord <hi>Danby</hi>'s Pardon; and, That the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Tangier</hi> was to draw on Expences, and was it not, would be for the blowing of it up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Twelfth.</hi> I am for a Repreſentation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirteenth.</hi> I remember, before the laſt Seſſion of Parliament, there was a Council held at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and there hatched a Bill againſt Popery. It was for the breeding of Children of a Popiſh Succeſſor, which admitted the thing; and it was called a Bill againſt Popery, but we called it the Popiſh Bill. I am for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48501:47"/>not for the Church-men of the late Biſhop of St. <hi>Aſaph,</hi> on his Death-bed, good man, could hardly forbear declaring himſelf, which his Epitaph did <hi>(Ora pro Anima)</hi> orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be written upon his Tomb. We are told the other day, we ought to make the Duke a Subſtantive to ſtand by himſelf; That there was leſs danger of a General with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Army, than an Army without a General. And I have read in <hi>Pliny</hi> which was moſt to be feared, an Army of Lyons with an Hare to their General, or an Army of Hares with a Lyon to their General? and it was concluded, that an Army of Hares with a Lyon to their General, was moſt to be feared of the two. His Majeſty is inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a ſort of Monſters, who endeavour to deſtroy, and I hope to move againſt them before we riſe; and though we have loſt our laſt Bill, we have not loſt our Courage and Hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourteenth.</hi> His Majeſty deſires your Advice and Aſſiſtance, it is ſeldom, which is very kind, and though you ſhall think fit not to give the latter, it's but mannerly to give the firſt. And I hope you will not reſent any Injury, if any there were done by the Houſe of Lords on the King, who though he cannot cure all ill in one day, he can ruine all. And I acquaint you, there is a very great Weight laid upon this Seſſion of Parliament, and upon the agreeing of the King with the People, on which depends the Welfare of the Proteſtants abroad, and hope you will not go about to Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifteenth.</hi> If you had ſent the Duke's, Lord <hi>Craven</hi>'s, and <hi>Mulgrave</hi>'s Regiment to <hi>Tangier,</hi> it would ſupply the Place with Men, and Disband the Lord <hi>Oxford</hi>'s Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Money on thoſe imployed, would bear much of the ſhare of this.</p>
               <q>Then the Houſe Reſolved to appoint a Committee to draw up an Addreſs upon the Debate of this Houſe, to repreſent His Majeſty the State and Condition of the Kingdom, in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to His Majeſties Meſſage about <hi>Tangier.</hi>

               <p>THE Gentleman that ſpoke laſt, ſeems to intimate that we ought to have a due regard to the Kings Brother, and conſider what infinite diſadvantages will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crew to us, if we are too haſty in our Reſolutions, as before the Duke is found guilty, to proceed to paſs a Bill for Excluſion; for that nothing but War and Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed can be expected from it; therefore he ſays we ought to be moderate, and find out a Medium to ſecure the Proteſtant Religion, notwithſtanding the Duke may be a Papiſt. Now Gentlemen, I give you the Dictates of my Heart, without either Paſſion or Prejudice, and ſhould be as willing as any Perſon to agree with what that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath propoſed, if any ſuch Reaſon can be brought to enforce it. For my part, I think it abſolutely impoſſible that this Kingdom can be ſafe, or the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſucceed under a Popiſh Succeſſor; for do but Review the Ancient and Modern Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, and you ſhall find how Proteſtants have lived under a Popiſh King; have they not been Maſſacred, Butchered and Enſlaved in <hi>Germany, France,</hi> and in our own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, notwithſtanding all the Laws, Vows and Promiſes to the contrary? Are not the Tenets of the Papiſts deſtructive to the Proteſtant Religion, which is Hereſie, and that Faith is not to be kept with ſuch? See the barbarous Uſage of the Proteſtants in <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> and in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Time; How then can we expect any better ſucceſs? for by how much a Popiſh Prince ſeems to be Religious, by ſo much ought he to be looked upon deſperately dangerous; for ſince the Papiſts make ſuch Plotting and Deſigning to ſubvert our Religion under a Proteſtant Prince, how much more will they act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us under a Popiſh Succeſſor? For to think to Reſtrain a Prince under the Power of a penal Law, thereby to ſecure Religion, is no more than to tye <hi>Sampſon</hi> with Cords; for will not the Courteors be flattered by their Prince, to imitate the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion with him? and then will not we Proteſtants be diſcountenanced, and none but Prieſts and Jeſuites have Dominion over us? For my part, if you paſs not this Bill, we ſhall all agree to have our Throats cut; and I have no patience at all for that: you ſee how the Duke of <hi>York</hi> being a Papiſt, they have all the dependency on him, and hope
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48501:48"/>to perfect their Villanies. Therefore take away this General, and this Army may be ſecured; and then being united at home, we need not fear what all the Papiſts in the World can do unto us, when we fight for the maintenance of our Laws and Religion by Excluſion of a Popiſh Prince, and rather withſtand any Violence that ſhall be brought againſt us, than be in Danger every day to have our Throats cut by thoſe that are amongſt us. One Gentleman was pleaſed to ſay, that it was a Papiſt Jeſuits Bill, and that which they brand the Papiſts withall, <hi>(viz)</hi> Depoſing of Princes. I do ſay as to that, That we do not Depoſe <hi>James</hi> D. of <hi>Y.</hi> but as being a Papiſt, conſidering the ſad Conſequence that will enſue; for ſhould we admit a Papiſt, we ſhould give away the Crown, for he would only have the Title, the Pope would be our Sovereign. And we ought to prevent any ſuch Uſurpers, who no doubt would make havock of our Eſtates, if he ſpares us our Lives. To tell us that Excluſion will cauſe a Civil War, I am of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Opinion; for it will be more conducing to the Preſervation of the Kings Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Government, our Laws, Lives and Religion, to be Unanimous. Whereas Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, Fire and Faggot, might cauſe People to Rebel and be Mutunous, when the other would be a means to unite us. As I will give you a reaſon why we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain him otherwiſe, or uſe moderation towards him; for ſuppoſe I were riding a full ſpeed on the Road on a ſecure Horſe, a Gentleman paſſing by, deſired me to be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, for that I would kill my Horſe, when at the ſame time he knows that if I ſlacken my pace, I ſhall have my throat cut by thieves that are ſwiftly purſuing me; therefore I cannot be moderate in this caſe, unleſs I will fling away my Life. And I will lay down another Similitude, that is, if I were Sayling to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and paſſing the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial Line, moſt of the Sea-men were diſtempered through Heat, and on their ſick Beds, but it being told them, that the Ship is in danger of ſinking, for there ſprings a Leak, upon which they all ariſe, and inſtantly fall to Pump; but the Chyrurgeon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints them, that if they do not work more moderately, they will get the Calenture, and ſo deſtroy themſelves; but they give him only the Hearing, knowing that if they ceaſe never ſo little, they are all drowned in the Deep: therefore in this caſe there can be no Moderation. And to give an Inſtance in Holy Writ, <hi>Moſes</hi> was a meek and mild Man, and a moderate Man, but ſeeing an <hi>Egyptian</hi> and an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> fighting, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſlew the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> for he knew it was to no purpoſe to be moderate with him; and afterwards ſeeing two Iſraelites fighting, endeavoured to part them, telling them, they were Brethren, and ought to be moderate; ſo we muſt place it upon the right Object, and not ſuffer our ſelves and Poſterity to be irrecoverably undone.</p>

I am ſure it is ſo to the Royal Family, they cannot be ſafe till the Bill be paſſed; in tenderneſs to one Branch we muſt endanger the whole.</p>
               <p>That worthy Gentleman that moved laſt, ſeems to intimate, that the paſſing this Bill is againſt our Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy: I admire his Miſtake, and it is the firſt time I ever heard the Proteſtant Oaths cited to juſtifie a Popiſh Succeſſor: it is ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged we are ſworn to the King, his Heirs and lawful Succeſſors; it is true, we are ſo, but not obliged to any in the Kings life time but himſelf, for that were Treaſon: He has no Heirs or Succeſſors by Law during his own Life, <hi>Non eſt Heres viventis.</hi> We are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe told, we are deſigning a Bill to UNITE the Proteſtant Intereſt, but will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it, becauſe many true Proteſtants are for the true Heir, and for the D. of <hi>Y.</hi> if he be ſo, which may occaſion the Effuſion of much Blood amongſt us.</p>

               <p>UNITY is deſired by all, yet let us be glad to divide from ſuch Men, for when this Bill is paſſed, their falſe Loyalty will be a Crime, and we know not what Character to give it, and what Puniſhment to aſſign them; LOYALTY is a Correſpondency and Submiſſion to the Law, it is that ſurrounds the King, and makes his Perſon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred.</p>
               <p>It is hinted that we muſt Impeach the Duke, I ſhould be for that if he did not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48501:48"/>I will not ſay fly from Juſtice; if we Impeach him being abſent, we can only Attaint him, and ſhould he ſurvive the King, and be then Lawful Heir, the Deſcent of the Crown takes off all Attainders, and ſuch Proceedings were only an Illuſion, and would indeed involve us in Blood.</p>
               <p>Let us diſable him, 'tis abſolutely neceſſary, without 'tis impoſſible to ſalve. I perceive no Gentleman here has confidence to deny the Loyalty of the Fact, or excuſe the black Crimes that appear before us. Why do they not anſwer the Evidence that is now come in? If it be falſe, contradict it; if true, what is the Reaſon of this Debate? Is not the King alive? Is not all Loyalty due to him? Love hates a Competitor, much more a Crown.</p>

            <p>You have Witneſſes againſt a Great Perſon, one before, another now; he is a Lord, a Privy Counſellor, and ſits in Council ſtill: My Lord of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> he is in the <hi>Gate-Houſe,</hi> but not ſecured: There is one <hi>Informant</hi> tells you they received Incouragement from the D. of <hi>Y.</hi> and that he promiſed them Aſſiſtance: I call not the Truth of this in queſtion, but we ſee they make uſe of theſe great Names: ſo that even in this Kings time, we are not ſecure a day without the Bill. They have Reaſon to believe that a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Succeſſor will aſſiſt them in their Rebellion.</p>
            <p>Now we ſee why our Miniſters made a Peace; We thought our Security to be in the <hi>French</hi> Kings being involved in a War: Now I ſay, the reaſon of the <hi>Nimeguen Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiaries</hi> making a Peace is ſeen, to have the <hi>French</hi> King be at Liberty to ſend Men into <hi>Ireland.</hi> Here you have a full Confirmation of this Evidence; We ſee our danger both at home and abroad, and what poſture we are in, if any means be left for our Security.</p>
            <p>Let theſe <hi>Depoſitions</hi> be Printed that the Country may ſee our Danger: if we will not Impeach the Earl of <hi>Tyrone</hi> preſently; if he ſhould write into <hi>Ireland,</hi> I am afraid he will find too much Favour there: conſider the Caſe of this Lord the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor; he is a great Man, and a Lawyer; if I thought we could not reach him, we would not go about to Impeach him. Agree with the Lords in their Vote, and deſire them to agree with you, that the Papiſts may not draw their Incouragement from a Popiſh Succeſſor.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Mr. Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have not hitherto troubled you, and am ſo ſenſible of my own inabilities in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of ſo many wiſer and abler Men in this Houſe; that 'tis with great unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I riſe up to ſpeak; but when I hear the Honour and Juſtice of this Houſe call'd in queſtion, as it was by that Honourable Member which ſpake laſt; I cannot I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs bear it with patience, but muſt (as I think it my Duty) endeavour to vindicate the Juſtice of the Houſe: for I muſt profeſs Sir, that in my Judgment this Bill is ſo far from an unjuſt thing, that it is rather a Favour to him, ſince if he were proceeded againſt by Impeachment for the Crimes he is accuſed of by ſeveral Witneſſes, he might perhaps forfeit more than a Crown; which for our Safeties only we go about to exclude him from enjoying: And ſince it is undoubtedly in the Power of Parliaments to diſpoſe of ſuch Succeſſions, it ſeems very hard with me to tax this Houſe with Unjuſtice for ſo doing, upon ſo great reaſon and neceſſity as now requires it.</p>
            <p>I will not Sir, at all deny the many great Services (mentioned by that Honourable Member,) the Duke has done the Nation at Sea, nor will I ſay any thing at all in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation of any one of them, but yet I do not think he fought for us when he was aſleep.</p>
            <pb n="88" facs="tcp:48501:49"/>
            <p>There are ſeveral things Sir, wherein this Nation hath been betrayed, I will not ſay any of them directly upon him, but when I think of ſome of them, I am very much ſtartled and know not well what to believe, for when I conſider that in the Fire of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> there were ſeveral outlandiſh Men taken in the very act of Firing a Houſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delivered to the Guard, were preſently ſet at Liberty by the Officer that command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and that ſuch a Man ſhould ever ſince not only continue, but increaſe in the Duke's Favour to the greateſt Degree imaginable, I muſt confeſs I do not like it, and I think it looks very ill.</p>
            <p>When I alſo think of the general Deſign which plainly appears to have been carried on all along, to deſtroy the People, and to weaken the Nation as much as poſſible, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apears by the Treachery was uſed at <hi>Chatham,</hi> and the <hi>French's</hi> ſtanding ſtill while the <hi>Dutch</hi> and we cut one anothers Throats, this alſo in my Judgment is very ill nor doth it appear better that it was taken ill, that the D. of <hi>Monmouth</hi> when he was ſent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> did not cut thoſe poor miſerable Peoples Throats. (But that Prince had too much humanity and diſcretion than to do it.) But I do not particularly charge any Perſon with theſe.</p>
            <p>There are many things Sir, ſpoken of by the witneſſes you have heard relating to the Duke, as alſo ſeveral things in the Letters you have heard read, I ſhall not repeat any of them: I will only tell you a Paſſage comes into my mind, and I do not tell it for the ſake of the Story, but that it appears to me by it, that the Duke was either ſomewhat concerned in the Plot, or at leaſt to hinder the diſcovery of it; for the D. ſpeaking publickly to all that were round him, of one <hi>Le Faire</hi> that was accuſed by Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> to have been one of Sir <hi>E. B. Godfreys</hi> Murderers, and one of the Queens ſervants, he ſaid that could not be, becauſe there was no ſuch Man as <hi>Le Faire</hi> about the Queen, but yet it ſo fell out they ſay, that in ſome little time after there was a Bond found, under this Man's own hand, and he proved to be one of the Queens Servants, and run away upon this Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Now Sir, if this were ſo, 'tis impoſſible the other ſhould be true, and if a Prince, or any Man ſpeaks an untruth, it is a fault ſo hateful to me, that I muſt confeſs I know not what to call it, nor what Name to give it, (It is the Devil.)</p>
            <p>I ſhall trouble you Sir, with one thing more which comes into my mind, and if true, is as bad as any thing can be: There was Sir, a <hi>French</hi> Proteſtant came o're to the King to make Propoſals for the Intereſt of the Proteſtant Religion—</p>

            <p>I wonder that Noble Lord ſhould thus interrupt me, for I have not poſitively affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med any thing at all of the Duke, though I have ſaid nothing but what in my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I thought might be truth, and I ſhall not change my mind for his being diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at it; but however I am very well ſatisfied to ſay no more, but only, that I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that Honourable Perſon by the Bar, told us, he would not ſpeak to the prudential part againſt the Bill, and truly Sir, I think he has kept his Word very exactly: and that, whereas another Member before him objected, <hi>That it was poſſible the Duke might turn Proteſtant,</hi> I would only anſwer, that I do not think it poſſible, that any Perſon that has been bred up in the Proteſtant Religion, and hath been weak enough (for ſo I muſt call it) to turn Papiſt, ſhould ever after (in that reſpect) be wiſe enough to turn Proteſtant, and therefore Sir, upon the whole matter, my humble Motion is, <hi>That the Bill may paſs.</hi>

               <p>HIS Majeſties relies not only on the Dictates of his own Judgment, but is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Judgment of the Houſe of Lords; but many of them have gained their Honour by Intereſt rather than Merit.

I never knew that <hi>Tangier</hi> was more conſiderable than all the Three Kingdoms: Is it time to be ſilent, or not?

               <head>The Fourth Speech by a Perſon of Honour.</head>
               <p>I think the Debate is upon a Meſſage from the King; and the moſt eſpecial part is about the Bill; I concur with that Noble Perſon, rather than with all the reſt; But begin with the firſt, his Majeſty hath ſuffered us twice to addreſs upon the Bill; yet the Lords have not admitted one Conference; I believe every man came unwillingly into this Bill; have any that were againſt it propoſed any thing for our Security, if they will, let them ſtand up, and I will ſit down: I have adviſed with Men that know the Laws, Religion and Government; they ſay, if you will preſerve this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this Law, this Bill muſt paſs: We have received no expedient from the Lords; the State of the Nation lies at their Door: they ſit to hear Cauſes, they mind you of Mr. <hi>Seymour,</hi> but ſay nothing of the Bills. In <hi>Richard</hi> the Second his Time, ſome Lords were ſaid to be Lords in the King's Pocket, but had no ſhoulders to ſupport him. It's plain our evil comes from evil Miniſters. There are ſome that will have a Prince of one Religion on the Throne, to rule the People of another; a Popiſh Prince and a Proteſtant Kingdom, will any Miniſters of parts, unleſs they have an indifferency of Religion, think this conſiſtent? I dedicate my Allegiance to the King, they to another Perſon, ſo the Kingdom muſt be deſtroy'd, either this limited Monarchy muſt ſtand, or come to Blood; on the other ſide <hi>Water-Monarchy</hi> is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ſupported by little men of no Fortune, and he that takes mean and low men to make Miniſters of, ſets up for <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Government: The King hath Counſels born; if you have a Popiſh Prince, and a Proteſtant Parliament, will the King ever concur with them in matters of Religion and Property, are not your Eſtates ſprinkled with <hi>Abbey-Lands?</hi> If he asks Money, will you truſt him? muſt Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers comply with a Prince that in effect hath no People?

               <p>Now I ſee the Houſe is full, ſo conſiderate, I am bound to give my Thoughts.

When <hi>Clifford</hi> ſet up bare-fac'd for <hi>Popery,</hi> he brought the King to come fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to the Houſe of Lords. <hi>Cranmer</hi> ſaith, That King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, paſſed the Act of 6 <hi>Articles</hi> in an Un-Parliamentary way, <hi>by the Kings coming and ſolliciting.

The King calls it <hi>an Opinion,</hi> and tells you <hi>he is confirmed in it by the Houſe of Lords;</hi> he may come to take up other Reſolutions, if the Parliament go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and leave this work undone: The King is in the higheſt Danger, though ſome men think they ſhall be accounted Loyal for oppoſing an <hi>Act of Parliament;</hi> it is but a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48501:50"/>Nick-name. King <hi>James</hi> in his Speech, 1603, thought it his Security to comply with his Parliament: Nay, <hi>He would betray his Country and Poſterity in not doing it.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what care the laſt King took <hi>to have his Poſterity maintain the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Remember Queen <hi>Mary</hi> broke her Word for <hi>Conſcience ſake every day;</hi> a Security would draw me from the Bill. Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Aſſociation againſt the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> in the <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> was an <hi>Excluſion,</hi> ſhe was but a Woman, but had wiſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors; Prelates <hi>then did not fear the frown of a Prince.</hi> Surely when the King ſees ſo many Gentlemen of this Houſe ſo firm, he will take their Adviſe, and Prorogue them, and then paſs the Bill.

            <head>Some particular Matters of Fact relating to the Adminiſtration of Affairs in <hi>Scotland</hi> under the Duke of <hi>LAUDERDALE.</hi>
            </head>
            <head type="sub">Humbly offered to Your Majeſty's Conſideration, in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Your Royal Commands.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THE Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> did groſly miſrepreſent to your Majeſty the Condition of the Weſtern Countries, as if they had been in a ſtate of Rebellion, though there had never been any oppoſition made to your Majeſty's Authority, nor any Reſiſtance offered to your Forces, nor to the execution of the Laws. But he purpoſing to abuſe your Majeſty, that ſo he might carry on his ſiniſtrous Deſigns by your Authority, adviſed your Majeſty to raiſe an Army againſt your peaceable Subjects; at leaſt did frame a Letter, which he ſent to your Majeſty to be ſigned by your Royal Hand to that effect; which being ſent down to your Council, Orders was thereupon given out for raiſing an Army of Eight or Nine thouſand men, the greateſt part whereof were <hi>Highblanders;</hi> and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that, to avert threatning, the Nobility and Gentry of that Country did ſend to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and for the ſecurity of the Peace did offer to engage, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhould be ſent to put the Laws in execution, ſhould meet with no affront; and that they would become Hoſtages for their ſafety: yet this Army was marched and led into a peaceable Country, and did take <hi>free Quarters</hi> according to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, and in moſt places levied great Sums of Money, under notion of dry Quarters, and did plunder and rob your Subjects; of which no redreſs could be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, though Complaints were frequently made: all which were expreſly contrary to the Laws of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In their Quarters it was apparent that regard was only had to the Dukes private Animoſities; for the greateſt part of thoſe places that were moſt quartered on and deſtroyed, had not been guilty of the Field-Conventicles complained of, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the places that were moſt guilty were ſpared upon private Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Subjects at that time were required to ſubſcribe an exorbitant and illegal Bond, which was impoſſible to be performed by them; that they, their Wives and Children and Servants ſhould live orderly according to Law, not go to Conventicles, or entertain vagrant Preachers, with ſeveral other particulars; by which Bond, thoſe that ſigned it were made lyable for every Man's fault that lived upon their Ground.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Your Majeſty's Subjects were charged with Laborrows denounced Rebels; and Captions were iſſued out for ſeizing their perſons upon their refuſing to ſign the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Bond: and the Nobility and Gentry there who have ever been faithful to your Majeſty, and had appeared in Arms for ſuppreſſing the laſt Rebellion, were diſarmed upon Oath. A Proclamation was alſo iſſued, forbidding them upon great Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty to keep any Horſes above four Pounds ten groats price.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Nobility and Gentry of the Shire of <hi>Ayre</hi> were alſo indicted at the inſtance of your Majeſty's Advocate of very high Crimes and Miſdemeanors: whereof ſome did import Treaſon. Theſe Indictments were delivered them in the Evening, to be anſwered by them the next Morning upon Oath: and when they did demand two or three days time to conſider of their Indictments, and crave the benefit of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers to adviſe with in matters of ſo high concernment; and alſo excepted to their being put to ſwear againſt themſelves in matters that were Capital, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all Law and Juſtice; thoſe their deſires were rejected, though the like had never been done to the greateſt Malefactor in the Kingdom. And it was told them, they muſt either ſwear inſtantly, or they would repute them guilty and proceed accordingly.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Noblemen and Gentlemen knowing themſelves innocent of all that had been ſurmiſed againſt them, did purge themſelves by Oath of all the particulars that were objected to them, and were thereupon acquitted. And though the Committee of the Council uſed the ſevereſt manner of enquiry to diſcover any Seditious or Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Deſigns, which were pretended as the grounds of leading in that Army into thoſe Countries; yet nothing could ever be proved: ſo falſe was that Suggeſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Rebellion then deſigned that was offered to your Majeſty, and prevailed with you for ſending the aforementioned Letter.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Oppreſſions and Quarterings ſtill continued. The Noblemen and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of thoſe Countries went to <hi>Edenburgh</hi> to preſent to your Council the heavy
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48501:52"/>Preſſure that they and their people lay under, and were ready to offer to them all that in Law or Reaſon could be required of them for ſecuring the peace. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil did immediately upon their appearing there, ſet forth a Proclamation requiring them to depart the Town within three days upon all higheſt pains: and when the Duke of <hi>Hamilton</hi> did petition for leave to ſtay two three or days longer for ſome very urgent Affairs, that was refuſed him.</p>
            <p n="8">8. When ſome Perſons of Quality had declared to the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> that they would go to repreſent their condition to your Majeſty, if they could not have Juſtice from your Miniſters; for preventing that, a Proclamation was ſet forth, forbidding all the Subjects to depart the Kingdom without Licenſe; that ſo your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty might not be acquainted with the ſaid condition of your Subjects from making their application to your Majeſty, no leſs contrary to your Majeſty's true Intereſt (who muſt always be the Refuge of his People) than to the natural right of the Subject.</p>
            <p>The former Particulars relate to the Invaſion of the Rights of great numbers of your Subjects all at once. What follow, have indeed only fallen on ſome ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; yet are ſuch, that your whole People apprehend they may be all upon the ſlighteſt occaſions brought under the like Miſchiefs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Council hath upon many occaſions proceeded to a new kind of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of declaring men uncapable of all publick Truſt; concerning which your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty may remember what Complaints the ſaid Duke made, when during the Earl of <hi>Middleton</hi>'s Adminiſtration, he himſelf was put under, and incapacitated by an Act of Parliament. The Words of his Paper againſt the Earl of <hi>Middleton</hi> are <hi>[Unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitating]</hi> was to whip with Scorpions, a puniſhment to rob men of their Honour, and to lay a laſting ſtain upon them and their Poſterity. And if this was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, when done by the higheſt Court of Parliament, your Majeſty may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude, it cannot be done in any lower Court. But yet notwithſtanding it is become of late years an ordinary Sentence in Council, when the leaſt Complaints are brought againſt any, with whom the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> and his Brother are offended.</p>
            <p>Inſtances of this are:</p>
            <p>The declaring Thirteen worthy Citizens of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> uncapable of publick Truſt, againſt whom no Complaint was ever made to this day. as your Majeſty will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by a Paper more fully concerning that Affair. The true cauſe of it was, that thoſe men being in the Magiſtracy, that Duke and his Brother could not get a vaſt Bribe from them out of the Towns-money, which was afterwards obtained when they were removed.</p>
            <p>The Provoſt of <hi>Glaſcow, Aberdeen</hi> and <hi>Jadburgh</hi> were put under the ſame Sentence, for ſigning a Letter to your Majeſty in the Convention of the Burroughs with the reſt of that Body, which Letter was adviſed by him who is now your Majeſty's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, as that which had nothing in it which could bring them under any guilt; and yet thoſe three were ſingled out of the whole number, and incapacitated, beſides an high Fine and long Impriſonment, as to your Majeſty will more fully appear by another Paper.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Patrick Holme</hi> of <hi>Polworth</hi> being ſent by the Shire of <hi>Berwick</hi> to complain of ſome illegal Proceedings, and to obtain a legal remedy to them, which he did only in the common Form of Law, was alſo declared uncapable of publick Truſt, beſides many months Impriſonment.</p>
            <p>The Provoſt of <hi>Linlythgo</hi> being complained of for not furniſhing ſome of your For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with Baggage Horſes, was called before the Council, and becauſe he ſaid they were not bound in Law to furniſh Horſes in ſuch manner, he was immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared incapable of publick Truſt, and was both fined and impriſoned.</p>
            <p>There are alſo fifty of the Town of St. <hi>Johnſtons</hi> incapacitated upon a very ſlight pretence, ſo that it's very impoſſible for them to find a ſufficient number of Citizens for the Magiſtracy of that Town.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Your Subjects are ſometimes upon ſlight, and ſometimes upon no grounds im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, and often kept Priſoners many Months and years, nothing being objected to them, and are required to enter themſelves Priſoners; which is contrary to Law. It was in the former Article expreſſed, that many of theſe Perſons declared incapable of publick Truſt, did alſo ſuffer Impriſonment; and beſides theſe inſtances, Lieutenant General <hi>Drummond,</hi> (whoſe eminent Loyalty and great Services are well known to your Majeſty,) was required to enter himſelf Priſoner in the Caſtle of <hi>Dunbarton,</hi> where he was kept one year and a half; and was made a cloſe Priſoner for nine months of that time, and yet nothing was ever objected to him to this day to juſtifie that Uſage.</p>
            <pb n="95" facs="tcp:48501:52"/>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Cardroſs</hi> was for his Ladies keeping two Conventicles in her own Houſe (at which he was not preſent) fined 110 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> and hath now been kept priſoner four years in the Caſtle of <hi>Edenburg,</hi> where he ſtill remains; although he hath often petitioned for his Liberty; and Sir <hi>Patrick Holme</hi> hath been now a ſecond time almoſt one year, and nothing is yet laid to his charge.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe illegal Impriſonments, the Officers of your Majeſties Forces fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently carry Warrants with them for apprehending perſons that are under no legal Cenſure, nor have been ſo much as cited to appear; which hath put many of your Subjects under great fears, eſpecially upon what was done in Council three years ago: Captain <hi>Carſtairs</hi> (a man now well enough known to your Majeſty) did intrap one <hi>Kirkton,</hi> an outed Miniſter, into his Chamber at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and did violently abuſe him; and deſigned to have extorted ſome money from him: The noiſe of this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Ears of one <hi>Baily,</hi> Brother-in-law to the ſaid <hi>Kirkton,</hi> he came to the houſe, and hearing him cry Murder, Murder, forced open the Chamber door, where he found his Brother-in-law and the Captain grapling; the Captain pretended to have a Warrant againſt <hi>Kirkton,</hi> and <hi>Baily</hi> deſired him to ſhew it, and promiſed, that all obedience ſhould be given to it: But the Captain refuſing to do it, <hi>Kirkton</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcued. This was only delivering a man from the hands of a Robber, which Nature obligeth all men to do; eſpecially when joyned with ſo near a Relation. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain complained of this to the Council, and the Lord <hi>Hatton</hi> with others were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to examine the Witneſſes: And when it was brought before the Council, the Duke of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Earls of <hi>Mereton, Dumfrize</hi> and <hi>Kinkarden,</hi> the Lord <hi>Cocheren,</hi> and Sir <hi>Archibald Primroſe,</hi> then Lord Regiſter, deſired, that the Report of the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation might be read; but that not ſerving their ends, was denyed. And thereupon thoſe Lords delivered their Opinion, that fithence <hi>Carſtares</hi> did not ſhew any War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, nor was cloathed with any publick Character, it was no oppoſing of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Authority in <hi>Baily,</hi> ſo to reſcue the ſaid <hi>Kirkton;</hi> yet <hi>Baily</hi> was for this fined in 6000. Marks, and kept long a Priſoner.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Lords were upon that ſo repreſented to your Majeſty, that by the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi>'s procurement, they were turned out of the Council, and all command of the Militia. And it can be made appear, that the Captain had at that time no War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant at all againſt <hi>Kirkton,</hi> but procured it after the Violence committed: And it was ante-dated, on deſign to ſerve a turn at that time. This manner of Proceedings hath ever ſince put your ſubjects under ſad apprehenſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is one particular further offered to your Majeſties conſideration, concerning their way of uſing Priſoners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were 14 men taken at a Field Conventicle, who without being legally Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict of that or any other crimes, were ſecretly and in the night taken out of Priſon upon a Warrant ſigned by the Earl of <hi>Lynlythgo,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Hatton</hi> and <hi>Collington,</hi> and were delivered to Captain <hi>Maytland,</hi> who had been Page to the Duke of <hi>Lauder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> but was then a <hi>French</hi> Officer, and was making his Levies in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and were carryed over to the ſervice of the <hi>French</hi> King in the year 1676.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Council hath upon many occaſions, proceeded to moſt unreaſonable and Arbitrary Fines, either for ſlight offences, or for offences where the Fine is regulated by Law, which they have never conſidered, when the perſons were not acceptable to them: So the Lord <hi>Cardroſs</hi> was Fined in 1111 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> for his Ladies keeping two Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles in his houſe, and Chriſtning a Child by an outed Miniſter without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. The Provoſt formerly mentioned, and <hi>Baily</hi> with many more, were alſo fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without any regard to Law.</p>
            <p>The Council hath at ſeveral times proceeded to the taking of Gentlemens Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-houſes from them, and putting Garriſons in them, which in time of peace is contrary to Law. In the year 75. It was deſigned againſt twelve of your Majeſties Subjects, and was put in Execution in the houſes of the Earl of <hi>Calender,</hi> the Lord <hi>Cardroſſe,</hi> the Lady <hi>Lumſden, &amp;c.</hi> and was again attempted in the year 78. the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes belonging to the Leirds of <hi>Coſnock, Blagan,</hi> and <hi>Rowal,</hi> and were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by Souldiers, and declared Garriſons. Nor did it reſt there, but Orders were ſent from the Council, requiring the Countries about thoſe Houſes, to furniſh them for the Souldiers uſe, and to ſupply them with neceſſaries, much contrary to Law. It was againſt this, that Sir <hi>Patrick Holme</hi> came to deſire a remedy; and common Juſtice being denied him, he uſed a legal Proteſtation in the ordinary Form of Law, and was thereupon kept for many Months a Priſoner, and declared incapable of all publick truſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is another particular, which becauſe it is ſo odious, is unwillingly touched: yet it is neceſſary to inform your Majeſty about it; for thereby it will appear, that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48501:53"/>the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> and his Brother have in a moſt ſolemn manner broken the publick faith that was given in your Majeſties name.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Mitchel</hi> being put in Priſon upon great ſuſpicion of his having attempted to murder the late Arch Biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and there being no Evidence againſt him, Warrant was given by the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> (then your Majeſties Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner) and your Council to promiſe him his life if he would confeſs; Whereupon he did confeſs, and yet ſome years after, that perſon, who indeed deſerved many deaths, if there had been any other Evidence againſt him, was upon that confeſſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of the Crime, and the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> and his Brother being put to it by him, did ſwear, that they never gave or knew of any aſſurance of life given him: And when it was objected, that the promiſe was upon Record in the Council books, the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> did in open Court, where he was preſent only as a Witneſs, and ſo ought to have been ſilent, threaten them, if they ſhould proceed to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of that Act of Council, which, as he then ſaid, might infer perjury on them that ſwore: and ſo did cut off the proof of that defence, which had been admitted by the Court as good in Law, and ſufficient to ſave the Priſoner, if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Thus was that man hanged upon that Confeſſion only, though the promiſe that drew it from him, doth appear upon Record, and can be proved by good and clear Evidence. And from this your Majeſty may judge, what credit may be given to ſuch men.</p>
            <p>We do not at preſent enlarge on other particulars, though of great importance; ſuch as Monopolies, ſelling places of Honors, turning men of known integrity out of their Imployments, to which they had a good and juſt right during their lives: the profits of one of the moſt conſiderable of theſe, being ſequeſtred for ſometime, and applyed for the Dutcheſs of <hi>Lauderdales</hi> uſe: the treating about, and receiving of great bribes by the Duke and Dutcheſs of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Hatton,</hi> and particularly from the Towns of <hi>Edenborough, Abberdeen, Lynlythgo,</hi> and many others, for procuring from your Majeſty Warrants for illegal impoſitions within theſe Towns: the manifeſt and publick perverting of Juſtice in the Seſſion: beſides the moſt ſignal abuſes of the Mint and Copper Coin, that are moſt grievous to all your Subjects. But the number of theſe is ſo great, and they will require ſo many Witneſſes, to be brought hither for proving them, that we fear it would too much trouble your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty now to examine them all: but your Majeſty ſhall have a full account of them afterwards.</p>
            <p>One thing is humbly offered to your Majeſty, as the root of theſe and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther oppreſſions, which is, that the Method of governing that Kingdom for ſeveral years hath been, That the Lord <hi>Hatton</hi> and his adherents frame any Letter that they deſire from your Majeſty to your Council, and ſend it to the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> who returns it ſigned; and this is brought to the Council: upon which if at any time a debate ariſeth concerning the matter of that Letter, as being againſt or with Law; and when it is propoſed, that a repreſentation of that ſhould be made to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; then the Lord <hi>Hatton</hi> in his inſolent way, calls to have it put to the queſtion, as if it were a crime to have any Warrant either debated or repreſented to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, which is procured by the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> or himſelf; and this is ecchoed by his Party, and by this means any further debating is ſtopped.</p>
            <p>There are ſome other particulars relating to theſe heads, that are to be offered to your Majeſty in other Papers, which are not added here, leſt your Majeſty ſhould now be troubled with too long a Paper.</p>

               <hi>The Impeahment of the Duke and Dutcheſs of</hi> Lauderdale, <hi>with their Brother My Lord</hi> Hatton, <hi>Preſented to His Majeſty by the City of</hi> Edenbourgh. <hi>The matters of Fact particularly relating to the Town of</hi> Edenbourgh, <hi>humbly offered for your Majeſties Information. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Matter of Fact be ſpoken to, it is neceſſary that your Majeſty be informed of one thing upon which this whole Affair hath moved.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe City of <hi>Edenbourgh</hi> had at ſeveral times given conſiderable ſums of Money to the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> amounting to upward of Twelve Thouſand pounds <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Hatton,</hi> Brother to the ſaid Duke, being inraged by that their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer practice, and being arrived to great height and influence in the Adminiſtration of Your Majeſties Affairs in <hi>Scotland,</hi> did thereupon reſolve on a Deſigne of getting
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48501:53"/>Money for himſelf alſo from them, as will appear to your Majeſty by the following Narration; but the Magiſtrates at that time, and ſuch others as had then the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Influence in the Adminiſtration of Affairs in that Town, being honeſt Men of good Fortunes, and not to be brought to comply with his Deſign, he bethought himſelf of all ways to vex them; and knowing they did much value the Proſperity of the Town, he thought that the firſt means for promoting that his Deſign, was to have them threatned with removing Your Majeſties <hi>Publique Judicatures</hi> from that City to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and perſwaded his Brother the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> to move Your Majeſty to that purpoſe; but being diſappointed of that project by Your Majeſties Royal Wiſdom, Your Majeſty looking upon it as if it were to declare to the World that You were jealous of ſo great a Part of that Your Ancient Kingdom, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himſelf of new ways to accompliſh his Deſign, for which he judged no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo proper and effectual, as to diſturb them in the choice of their Magiſtrates and Town-Counſel; and by all means poſſible to get ſome of his own chuſing, fit for his own ends, brought into the Adminiſtration of the Affairs of that City. In order to which, being impatient of any longer delay, he laid hold of what follows, being the firſt occaſion that offer'd, though a very frivolous one.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Michaclmas</hi> 1674, The ſaid City of <hi>Edenbourgh</hi> being to go about the Election of their Magiſtrates for the enſuing year, there was procured a Letter from Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to Your Privy Counſel, commanding them to forbid the Magiſtrates and Town Counſel to proceed in their Elections, but to continue the Magiſtrates that then were, till Your Majeſty's further pleaſure ſhould be known; the reaſon ſuggeſted to Your Majeſty for it, was taken from this Circumſtance, That the Election ought to be made upon the Tueſday after <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and (it happening this year that <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> fell to be on a Tueſday) they were reſolved to proceed to their Elections upon <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-day.</p>
            <p>Though this was a very ſmall Matter, and upon very good and prudent Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, reſolved, as will afterward appear, yet was it repreſented to Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty as a Factious Deſign, and an Innovation of dangerous Conſequence, tending to create and maintain Faction in that City, contrary to Your Majeſties Service. Your Majeſties foreſaid Letter being intimated to the Magiſtrates and Town-Counſel, they did immediately give exact obedience to the ſame.</p>
            <p>They did alſo repreſent to Your Majeſties Privy Council, the Rights that they had for chuſing their own Magiſtrates, which had been granted to them by many of Your Majeſties Royal Anceſtors, and confirmed by many Parliaments; by vertue of which they humbly conceived they ought to be ſuffered to proceed in their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>They did alſo repreſent to Your Majeſties Privy Council, the Reaſons which had moved them to reſolve of making their Elections on the ſaid Tueſday, being <hi>Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elmas</hi> day, which in ſhort were, that by their Conſtitution they were obliged upon the Friday before <hi>Michaelmas</hi> to make the Liſt out of which the Magiſtrates are to be choſen; after the doing of which there is a Surceaſe and Vacation of all ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Courts of <hi>Judicature</hi> within the Town, and the whole time is ſpent by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People and Tradeſmen of the Town, in Rioting and Drinking, until the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions be finiſhed, which in this caſe would have been Twelve days; which they did in Prudence think they ought to ſhorten, not conceiving it contrary in the leaſt to the eſtabliſhed Rules of their Election.</p>
            <p n="2">2. On theſe things they did humbly crave Your Majeſties Privy Council would be pleaſed to repreſent to Your Majeſty, that thereby they might be freed from the ſuſpicion of any Factious Deſign, with which they were charged by the ſaid Letter.</p>
            <p>This being, through the Influence of the Lord <hi>Hatton,</hi> refuſed by the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, they diſpatched a Gentleman to the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> with Letters and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions full of Reſpect and Submiſſion to his Grace.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman at his firſt arrival found Duke <hi>Lauderdale</hi> very kind, and was made believe he ſhould be quickly diſpatched with Anſwers according to his Deſire; but ſome Delays having fallen in, the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> fell likewiſe upon thoughts of getting Money from the Town upon this occaſion, and therefore pretending ſtill more and more kindneſs to the ſaid Gentleman; he did firſt by ſome Inſinuations let fall to him his expectation, and at laſt flatly asked him if he had not brought a heavy Purſe with him; which when he underſtood, he was not to expect, he changed his Method, and grew harſher; and having detained him Five or Six Weeks, he the ſaid Duke entered into Conſultation with his old Friend Sir <hi>Andrew Ramſey,</hi> how to order the Affair. By his Advice he did write a Letter and ſent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals to the ſaid Town, That they ſhould give Bond and Security, That the Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48501:54"/>ſhould live regularly as to all matters Eccleſiaſtical in the largeſt extent, as the ſame is determined by the late Acts of Parliament; and to keep the Town free of all ſorts of Tumults, either of Man or Woman: Judging that this was impoſſible for them to perform, and unfavourable to attempt, and that therefore it would oblige them to make offers of Money.</p>
            <p>This Letter was all the Gentleman could obtain, and having gone back to <hi>Scotland</hi> and delivered it to the Magiſtrates, they were ſo far from being carried in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, that they were glad of that opportunity to witneſs their Zeal to ſerve Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; for they did very heartily comply with what was propoſed concerning the Bonds and Securities demanded; and immediately urged that Your Majeſties Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Lawyers would cauſe draw ſuch Bonds and Securities as was fit for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; offering good Security for great ſumms of Money for the performance. But this not being the thing truly intended, their ready Compliance with it, ſet them yet farther off from their deſired Settlement, and ſerved for no other intent than to cauſe the Lord <hi>Hatton</hi> to double his diligence to find out new means to molleſt them; to which end it was alledged by him, that they had of old forfeited their Priviledges and Liberties by ſome great Miſdemeanour, and that therefore they had not right to chuſe their own Magiſtrates, for which he would needs have their Records ſearched; and accordingly they themſelves, with their Books and Records, were in a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual manner brought often before him and his Friends, though they had not Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for it, to the great Diſturbance and Annoyance of the Citizens, by being abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly jealous of their Liberties, were with no ſmall care kept within the due Bounds of Moderation, by the Loyalty and Vigilancy of their Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>They the ſaid Magiſtrates, finding how they were uſed at home by the Lord <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> did again apply themſelves to the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> both by private Letters to the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> and his Dutcheſs, from ſome of the moſt eminent of them, full of Aſſurances of particular Reſpect to their Graces, and by a publick Letter to him from the whole Town-Council, offering Bond and Security to him in the terms propoſed by his fore-mentioned Letter. But this could not prevail, it being objected to them, from ſome frivolous things the Lord <hi>Hatton</hi> had ſcraped together out of their old Records, that they had loſt their Liberties, and that the right of chuſing their Magiſtrates did no more belong to them.</p>
            <p>Then did they produce their Charters, and did convincingly clear all Miſtakes, and evidently make appear that the right of chuſing their own Magiſtrates did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to them undoubtedly and intirely.</p>
            <p>All theſe things being cleared and open, they expected to be reſtored to the free exerciſe of their Election in their accuſtomed manner. They were ſtill kept off with Delayes, until the Lord <hi>Hatton,</hi> in purſuance of his Deſign, fell a practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with ſome few of themſelves, who did undertake with his aſſiſtance, to get ſuch Elected as were fit for his ends; whereupon he writes to his Brother the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> to move Your Majeſty for a Letter, and accordingly the Letter was procured from Your Majeſty upon the Seventh of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 75; wherein Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, after reciting Your former Orders in that Affair, did declare, that You were well informed of their Obedience to Your Commands, and of their dutiful Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in Your Concerns; and therefore ordained them, the next day after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of the Letter, to convene their whole Council, after their accuſtomed manner, and out of the Liſts already made, to Elect the Lord Provoſt, Bailies, and other Officers.</p>
            <p>According to which Letter, they did the next day proceed to their Elections, but inſtead of thoſe whom the Lord <hi>Hatton</hi> expected they would have choſen, they did Elect ſome men of good Fortunes and Integrity, not at all fit for his purpoſe (theſe who had ingaged to him not being men of that eſteem or influence as to be able to carry his Deſign as they had undertaken.)</p>
            <p>The new Magiſtrates and Council, did immediately after their Election, acquaint Your Majeſty with their Procedure, and gave Your Majeſty great Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Aſſurances of their care of the Peace of the Town, and of Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Service in all Matters, both Eccleſiaſtical and Civil.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Lord <hi>Hatton</hi> being exceedingly inraged at this Act of theirs, did by Advice of Sir <hi>George Mackynge,</hi> now Your Majeſties Advocate, ſend a Letter to the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale;</hi> to which he procured Your Majeſties Hand upon the 25th of the ſame month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> by which Your Majeſty ordered Your Privy Council to intimate to the Magiſtrates and Town-Council, that it was Your Royal Pleaſure that there ſhould be turned out of the Town-Council and declared inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any Publique Truſt in the ſaid Town, Twelve of the moſt eminent of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48501:54"/>the ſame Men with whom your Majeſty had expreſt your ſelf ſo well pleaſed, and whoſe Actings your Majeſty had approved, by your Letter of the Seventh of the ſaid Month.</p>
            <p>This was accordingly executed by the Privy-Council, without ever ſo much as calling before them the ſaid Perſons, though great Crimes were laid to their Charge, as being Factious Perſons, and miſ-repreſenting your Majeſty's Proceedings, without mentioning any particular Fact of theirs which could import any ſuch Crime. And though they be threatned by the ſaid Letter to be purſued for theſe great Crimes, and that your Majeſty's Advocate is commanded in the ſame to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt againſt them, yet could they never obtain from your Majeſty's Privy-Council that they ſhould be tryed for theſe things, though by a Petition ſigned by the whole Twelve, they did repreſent the great Prejudice they ſuſtained both in their Reputation and Trade, by being kept under ſuch Threatnings; and therefore did humbly offer themſelves to the ſtricteſt and ſevereſt Tryal. To which Petition they never received any Anſwer.</p>
            <p>To make appear to your Majeſty that theſe things were done for private and finiſtrous Deſigns, and not upon account of the ill effectedneſs, or factious Diſpoſitions of the Men, as was pretended; Your Majeſty is humbly prayed to take notice of theſe Particulars following.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There are three of the moſt conſiderable of theſe very Perſons who had been charged with ſo great Crimes, admitted ſince that time, by bribing the Dutcheſs of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> into a Truſt in your Majeſty's Affairs in <hi>Scotland,</hi> more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and conſiderable than any Truſt the Town of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> can confer, <hi>viz.</hi> The paying off your Majeſty's Forces, and bringing in your Majeſty's Exciſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, No ſooner were theſe Twelve Men turned out of the Town-Council, but after many great and eſſential Informalities (with the recital of which it is needleſs to trouble your Majeſty) they elected for Magiſtrates Men of no Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either for Parts, Eſtate, or Honeſty: And though theſe Bonds and Securities, which had been demanded from the others, and conſented to by them, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly pretended to be of great importance for your Majeſty's Service, yet they were not ſo much as once demanded, either by the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> or the Lord <hi>Hatton,</hi> from theſe Men who were now choſen.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Theſe new Magiſtrates were not long in their Seats, when off comes the Mask, and the true deſign of getting Money appears. For by an Act of the Town-Council there is about 5000 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> 
               <hi>Sterlin</hi> diſpoſed on amongſt their nameleſs Friends, which were the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> the Lord <hi>Hatton,</hi> and ſome other of their Friends. A great Sum to be got from that City, conſidering that the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> had got before that about 12000 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> 
               <hi>Sterlin</hi> from them.</p>
            <p>The Dutcheſs of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> did alſo ſince that time endeavour to get more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from them, and did with great Wrath threaten the Magiſtrates in plain Terms, for not giving her a Preſent, notwithſtanding all the Good ſhe ſaid ſhe had done for them, reckoning the Favours your Majeſty hath at any time been pleaſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon them, as done by her ſelf.</p>
            <p>Thus hath that poor Town been abuſed, and doth now lie, having Magiſtrates without either Conduct or Courage, in a time when the Diſorders of that Nation doth require Perſons to be imployed there of eminent Fidelity and Capacity to ſerve your Majeſty.</p>

               <hi>His Majeſty's Declaration for the Diſſolution of his late Privy Council, And for Conſtituting a New one, made in the Council-Chamber at</hi> White-<hi>Hall,</hi> April <hi>the twentieth,</hi> 1679.</head>
            <head type="sub">By His Majeſty's Special Command.</head>

               <salute>My Lords,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HIS Majeſty hath called you together at this time, to communicate unto you a Reſolution he hath taken in a matter of great Importance to his Crown and Government, and which he hopes will prove of the greateſt Satisfaction and Advantage to his Kingdoms in all Affairs hereafter, both at Home and Abroad; and therefore he doubts not of your Approbation, however you may ſeem concerned in it.</p>
            <pb n="100" facs="tcp:48501:55"/>
            <p>In the firſt place, His Majeſty gives you all Thanks for your Service to him here, and for all the good Advices you have given him, which might have been more frequent, if the great number of this Council had not made it unfit for the Secrecy and Diſpatch that are neceſſary in many great Affairs. This forced him to uſe a ſmaller number of your in a Foreign Committee, and ſometimes the Advices of ſome few among them (upon ſuch Occaſions) for many Years paſt. He is ſorry for the ill ſucceſs he has found in this Courſe, and ſenſible of the ill Poſture of Affairs from that, and ſome unhappy Accidents, which have raiſed great Jealouſies and Diſſatisfaction among his good Subjects, and thereby left the Crown and Government in a Condition too weak for thoſe Dangers we have reaſon to fear both at home and abroad.</p>
            <p>Theſe his Majeſty hopes may be yet prevented by a Courſe of wiſe and ſteady Counſels for the future, and theſe Kingdoms grow again to make ſuch a Figure as they have formerly done in the World, and as they may always do, if our Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Conduct were equal to our Force. To this end he hath reſolved to lay aſide the uſe he may have hitherto made of any ſingle Miniſtry or private Advices, or Foreign Committees for the general direction of his Affairs, and to conſtitute ſuch a Privy-Council, as may not only by its number be fit for the Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Digeſtion of all buſineſs both Domeſtick and Foreign, but alſo by the Choice of them out of the ſeveral Parts this State is compoſed of, may be the beſt informed in the true Conſtitutions of it, and thereby the moſt able to counſel him in all the Affairs and Intereſts of this Crown and Nation. And by the conſtant Advice of ſuch a Council, his Majeſty is reſolved hereafter to govern his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; together with the frequent uſe of his Great Council of Parliament, which he takes to be the true ancient Conſtitution of this State and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Now for the greater Dignity of this Council, his Majeſty reſolves their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant number ſhall be limited to that of Thirty. And for their greater Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there ſhall be Fifteen of his chief Officers who ſhall be Privy Counſellors by their places. And for the other Fifteen, he will chooſe Ten out of the ſeveral Ranks of the Nobility, and Five Commoners of the Realm, whoſe known Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, Intereſt and Eſteem in the Nation, ſhall render them without all ſuſpicion of either miſtaking or betraying the true Intereſts of the Kingdom, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of adviſing him ill.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place therefore, and to take care of the Church, his Majeſty will have the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> for the time being; and to inform him well in what concerns the Laws, the Lord Chancellor, and one of the Lord Chief Juſtices; For the Navy and Stores (wherein conſiſts the chief Strength and Safety of the Kingdom) the Admiral and Maſter of the Ordnance; for the Treaſury, the Treaſurer and Chancellor of the Exchequer (or when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any of theſe Charges are in Commiſſion, then the firſt Commiſſioner to ſerve here in their room) the reſt of the Fifteen, ſhall be the Lord Privy-Seal, the Maſter of the Horſe, Lord Steward and Lord Chamberlain of his Houſhold, the Groom of the Stole, and the two Secretaries of State. And theſe ſhall be all the Offices of his Kingdom to which the Dignity of Privy-Counſellor ſhall be annexed. The others his Majeſty has reſolved, and hopes he has not choſen ill. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty intends beſides, to have ſuch Princes of his Blood as he ſhall at any time call to this Board, being here in Court. A Preſident of the Council whenever he ſhall find it neceſſary, and the Secretary of <hi>Scotland,</hi> when any ſuch ſhall be here. But theſe being uncertain, he reckons not of the conſtant number of Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which ſhall never be exceeded.</p>
            <p>To make way for this new Council, his Majeſty hath now reſolved to Diſſolve this old one, and does hereby Diſſolve it, and from this time excuſes your farther attendance here, but with his repeated Thanks for your Service hitherto, and with the aſſurance of his Satisfaction in you ſo far, that he ſhould not have parted with you, but to make way for this new Conſtitution, which he takes to be, as to the Number and Choice, the moſt proper and neceſſary for the uſes he intends them. And as moſt of you have Offices in his Service, and all of you particular Shares in his Favour and good Opinion, ſo he deſires you will continue to exerciſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them, with the ſame Diligence and good Affections that you have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to done, and with confidence of his Majeſty's Kindneſs to you, and of thoſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies you ſhall receive of it upon other occaſions.</p>
            <pb n="101" facs="tcp:48501:55"/>
            <p>Therefore upon the preſent Diſſolution of this Council, his Majeſty appoints and commands all thoſe Officers he hath named, to attend him here to morrow at Nine in the Morning, as his Privy-Council, together with thoſe other Perſons he deſigns to make up the number, and to each of whom he has already ſigned par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Letters to that purpoſe, and commands the Lord Chancellor to ſee them iſſued out accordingly, which is the Form he intends to uſe, and that hereafter they ſhall be ſigned in Council, ſo that nothing may be done unadviſedly in the Choice of any Perſon to a Charge of ſo great Dignity and Importance to the Kingdom.</p>

            <p>WE, Your Majeſty's moſt Loyal and Obedient Subjects, the Commons in this Preſent Parliament aſſembled, having taken into our moſt ſerious Conſideration Your Majeſty's Gracious Meſſage brought unto us the ninth day of this inſtant <hi>November,</hi> by Mr. Secretary <hi>Jenkins,</hi> do with all thankfulneſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Your Majeſty's Care and Goodneſs in inviting us to expedite ſuch Matters as are depending before us relating to Popery and the Plot. And we do, in all Humility, repreſent to Your Majeſty, that we are fully convinced that it is highly incumbent upon us, in diſcharge both of our Duty to. Your Majeſty, and of that great Truſt repoſed in us, by thoſe whom we repreſent, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, by the moſt ſpeedy and effectual ways, the Suppreſſion of Popery within this Your Kingdom, and the bringing to publick Juſtice all ſuch as ſhall be found Guilty of the Horrid and Damnable Popiſh Plot. And though the Time of our Sitting (abating what muſt neceſſarily be ſpent in the chooſing and preſenting a Speaker, appointing Grand Committees, and in taking the Oaths and Teſts enjoyned by Act of Parliament) hath not much exceeded a Fortnight; yet we have in this Time not only made a conſiderable Progreſs in ſome things which to us ſeem, and (when preſented to Your Majeſty in a Parliamentary way) will, we truſt, appear to Your Majeſty, to be abſolutely neceſſary for the Safety of Your Majeſties Perſon, the effectual Suppreſſion of Popery, and the Security of the Religion, Lives, and Eſtates of Your Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects. But even in relation to the Tryals of the Five Lords impeached in Parliament for the Execrable Popiſh Plot, we have ſo far proceeded, as we doubt not but in a ſhort time we ſhall be ready for the ſame. But we cannot (without being unfaithful to Your Majeſty, and to our Country, by whom we are entruſted) omit, upon this occaſion, humbly to inform Your Majeſty, that our Difficulties, even as to theſe Tryals, are much encreaſed by the evil and deſtructive Councels of thoſe Perſons who adviſed Your Majeſty, firſt, to the Proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and then, to the Diſſolution of the laſt Parliament; at a time when the Commons had taken great pains about, and were prepared for thoſe Tryals. And by the like pernicious Councels of thoſe who adviſed the many and long Prorogations of the preſent Parliament, before the ſame was permitted to ſit; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48501:56"/>ſome of the Evidence which was prepared in the laſt Parliament may poſſibly (during ſo long an Interval) be forgotten or loſt, and ſome Perſons, who might probably have come in as Witneſſes, are either dead, have been taken off, or may have been diſcouraged from giving their Evidence. But of one miſchievous Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of thoſe dangerous and unhappy Councels we are certainly and ſadly ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, namely, That the Teſtimony of a material Witneſs againſt every of thoſe Five Lords (and who could probably have diſcovered and brought in much other Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence about the Plot in general, and thoſe Lords in particular) cannot now be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>vivâ voce.</hi> Foraſmuch as that Witneſs is unfortunately dead between the Calling and the Sitting of this Parliament: To prevent the like, or greater Inconveniences for the future, We make it our moſt humble Requeſt to Your Excellent Majeſty, that as You tender the Safety of Your Royal Perſon, the Security of Your Loyal Subjects, and the Preſervation of the True Proteſtant Religion, You will not ſuffer your Self to be prevailed upon by the like Councels to do any thing which may occaſion in conſequence (though we are aſſured never with Your Majeſties Intention) either the deferring of a full and perfect Diſcovery and Examination of this moſt wicked and deteſtable Plot, or the preventing the Conſpirators therein from being brought to ſpeedy and exemplary Juſtice and Puniſhment. And we humbly beſeech your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to reſt aſſured (notwithſtanding any Suggeſtions which may be made by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who, for their own wicked purpoſes, contrive to create a diſtruſt in your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of Your People,) That nothing is more in the Deſires, and ſhall be more the Endeavours of us, Your faithful and loyal Commons, than the promoting and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing of your Majeſties true Happineſs and Greatneſs.</p>

            <p>WE Your Majeſties moſt Obedient and Loyal Subjects, The Commons in Parliament Aſſembled, having with all Duty and Regard taken into our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Conſideration Your Majeſties late Maſſage relation to <hi>Tangier,</hi> cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the preſent Condition of it, as Your Majeſty is Pleaſed to repreſent in Your ſaid Meſſage, (after ſo vaſt a Treaſure expended to make it Uſeful) not only as one Infelicity more added to the afflicted Eſtate of Your Majeſties Faithful and Loyal Subjects, but as one reſult alſo of the ſame Councels and Deſigns which have brought Your Majeſties Perſon, Crown and Kingdoms into thoſe great and imminent Dangers, with which at this day they are ſurrounded; And we are the leſs ſurpriſed to hear of the Exigencies of <hi>Tangier,</hi> when we remember that ſince it became a part of Your Majeſties Dominions, it hath ſeveral times been under the Command of Popiſh Governours, (particularly for ſome time under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a Lord Impeached, and now Priſoner in the <hi>Tower</hi> for the Execrable and Horrid Popiſh Plot) That the Supplies ſent thither have been in great part made up of Popiſh Officers and Soldiers, and that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts amongſt the Soldiers of that Garriſon, have been the Perſons moſt Countenanced and Encouraged.</p>
            <p>To that part of your Majeſties Meſſage which expreſſes a reliance upon this Houſe for the ſupport of <hi>Tangier,</hi> and a recommendation of it to our ſpeedy care, We do with all humility and reverence give this Anſwer, That although in due Time and Order, we ſhall omit nothing incumbent on Us for the preſervation of every part of your Majeſties Dominions, and advancing the proſperity and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Eſtate of this your Kingdom; yet at this time, when a Cloud which has long threatned this Land is ready to break upon our heads in a ſtorm of Ruine and Confuſion, to enter into any further conſideration of this matter; eſpecially to come to any reſolutions in it, before we are effectually ſecured from the immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and apparent Dangers ariſing from the Power of Popiſh Perſons and Councils, We humbly conceive will not conſiſt either with our Duty to your Majeſty, or the Truſt repoſed in Us by thoſe we repreſent.</p>
            <p>It is not unknown to your Majeſty how reſtleſs the Endeavours, and how bold the Attempts of the Popiſh Party, for many years laſt paſt, have been, not only within this, but other your Majeſties Kingdoms, to introduce the Romiſh, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to extirpate the true Proteſtant Religion. The ſeveral Approaches they have made towards the compaſſing this their Deſign (aſſiſted by the Treachery of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious Proteſtants,) have been ſo ſtrangely ſucceſsful, that 'tis matter of Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Us, and which we can only aſcribe to an Over-ruling Providence, that your Majeſties Reign is ſtill continued over Us, and that We are yet aſſembled to conſult the means of our preſervation; This bloody and reſtleſs Party not content with the great Liberty they had a long time enjoyed to excerciſe their own Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion privately amongſt themſelves, to pertake of an equal Freedom of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Eſtates with your Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects, and of an Advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them, in being excuſed from chargeable Offices and Employments, hath ſo far prevailed, as to find countenance for an open and avowed practice of their Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and Idolatry, without controul, in ſeveral parts of this Kingdom. Great ſwarms of Prieſts and Jeſuits have reſorted hither, and have here exerciſed their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48501:57"/>and been daily tampering to pervert the Conſciences of your Majeſties Subjects. Their Oppoſers they have found means to diſgrace, and if they were Judges, Juſtices of the Peace, or other Magiſtrates, to have them turned out of Commiſſion: and in contempt of the known Laws of the Land, they have pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed upon people of all Ranks and qualities, and gained over divers to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; ſome openly to profeſs it, others ſecretly to eſpouſe it, as moſt conduced to the ſervice thereof.</p>
            <p>After ſome time they became able to influence matters of State and Government, and thereby to deſtroy thoſe they cannot corrupt. The continuance or Proroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Parliaments has been accommodated to ſerve the purpoſes of that Party. Money raiſed upon the People to ſupply your Majeſties extraordinary Occaſions, was by the prevalence of Popiſh Councils imployed to make War upon a Proteſtant State, and to advance and augment the dreadful Power of the French King, though to the apparent hazard of this, and all other Proteſtant Countries. Great numbers of your Majeſties Subjects were ſent into, and continued in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of that King, notwithſtanding the apparent Intereſt of your Majeſties King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, the Addreſſes of the Parliament, and your Majeſties gracious Proclamations to the contrary. Nor can We forbear to mention, how that at the beginning of the ſame War, even the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> were made Inſtruments to preſs upon that State, the acceptance of one demand, among others, from the French King for procuring their peace with him, that they ſhould admit the publick exerciſe of the Roman Catholick Religion in the United Provinces, the Churches there to be divided, and the Romiſh Prieſts maintained out of the publick Revenue.</p>
            <p>At home, if Your Majeſty did at any time by the Advice of Your Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, or of Your two Houſes of Parliament, Command the Laws to be put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution againſt Papiſts, even from thence they gained advantage to their Party, while the edge of thoſe Laws was turned againſt Proteſtant Diſſenters, and the Papiſts eſcaped in a manner untoucht. The Act of Parliament, enjoining a Teſt to be taken by all Perſons admitted into any Publick Office and intended for a ſecurity againſt Papiſts coming into Employment, had ſo little effect, that either by Diſpenſations, obtained from <hi>Rome,</hi> they ſubmitted to thoſe Teſts, and held their Offices themſelves, or thoſe put in their places, were ſo favourable to the ſame Intereſts, that Popery it ſelf has rather gained than loſt ground ſince that Act.</p>
            <p>But that their buſineſs in hand might yet more ſpeedily and ſtrongly proceed, at length a Popiſh Secretary (ſince Executed for his Treaſons) takes upon him to ſet afoot and maintain correſpondencies at <hi>Rome</hi> (particularly with a Native Subject of Your Majeſties, promoted to be a Cardinal) and in the Courts of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Forreign Princes (to uſe their own form of Speech) for the ſubduing that Peſtilent Hereſie, which has ſo long domineered over this Northern World; that is, to root the Proteſtant religion out of <hi>England,</hi> and thereby to make way the more eaſily to do the ſame in other Proteſtant Countries.</p>
            <p>Towards the doing this great Work, (as Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> was pleaſed to call it) Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits (the moſt dangerous of all Popiſh Orders to the Lives and Eſtates of Princes) were diſtributed to their ſeveral Precincts within this Kingdom, and held joint Councils with thoſe of the ſame Order in all Neighbour Popiſh Countries: Out of theſe Councils and Correſpondencies was hatcht that damnable and helliſh Plot, by the good Providence of Almighty God brought to light above two Years ſince, but ſtill threatning us; wherein the Traitors impatient of longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, reckoning the prolonging of Your Sacred Majeſties Life (which God long Preſerve) as the Great Obſtacle in the way to the Conſummation of their hopes, and having in their proſpect a Proſelyted Prince immediately to ſucceed in the Throne of theſe Kingdoms, reſolved to begin their Work with the Aſſaſſination of Your Majeſty, to carry it on with Armed Force, to deſtroy Your Proteſtant Subjects in <hi>England,</hi> to Execute a ſecond Maſſacre in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſo with eaſe to arrive at the ſuppreſſion of our Religion, and the ſubverſion of the Government.</p>
            <p>When this Accurſed Conſpiracy began to be diſcovered, they began the ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering it with the Barbarous Murther of a Juſtice of the Peace, within one of Your Majeſties own Palaces, who had taken ſome Examinations concerning it.</p>
            <p>Amidſt theſe diſtractions and fears, Popiſh Officers, for the Command of Forces were allowed upon the Muſters by ſpecial Orders (ſurreptitionſly obtained from Your Majeſty) but Counter-Signed by a Secretary of State, without ever paſſing under the Teſts preſcribed by the aforementioned Act of Parliament. In like manner above fifty new Commiſſions were granted about the ſame time to known Papiſts, beſides a great number of deſperate Popiſh Officers, though out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48501:58"/>yet entertain'd at half pay. When in the next Parliament the Houſe of Commons were prepared to bring to a legal Tryal the principal Conſpirators in this Plot, that Parliament was firſt Prorogued, and then Diſſolved. The Interval between the Calling and Sitting of this Parliament was ſo long, that now they conceive Hopes of covering all their paſt Crimes, and gaining a ſeaſonable time and advantages of practiſing them more effectually.</p>
            <p>Witneſſes are attempted to be corrupted, and not only promiſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but of the Favour of your Majeſty's Brother, made the Motives to their Compliance. Divers of the moſt conſiderable of your Majeſty's Proteſtant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects have Crimes of the higheſt nature forged againſt them, the Charge to be ſupported by Subornation and Perjury, that they may be deſtroyed by Forms of Law and Juſtice.</p>
            <p>A Preſentment being prepared for a Grand Jury of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> againſt your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's ſaid Brother the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> (under whoſe Countenance all the reſt ſhelter themſelves) the Grand Jury were in an unheard of and unpreſident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and illegal manner diſcharged; and that with ſo much haſte, and fear leſt they ſhould finiſh that Preſentment, that they were prevented from delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring many other Indictments by them at that time found againſt other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Recuſants. Becauſe a Pamphlet came forth Weekly, called, <hi>The Weekly Pacquet of Advice from</hi> Rome, which expoſes Popery (as it deſerves) as ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to the People, a new and arbitrary Rule of Court was made in your Majeſty's Court of King's Bench (rather like a Star-Chamber than a Court of Law) That the ſame ſhould not for the future be Printed by any Perſon whatſoever.</p>
            <p>We acknowledge your Majeſty's Grace and Care in iſſuing forth divers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations ſince the Diſcovery of the Plot, for the baniſhing Papiſts from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this great City, and Reſidence of your Majeſty's Court, and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but with trouble of Mind we do humbly inform your Majeſty, That notwithſtanding all theſe Prohibitions, great Numbers of them, and of the moſt dangerous Sort, to the Terrour of your Majeſty's Proteſtant Subjects, do daily reſort hither, and abide here. Under theſe and other ſad Effects and Evidences of the Prevalency of Popery, and its Adherents, We Your Majeſty's Faithful Commons found this your Majeſty's diſtreſſed Kingdom, and other parts of your Dominions labouring, when we aſſembled.</p>
            <p>And therefore from our Allegiance to your Majeſty, our Zeal to our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, our Faithfulneſs to our Country, and our Care of <hi>Poſterity,</hi> We have late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, upon mature deliberation, propoſed one Remedy of theſe Great Evils, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which (in our Judgments) all others will prove vain and fruitleſs, and (like all deceitful Securities againſt certain Dangers) will rather expoſe your Majeſty's Perſon to the greateſt hazard, and the people, together with all that's valuable to them as Men or Chriſtians, to utter Ruine and Deſtruction. We have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this Occaſion of an Acceſs to your Majeſty's Royal Preſence, humbly to lay before your Majeſty's great Judgment and Gracious Conſideration this moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deſign of introducing Popery, and, as neceſſary conſequences of it, all other Calamities, into your Majeſty's Kingdoms. And if after all this, the private Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of the ſubtle Accomplices of that Party and Deſign ſhould yet prevail, either to elude or totally obſtruct the faithful Endeavours of Us your Commons for an Happy Settlement of this Kingdom, We ſhall have this remaining Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, That we have freed our ſelves from the Guilt of that Blood and Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is like to enſue. But our only Hope, next under God, is in your Sacred Majeſty, That by your Great Wiſdom and Goodneſs, we may be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſecured from Popery, and all the Evils that attend it; and that none but perſons of known Fidelity to your Majeſty, and Sincere Affections to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, may be put into any Employment, Civil or Military; that whilſt we ſhall give a Supply to <hi>Tangier,</hi> we may be aſſured we do not augment the Strength of our Popiſh Adverſaries, nor encreaſe our own Dangers. Which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of your faithful Commons, if your Majeſty ſhall graciouſly vouchſafe to grant, We ſhall not only be ready to aſſiſt your Majeſty in Defence of <hi>Tangier,</hi> but do whatſoever elſe ſhall be in our Power to enable your Majeſty to protect the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion and Intereſt, at Home and abroad, and to Reſiſt and Repel the Attempts of your Majeſty's and the Kingdoms Enemies.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>May it pleaſe Your moſt Excellent Majeſty.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE your Majeſty's moſt Dutiful and Loyal Subjects, the Commons in this preſent Parliament Aſſembled, have taken into our ſerious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration your Majeſty's Gracious Speech to both your Houſes of Parliament, on the 15th of this inſtant <hi>December;</hi> and do with all the grateful Senſe of Faithful Subjects, and ſincere Proteſtants, acknowledge your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's great Goodneſs to us, in renewing the Aſſurances you have been pleaſed to give us of your readineſs to concur with us in any means for the Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Proteſtant Religion, and your Gracious Invitation of us to make our Deſires known to your Majeſty.</p>
            <p>But with grief of Heart we cannot but obſerve, that to theſe Princely Offers your Majeſty has been adviſed (by what Secret Enemies to Your Majeſty and your Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, we know not) to annex a Reſervation, which if inſiſted on, in the inſtance to which alone it is applicable, will render all your Majeſty's other Gracious Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of no effect or advantage to us. Your Majeſty is pleaſed thus to limit your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of concurrence in the Remedies which ſhall be propoſed, that they may conſiſt with preſerving the Succeſſion of the Crown in its due and legal courſe of Deſcent. And we do humbly inform your Majeſty, that no Interruption of that Deſcent has been endeavoured by us, except only the Deſcent upon the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who by the wicked Inſtruments of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> has been manifeſtly perverted to their Religion. And we do humbly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to your Majeſty, as the Iſſue of our moſt deliberate Thoughts, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations, that for the Papiſts to have their hopes continued, that a Prince of that Religion ſhall ſucceed in the Throne of theſe Kingdoms, is utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Safety of your Majeſty's Perſon, the Preſervation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, and the Proſperity, Peace and Welfare of your Proteſtant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p>That your Majeſty's Sacred Life is in continual danger, under the proſpect of a Popiſh Succeſſor, is evident, not only from the Principles of thoſe devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which allow that an Heretical Prince (and ſuch they term all Proteſtant Princes) Excommunicated and depoſed by the Pope, may be deſtroyed and murther'd; but alſo from the Teſtimonies given in the proſecution of the Horrid Popiſh Plot, againſt divers Traitors Attainted for deſigning to put thoſe accurſed Principles into practice againſt your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>
            <p>From the expectation of this Succeſſion, has the number of Papiſts in your Majeſty's Dominions ſo much encreaſed within theſe few years, and ſo many been prevailed with to deſert the true Proteſtant Religion, that they might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Favours of a Popiſh Prince, aſſoon as he ſhould come to the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Crown: and while the ſame Expectation laſts, many more will be in the ſame danger of being perverted.</p>
            <p>This it is that has hardned the Papiſts of this Kingdom, animated and confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated by their Prieſts and Jeſuits, to make a common Purſe, provide Arms, make application to Foreign Princes and ſollicite their Aid for impoſing Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon us; And all this even during your Majeſty's Reign, and while your Majeſty's Government, and the Laws were our protection.</p>
            <p>It is your Majeſty's Glory and true Intereſt, to be the Head and Protector of all <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as well abroad as at home: But if theſe Hopes remain, what Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances can be made for the advantage of the Proteſtant Religion and Intereſt, which ſhall give confidence to your Majeſty's Allies, to joyn ſo vigorouſly with your Majeſty, as the State of that Intereſt in the World now requires, while they ſee this <hi>Protestant Kingdom</hi> in ſo much danger of a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor;</hi> by whom at the preſent, all their Councils and Actions may be eluded, as hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they have been, and by whom, if he ſhould ſucceed) they are ſure to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed?</p>
            <pb n="108" facs="tcp:48501:59"/>
            <p>We have thus humbly laid before your Majeſty, ſome of thoſe great Dangers and Miſchiefs which evidently accompany the expectation of a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor.</hi> The certain and unſpeakable Evils which will come upon your Majeſty's <hi>Proteſtant Subjects</hi> and their poſterity, if ſuch a Prince ſhould inherit, are more alſo than we can well enumerate.</p>
            <p>Our Religion, which is now ſo dangerouſly ſhaken, will then be totally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown; Nothing will be left, or can be found to protect or defend it.</p>
            <p>The execution of old Laws muſt ceaſe, and it will be vain to expect new ones. The moſt ſacred Obligations of Contracts and Promiſes (if any ſhould be given) that ſhall be judged to be againſt the intereſt of the <hi>Romiſh Religion,</hi> will be viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; as is undeniable, not only from Argument and Experience elſewhere, but from the ſad experience this Nation once had on the like occaſion.</p>
            <p>In the Reign of ſuch a Prince, the Pope will be acknowledged Supream (though the Subjects of this Kingdom have ſworn the contrary) and all Cauſes, either as Spiritual, or in order to Spiritual Things, will be brought under his Juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>The Lives, Liberties, and Eſtates of all ſuch <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as value their Souls and their Religion more than their ſecular Concernments, will be adjudged forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>To all this we might add: That it appears in the diſcovery of the Plot, that Forreign Princes, were invited to aſſiſt in ſecuring the Crown to the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> with Arguments from his great Zeal to eſtabliſh Popery, and to extirpate Proteſtants (whom they call <hi>Hereticks</hi>) out of his Dominions; and ſuch will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect performance accordingly.</p>
            <p>We further humbly beſeech Your Majeſty, in Your great Wiſdom to conſider, Whether in caſe the Imperial Crown of this Proteſtant Kingdom, ſhould deſcend to the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> the oppoſition which may poſſibly be made to his poſſeſſing it, may not only endanger the farther deſcent in the Royal Line, but even Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy it ſelf.</p>
            <p>For theſe Reaſons, we are moſt humble Petitioners to your moſt Sacred Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, That in tender commiſeration of your poor Proteſtant people, Your Majeſty will be gratiouſly pleaſed to depart from the Reſervation in Your ſaid Speech; and when a Bill ſhall be tendred to your Majeſty, in a Parliamentary way, to diſable the Duke of <hi>York</hi> from inheriting the Crown, Your Majeſty will give your Royal Aſſent thereto; and as neceſſary to fortify and defend the ſame, that your Majeſty will likewiſe be gratiouſly pleaſed to Aſſent to an Act whereby your Majeſty's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Subjects may be enabled to Aſſociate themſelves for the defence of your Majeſty's Perſon, the Proteſtant Religion, and the Security of your Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>Theſe Requeſts we are conſtrained Humbly to make to your Majeſty as of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Neceſſity, for the ſafe and peaceable Enjoyment of our <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Without theſe things the Alliances of <hi>England</hi> will not be valuable, nor the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple encouraged to contribute to your Majeſties Service.</p>
            <p>As ſome farther means for the Preſervation both of our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Propriety;</hi> We are Humble Suiters to your Majeſty, that from henceforth ſuch Perſons onely may be <hi>Judges</hi> within the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> as are Men of Ability, Integrity, and known Affection to the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi> And that they may hold both their Offices and Sallaries, <hi>Quam diu ſe bene geſſerint.</hi> That (ſeveral Deputy-Lieutenants and Juſtices of the Peace, fitly qualified for thoſe Imployments, having been of late diſplaced, and others put in their room, who are Men of Arbitrary Principles, and Countenancers of <hi>Papiſts</hi> and Popery) ſuch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may bear the Office of a Lord-Lieutenant as are Perſons of integrity and known Affection to the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi> That Deputy-Lieutenants and Juſtices of the Peace may be alſo ſo qualified, and may be moreover Men of Ability, of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates and intereſt in their Countrey.</p>
            <p>That none may be Imployed as Military Officers, or Officers in your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Fleet, but Men of known Experience, Courage and Affection to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe our Humble Requeſts being obtained, we ſhall on our part be ready to Aſſiſt your Majeſty for the Preſervation of <hi>Tangier,</hi> and for putting your Majeſties Fleet into ſuch a Condition as it may preſerve your Majeſties <hi>Soveraignty</hi> of the Seas, and be for the Defence of the Nation.</p>
            <p>If your Majeſty hath or ſhall make any neceſſary Allyances for defence of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and Intereſt and Security of this Kingdom, this Houſe will be ready to Aſſiſt and ſtand by your Majeſty in the ſupport of the ſame.</p>
            <pb n="109" facs="tcp:48501:59"/>
            <p>After this our humble Anſwer to your Majeſties Gracious Speech, we Hope no evil Inſtruments whatſoever ſhall be able to leſſen your Majeſties Eſteem of that Fidelity and Affection we bear to your Majeſties Service; but that your Majeſty will always retain in your Royal Breaſt, that Favourable Opinion of us your Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Commons,</hi> that thoſe other Good Bills which we have now under Conſideration, Conducing to the Great Ends we have before mentioned; as alſo all Laws for the Benefit and Comfort of your People, which ſhall from time to time be tendred for your Majeſties Royal Aſſent, ſhall find acceptance with your Majeſty.</p>

            <head>The Report of the Committee of the Commons appointed to Examine the Proceedings of the Judges, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THis Committee being Inform'd, that in <hi>Trinity</hi>-Term laſt, the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> diſcharg'd the Grand Jury, that ſerv'd for the Hundred of <hi>Oſſulſton,</hi> in the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> in a very unuſual manner; proceeded to enquire into the ſame, and found by the Information of <hi>Charles Umfrevil,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Foreman of the ſaid Jury, <hi>Edward Proby, Henry Gerard,</hi> and <hi>John Smith,</hi> Centlemen, alſo of the ſaid Jury, That on the 21ſt of <hi>June</hi> laſt the Conſtables attending the ſaid Jury, were found Defective, in not preſenting the <hi>Papiſts</hi> as they ought, and thereupon were ordered by the ſaid Jury to make further Preſentments of them on the 26. following, on which Day the <hi>Jury</hi> met for that purpoſe; when ſeveral Peers of this Realm, and other Perſons of Honour and Quality, brought them a Bill againſt <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> for not coming to <hi>Church:</hi> But ſome exceptions being taken to that Bill, in that it did not ſet forth the ſaid Duke to be a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> ſome of the <hi>Jury</hi> Attended the ſaid perſons of Quality to receive ſatisfaction therein. In the mean time, and about an Hour after they had received the ſaid Bill, ſome of the <hi>Jury</hi> attended the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> with a Petition, which they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Court to preſent in their Name unto His Majeſty for the Sitting of this <hi>Parliament.</hi> Upon which the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scrogs</hi> raiſed many Scruples, and on pretence that they were not all in Court (tho' twenty of the <hi>Jury</hi> had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd the Petition) ſent for them, ſaying, he would diſpatch them preſently The <hi>Jury</hi> being come, and their Names called over, they renewed their Deſire that the Court would preſent their Petition: But the Chief Juſtice ask'd, if they had any Bills? they Anſwered, They had, but the Clerks were drawing them into Form: Upon which the Chief Juſtice ſaid, They would not make two Works of one Buſineſs: and the Petition being Read, he ſaid, This was no Article of their Charge, nor was there any Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> that required the Court to deliver the <hi>Grand Jury</hi>'s Petitions: That there was a <hi>Proclamation</hi> about them; And that it was not reaſonable the Court ſhould be obliged to run on their Errands: And he thought it much, that they ſhould come with a Petition to alter the Kings Mind de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the News Books. The <hi>Jury</hi> ſaid, They did it not to Impoſe on the Court, but (as other <hi>Juries</hi> had done) with all Submiſſion they deſired it: But the Court refuſed, bidding the Cryer return them their Petition: And Mr. Juſtice <hi>Jones</hi> told them, They had medled with Matters of State, not given them in Charge, but preſented no Bills of the Matters given in Charge. They anſwered as before, They had many before them, that would be ready in due time. Notwithſtanding which, the ſaid Juſtice <hi>Jones</hi> told them, They were Diſcharged from further Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. But <hi>Philip Ward</hi> (the Clerk that attended the ſaid <hi>Jury</hi>) cryed out, No, No, they have many Bills before them; for which the Court underſtanding (as it ſeems to this Committe) a ſecret Reaſon, which the Clerk did not, reproved him, Asking if he or they were to give the Rule there? The Cryer then told the Court, They would not receive their Petition; the Chief Juſtice bid him let it alone; ſo it was left there, and the <hi>Jury</hi> return'd to the Court-Houſe, and there found ſeveral Conſtables with Preſentments of <hi>Papiſts</hi> and other Offenders, as the <hi>Jury</hi> had directed them on the 21ſt before, but could not now receive the ſaid Preſentments, being diſcharged. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by much buſineſs was obſtructed, tho' none of the ſaid Informants ever knew the ſaid <hi>Jury</hi> diſcharged before the laſt day of the Term, which was not till Four days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And it further appeareth to the Committee, by the Evidences of <hi>Samuel Aſtrey, Jaſper Waterhouſe,</hi> and <hi>Philip Ward,</hi> Clerks, that have long ſerved in the ſaid Court, That they were much ſurpriſed at the ſaid diſcharging of the <hi>Jury,</hi> in that it was never done in their Memory before; and the rather, becauſe the ſaid

               <hi>Waterhouſe,</hi> as Secondary, conſtantly enters on that <hi>Grand Jury</hi>'s Paper that the laſt day of the Term is given them to return their Verdict on, as the laſt day but one is given to the other Two Grand <hi>Juries</hi> of that County, which Entry is as followeth;

            <p>Being the laſt day of the Term, and ſo in all the other Terms the laſt day is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which makes it appear to this Committee, That they were not in truth Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged for not having their Preſentments ready, ſince the Court had given them a longer day, but only to obſtruct their further Proceedings: And it appeareth by the Evidence aforeſaid to this Committee, that the four Judges of that Court were preſent at the Diſcharging of the ſaid <hi>Jury,</hi> and it did not appear that any of them did Diſſent therein; upon Conſideration whereof, the Committee came to this Reſolution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſolved,</hi> That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That the Diſcharging of the Grand <hi>Jury</hi> of the Hundred of <hi>Oſſulſton,</hi> in the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> by the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> in <hi>Trinity</hi>-Term laſt, before the laſt day of the Term, and before they had finiſht their Preſentments, was Illegal, Arbitrary, and an High Miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>This Committee proceeded alſo to inquire into a Rule of the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> lately made againſt the publiſhing a Book called, <hi>The weekly Pacquet of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice from</hi> Rome; or <hi>The Hiſtory of</hi> Popery: and <hi>Samuel Aſtrey.</hi> Gent. examined thereupon, inform'd this Committee, that the Author of the ſaid Book <hi>Henry Carr,</hi> had been informed againſt for the ſame, and had pleaded to the Information: But before it was Tryed, a Rule was made on a Motion, as he ſuppoſeth, againſt the ſaid book: All the Judges of that Court (as he remembers) being preſent, and none diſſenting. The Copy of which Rule he gave into this Committee, and is as followeth.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Dies Mercurij proxime poſt tres Septimanas, ſancte Trinitatis. Anno <hi>32 Car. 2.</hi> Regis.</p>
               <p>Ordinatum eſt quod liber intitulat, <hi>The Weekly Pacquet of Advice from</hi> Rome, <hi>or, The Hiſtory of</hi> Popery, non ulterius Imprimatur vel publicetur per aliquam Perſonam quamcunque Per Cur.</p>
            </q>
            <p>And this Committe admiring that Proteſtant Judges ſhould take offence againſt a Book whoſe chief deſign was to expoſe the Cheats and Foppery of Popery, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired further into it, and found by the Evidence of <hi>Jane Curtis,</hi> that the ſaid Book had been Licens'd for ſeveral Months, that her Husband paid for the Copy, and enter'd it in the Hall-Book of the Company: But for all this, ſhe could not prevail by theſe Reaſons with the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> to permit it any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; who ſaid, 'Twas a Scandalous Libel, and againſt the King's Proclamation, and he would ruine her if ever ſhe printed it any more. And ſoon after ſhe was ſerved with the ſaid Rule, as the Author and other Printers were; and by the Author's Evidence it appears, That he was taken and brought before the ſaid Chief Juſtice by his Warrant above a year ſince, and upon his owning he writ part of that Book, the Chief Juſtice called him Rogue, and other ill names; ſaying, he would fill all the Goals in <hi>England</hi> with ſuch Rogues, and pile them up as men do Faggots; and ſo committed him to priſon, refuſing ſufficient Bayl, and ſaying, he would Goal him to put him to charges; and his Lordſhip obſerved his word punctually therein, forcing him to his <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and then taking the ſame Bayl he refuſed before; upon which, this Committee came to this Reſolution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſolved,</hi> That it is the opinion of the Committee, that the Rule made by the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> in Trinity Term laſt, againſt printing a Book called, <hi>The Weekly Pacquet of Advice from</hi> Rome, is Illegal and Arbitrary.</p>
            <p>And the Committee proceeded further, and upon Information that a very great latitude had been taken of late by the Judges, in impoſing Fines on the perſons found Guilty before them, cauſed a Tranſcript of all the Fines impoſed by the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> ſince Eaſter Term in the 28th of His Majeſty's Reign, to be brought
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48501:60"/>before them from the ſaid Court by <hi>Samuel Aſtrey</hi> Gent. by peruſal of which, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to this Committee, That the quality of the Offence, and the Ability of the perſon found Guilty, have not been the Meaſures that have determined the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of many of theſe Fines, which being ſo very numerous, the Committee refer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to thoſe Records as to the general, inſtancing in ſome particulars, as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Joſeph Brown</hi> of <hi>London</hi> Gent. on an Information for publiſhing a printed Book called, <hi>The Long Parliament Diſſolved;</hi> in which is ſet forth theſe words:
<note place="margin">Trinit. 29, Car. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Nor let any man think it ſtrange, that we account it Treaſon for you to ſit and Act contrary to our Laws: for if in the first Parliament of</hi> Richard <hi>the ſecond,</hi> Grimes <hi>and</hi> Weſton <hi>for lack of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage only were adjudged guilty of High Treaſon for ſurrendring the places committed to their truſt; how much more you, if you turn Renegadoes to the people that intruſted you, and as much as in you lie ſurrender not a little pitiful Caſtle or two, but all the legal defence the people of</hi> England <hi>have for their Lives, Liberties, and Properties, at once. Neither let the vain preſuaſion delude you, That no perſident can be found, that one Engliſh Parliament hath hang'd up another; tho paradventure even that may be proved a miſtake; for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſidented Crime calls for an unpreſidented puniſhment; and if you ſhall be ſo wicked to do the one, or rather endeavour to do (for now you are no longer a Parliament) what ground of Confidence you can have that none will be found ſo worthy to do the other, we cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and do faithfully promiſe, if your unworthineſs provoke us to it, that we will uſe our honeſt and utmoſt endeavours (whenever a new Parliament ſhall be called) to chuſe ſuch as may convince you of your miſtake: the old and infallible Obſervation,</hi> That Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments are the pulſe of the people, <hi>ſhall loſe its eſteem: or you will find, that this your preſumption was over fond; however it argues but a bad mind to ſin, becauſe it's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it ſhall not be puniſhed.</hi> The Judgment was, That he be fin'd 1000 Marks, be bound to the good behaviour for ſeven years, and his name ſtruck out of the Roll of the Attorneys, without any offence alledged in his ſaid Vocation. And the publiſhing this Libel conſiſted only in ſuperſcribing a Pacquet, with this incloſed to the <hi>East Indies.</hi> Which Fine he not being able to pay (living only upon his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice) he lay in priſon for three years, till His Majeſty gratiouſly pardon'd him, and recommended him to be reſtored to his place again of Attorney, by His War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant dated the 15. of <hi>Decem.</hi> 1679.

            <p>Upon Conſideration whereof, this Committee came to this Reſolution:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſolv'd,</hi> That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That the Court of <hi>King</hi>'s-<hi>Bench</hi> (in the Impoſition of Fines on Offenders of late years) hath acted Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarily, Illegally and Partially, favouring Papiſts, and perſons Popiſhly affected, and exceſſively oppreſſing His Majeſty's Proteſtant Subjects.</p>
            <p>And this Committee being inform'd, That ſeveral of His Majeſty's Subjects had been committed for Crimes Bailable by Law, although they then-tendred ſufficient Sureties, which were refus'd, only to put them to vexation and charge, proceeded to enquire into the ſame, and found that not only the fore-mention'd <hi>Henry Carr</hi> had been ſo refus'd the common Right of a Subject, as is above-ſaid; but that <hi>George Broome,</hi> being a Conſtable laſt year in <hi>London,</hi> and committing ſome of the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi>'s Servants for great Diſorders, according to his Duty, he was in few days arreſted by a Tipſtaff, without any <hi>London</hi> Conſtable, and carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſaid Chief Juſtice by His Warrant, to anſwer for the committing of thoſe perſons above-ſaid; but being there, was accuſed of having ſpoken irreverently of the ſaid Chief Juſtice; and an <hi>Affidavit</hi> read to him to that purpoſe, which was falſly (as the ſaid <hi>George Broome</hi> affirms) Sworn againſt him by two perſons that uſe to be common Bail in that Court, and of very ill Reputation. Upon which he was committed to the <hi>Kings</hi>'s-<hi>Bench,</hi> though he then tendred two able Citizens and Common-Council-men of <hi>London</hi> to be his Bail: And he was forc't to bring his <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> to his great Charge, before he came out: When the Marſhal, Mr. <hi>Cooling,</hi> exacted 5 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> of him, of which he complain'd to the Chief Juſtice, but had no other Anſwer, But he might take his Remedy at Law. But the ſaid Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall, fearing he ſhould be queſtioned, reſtor'd him two Guinies of it.</p>
            <p>And further this Committee was inform'd by <hi>Francis Smith,</hi> Bookſeller, That about <hi>Michaelmas</hi> was Twelve-month he was brought before the ſaid Chief Juſtice by his Warrant, and charged by the Meſſenger, <hi>Robert Stephens,</hi> That he had ſeen ſome parcels of a Pamphlet, call'd, <hi>Obſervations on Sir</hi> George Wakeman'<hi>s Tryal,</hi> in his Shop: Upon which the Chief Juſtice told him, he would make him an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, uſe him like a Boar in <hi>France,</hi> and pile him and all the Bookſellers and Printers up in Priſon, like Faggots; and ſo committed him to the <hi>Kings</hi>'s-<hi>Bench:</hi> Swearing and Curſing at him in great fury. And when he tendred Three ſufficient Citizens of <hi>London</hi> for his Bail, alledging Impriſonment in his circumſtances would be his utter ruin; the Chief Juſtice replied, The Citizens lookt like ſufficient perſons, but he would take no Bail; and ſo he was forc't to come out by <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and was afterwards inform'd againſt for the ſame matter, to his great charge and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. And a while after <hi>Francis</hi> (the Son of the ſaid <hi>Francis Smith</hi>) was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the ſaid Chief Juſtice, and Bail refus'd, for ſelling a Pamphlet, call'd, <hi>A New-years Gift</hi> for the ſaid Chief Juſtice, to a Coffee-houſe; and he declared to them he would take no Bail, for he would ruin them all.</p>
            <pb n="109" facs="tcp:48501:61"/>
            <p>And further it appear'd to this Committee, that the ſaid Chief Juſtice (about <hi>October</hi> was twelve month) committed in like manner <hi>Jane Curtis,</hi> ſhe having a Husband and Children, for ſelling a Book call'd, <hi>A Satyr against Injuſtice,</hi> which his Lordſhip call'd a Libel againſt him; and her Friends tendring ſufficient Bail, and deſiring him to have mercy on her Poverty and Condition; he ſwore by the Name of God ſhe ſhould go to Priſon; and he would ſhew no more mercy than they could expect from a Woolf that came to devour them; and ſhe might bring her <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> and come out ſo: Which ſhe was forc'd to do; and after inform'd againſt and proſecuted to her utter ruin, four or five Terms after.</p>
            <p>In like manner it appeared to this Committee, that about that time alſo, <hi>Edward Berry</hi> (Stationer of <hi>Gray</hi>'s-<hi>Inn</hi>) was committed by the ſaid Chief Juſtice, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd of ſelling <hi>The Obſervations on Sir</hi> George Wakeman<hi>'s Tryal;</hi> and though he tendered 1000 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> Bail, yet the Chief Juſtice ſaid, he would take no Bail, he ſhould go to Priſon, and come out according to Law. And after he with much Trouble and Charge got out by <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> he was forc'd by himſelf, or his Attorney, to attend five Terms before he could be diſcharg'd, though no Information was Exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited againſt him in all that time. In Conſideration whereof, and of others of the like Nature, (too tedious here to relate) this Committee came to this Reſolution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſolved,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That the refuſing ſufficient Bail in theſe Caſes, wherein the Perſons Committed were Bailable by Law: Was Illegal, and a High Breach of the Liberty of the Subject.</p>
            <p>And this Committee being informed of an extraordinary kind of a Charge, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at the laſt Aſſizes at <hi>Kingſton</hi> (in the County of <hi>Surrey</hi>) by Mr. Baron <hi>Weſton,</hi> and proceeding to examine ſeveral Perſons then and there preſent: It was made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to this Committee, by the Teſtimony of <hi>John Cole, Richard Mayo,</hi> and <hi>John Pierce,</hi> Gentlemen, and others (ſome of whom put down the ſaid Barons words in Writing immediately) that part of the ſaid Charge was to this effect: He inveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very much againſt <hi>Farel, Luther, Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> condemning them as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the Reformation: Which was againſt their Princes minds, and then adding to this purpoſe, <hi>Zuinglius ſet up his Fanaticiſm, and</hi> Calvin <hi>built on that bleſſed Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And to ſpeak truth, all his Diſciples are ſeaſoned with ſuch a ſharpneſs of Spirit, that it much concerns Magiſtrates to keep a ſtrait hand over them: And now they are reſtleſs, amuſing us with Fears, and nothing will ſerve them but a Parliament: For my part, I know no Repreſentative of the Nation but the King; all Power Centers in him: 'Tis true, he does intruſt it with his Miniſters, but he is the ſole Repreſentative; and I-faith, he has wiſdom enough to intruſt it no more in theſe Men, who have given us ſuch late Examples of their Wiſdom and Faithfulneſs.</hi> And this Committee taking the ſaid matter into their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, came to this Reſolution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſolved,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That the ſaid Expreſſions in the Charge given by the ſaid Baron <hi>Weſton,</hi> were a Scandal to the Reformation, in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation of the Rights and Priviledges of Parliaments, and tending to raiſe Diſcord between his Majeſty and his Subjects.</p>
            <p>And this Committee being informed by ſeveral Printers and Bookſellers, of great Trouble and Vexation given them unjuſtly by one <hi>Robert Stephens,</hi> (called a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of the Preſs) the ſaid <hi>Stephens</hi> being examined by this Committee, by what Authority he had proceeded in that manner, produced two Warrants under the Hand and Seal of the Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs,</hi> which were, <hi>In haec verba:</hi>

                  <p>Upon view whereof this Committee came to this Reſolution.</p>
                  <p>Reſolved, <hi>That it is the Opinion of this Committee, That the ſaid Warrants are Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and Illegal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this Committee being informed of certain Scandalous Diſcourſes, ſaid to be uttered in publick places by the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs,</hi> proceeded to Examine Sir <hi>Robert Atkins,</hi> late one of the Juſtices of the Common Pleas, concerning the ſame, by whom it appears, That at a Seſſions-Dinner at the <hi>Old-Bayly</hi> (in the Maiorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Sir <hi>Robert Clayton</hi>) who was then preſent, the ſaid Chief Juſtice took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſpeak very much againſt Petitioning, condemning it as reſembling 41, as Factious and tending to Rebellion, or to that effect; to which the ſaid Sir <hi>Robert Atkins</hi> made no Reply, ſuſpecting he waited for ſome Advantage over him: But the Chief Juſtice continuing and preſſing him with the ſaid Diſcourſe, he began to juſtifie Petitioning as the Right of the People, eſpecially for the Sitting of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which the Law requires, if it be done with Modeſty and Reſpect. Upon which the Chief Juſtice fell into a great paſſion; and there is ſome reaſon to believe, that ſoon after he made an ill Repreſentation of what the ſaid Sir <hi>Robert</hi> had then ſpoke unto his Majeſty. And this Committee was further informed, That the ſaid
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48501:62"/>Sir <hi>Robert Atkins</hi> being in Circuit with the ſaid Chief Juſtice at Summer Aſſizes was Twelve-month, at <hi>Monmouth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

All which matters of Diſcourſe this Committee humbly Submit to the Wiſdom and Conſideration of this Houſe, without taking upon them to give any Opinion therein.</p>
                  <p>And this Committee proceeded further to inquire into ſome Paſſages that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at <hi>Lent Aſſizes</hi> laſt for the County of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> at the Tryal of <hi>Thomas Dare,</hi> Gent. there, upon an Indictment for ſaying falſly and ſeditiouſly, <hi>That the Subjects had but two means to Redreſs their Grievances, one by Petitioning, the other by Rebellion:</hi> And found, that though by his other diſcourſe when he ſaid ſo, that it appeared plainly he had no Rebellious intent, in that he ſaid, <hi>Then God forbid there ſhould be a Rebellion, he would be the first Man to draw his Sword againſt a Rebel;</hi> yet he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted with great violence: And having pleaded <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> he moved Mr. Juſtice <hi>Jones</hi> (who then ſate Judge there) that he might try it at the next <hi>Aſſizes,</hi> for that Mr. <hi>Searle</hi> (who was by at the ſpeaking of the words, and a material Witneſs for his Defence) was not then to be had, and an <hi>Affidavit</hi> to that purpoſe was made and received.

And further affirmed, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was the True Catholick Church. He further endeavoured to prove Extream Unction, and Auricular Confeſſion, as well as he could, out of the Epiſtles. Further, he hath heard him ſay,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48501:64"/>The King was a Perſon of mean and ſoft Temper, and could be led eaſily to any thing, but yet a <hi>Solomon</hi> in vices; but that the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> was a Prince of a brave Spirit, would be faithful to his Friends, and that it was our own Faults that he was a Roman Catholick, in that we forc'd him to fly into <hi>France,</hi> where he imbraced that Religion: About the ſame time, he the ſaid <hi>Thompſon,</hi> ſaid the Church would be Militant, but greatly commended the Decency of Solemnizing the Maſs in <hi>France;</hi> and that it was performed with much more Reverence and Devotion than any other Religion doth uſe. He further heard him ſay in a Sermon, about the time of Petitioning, he would rather cut off his hand than Sign it, and had many bad Expreſſions of it; that it was, the Seed of Rebellion and like 40 and 41: And further, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> at one <hi>Sandford</hi>'s Shop door in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Bedlow,</hi> ſaid, That he was not to be believ'd, becauſe <hi>Bedlow</hi> had, ſaid he, meaning Mr. <hi>Thompſon,</hi> was at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Thomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> ſaid he was not; and that <hi>Bedlow</hi> was of a bad Life, and in many Plots, and not to be credited in any thing he ſaid: And that in another Diſcourſe he commended the Romiſh Clergy for their ſingle Life, and is himſelf ſo; and did at the ſame time Vilify and Rail at the Engliſh Clergy for Marrying; ſaying, It was better for a Clergy-Man to be Guelt, than to Marry, and that the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> in <hi>France</hi> were Letcherous Fellows, and could ſcarce be two years a Prieſt without a Wife. About the time and after the Election of Sir <hi>John Knight</hi> to this Parliament, Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> ſaid, he was not fit to be believ'd, and as bad as any Fanatick. He further ſaid in the Pulpit at St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s, that after Excommunication by the Biſhop, without Abſolution from the Spiritual Court, ſuch a one was ſurely Damned; and he would pawn his Soul for the Truth of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> after the Evidence given by every particular Perſon Face to Face, was asked to every one, If he had any Queſtions to ask, before they called another? Who anſwer'd, He ſhould not ſay any thing at preſent. When the Witneſſes before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, were all Examined, Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> being deſir'd to make his Defence, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare whether he were Guilty of the Matters laid to his charge; did for the greateſt part confeſs words ſpoken to that effect; and in other things endeavoured to turn the words with more favour towards himſelf; but the Witneſſes being of great Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and many more being ready to have made good the ſame things, the Committee look'd upon the buſineſs to be of a high Nature, and therefore ordered the matter to be reported ſpecially; leaving it to the Wiſdom of the Houſe.</p>

               <p>THat Your Majeſty's great Council in Parliament, having in their late Seſſion, in purſuance of Your Majeſty's Direction, entred upon a ſtrict and impartial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the horrid and execrable Popiſh Plot, which hath been for ſeveral years laſt paſt, and ſtill is, carried on for deſtruction of Your Majeſty's Sacred Perſon
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48501:67"/>and Government, and extirpation of the Proteſtant Religion, and the utter Ruine of Your Majeſty's Proteſtant Subjects; and having ſo far proceeded therein, as juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to attaint upon full Evidence, one of the five Lords impeached for the ſame, and were in further Proſecution of the remaining Four Lords, and other Conſpirators therein.</p>
               <p>And as well the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, as the Commons in Your ſaid Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament aſſembled having Declared, That they are fully ſatisfied, that there now is, and for divers years laſt paſt, hath been a horrid and Treaſonable Plot and Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy contrived and carried on by thoſe of the Pupiſh Religion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacring the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ſubverting the Proteſtant Religion, and the Ancient eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Government of that Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And Your ſaid Commons having Impeached the Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> in order to the bringing him to Juſtice for the ſame; And having under Examination other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators in the ſaid <hi>Iriſh</hi> Plot.</p>
               <p>And Your ſaid Commons having likewiſe impeached Sir <hi>William Scroggs,</hi> Chief Juſtice of Your Majeſty's Court of Kings Bench, for Treaſon and other great Crimes and Miſdemeanors, in endeavouring to ſubvert the Laws of this Kingdom by his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary and Illegal proceedings; And having voted Impeachments againſt ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Judges for the like Miſdemeanors.</p>
               <p>Your Petitioners conſidering the continual Hazards to which Your Sacred Life, and the Proteſtant Religion, and the Peace of this Kingdom are expoſed, while the Hopes of a Popiſh Succeſſor, gives Countenance and Encouragement to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiratours in their wicked Deſigns. And conſidering alſo the Diſquiet and Dreadful Apprehenſions of Your good Subjects, by reaſon of the Miſeries and Miſchiefs which threaten them on all parts; as well from Foreign Powers, as from the Conſpiracies within Your ſeveral Kingdoms, againſt which no ſufficient Remedy can be provided but by Your Majeſty and Your Parliament, were extreamly ſurprized at the late Prorogation, whereby the Proſecution of the Publick Juſtice of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the making the Proviſions neceſſary for the Preſervation of Your Majeſty, and Your Proteſtant Subjects, hath received an interruption. And they are the more affected herewith, by reaſon of the Experience they have had of the great Progreſs, which the emboldned Conſpirators have formerly made in their Deſigns, during the late frequent Receſſes of Parliament. But that which ſupports them againſt Diſpair, is the Hopes they derive from Your Majeſty's Goodneſs, That Your Intention was, and does continue by this Prorogation, to make way for Your bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Concurrence with the Counſels of Your Parliament.</p>
               <p>And Your Petitioners humbly hope, That Your Majeſty will not take Offence, that your Subjects are thus Zealous, and even impatient of the leaſt Delay of the long hoped for Security, whilſt they ſee your precious Life invaded, the true Religion undermined, their Families and innocent Poſterity likely to be ſubjected to Blood, Confuſion, and Ruine; and all theſe Dangers encreaſed, by reaſon of the late En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of Your Majeſty, and Your Parliament, which have added Provocation to the Conſpirators, but have had little or no Effect towards ſecuring againſt them; And they truſt Your Majeſty will graciouſly accept this Diſcovery and Deſire of their Loyal Hearts to preſerve Your Majeſty, and whatever elſe is dear to them, and to ſtrengthen Your Majeſty againſt all Popiſh and Pernicious Counſels, which any ill affected Perſons may perſume to offer.</p>
               <p>They do therefore moſt humbly Pray, That Your Majeſty will be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pleaſed (as the only means to quiet the Minds, and extinguiſh the Fears of Your Proteſtant People, and prevent the imminent Dangers which threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Your Majeſty's Kingdoms, and particularly this Your Great City, which hath already ſo deeply ſuffered for the ſame) to permit Your ſaid Parliament to Sit, from the Day to which they are Prorogued, untill by their Counſels and Endeavours thoſe good Remedies ſhall be provided, and thoſe juſt Ends attained, upon which the Safety of Your Majeſty's Perſon, the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Proteſtant Religion, the Peace and Settlement of Your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and the Welfare of this Your Ancient City, do ſo abſolutely depend. For the purſuing and obtaining of which good Effects, Your Petitioners un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animouſly do offer their Lives and Eſtates.</p>

               <hi>THe Lords here preſent, together with divers other Peers of the Realm, taking notice that by Your late Proclamation, Your Majeſty has declared an intention of calling a</hi> Parliament <hi>at</hi> Oxford; <hi>and obſerving from Hiſtory and Records, how unfortunate many Aſſemblies have been, when called at a Place remote from the Capital City; as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the Congreſs in</hi> Henry <hi>the Second's time at</hi> Clarendon; <hi>Three ſeveral Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at</hi> Oxford <hi>in</hi> Henry <hi>the Third's time, and at</hi> Coventry <hi>in</hi> Henry <hi>the Sixth's time; With divers others which have proved very fatal to thoſe Kings, and have been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with great miſchief on the whole Kingdom: And conſidering the preſent poſture of affairs, the many jealouſies and diſcontents, which are amongſt the People, We have great Cauſe to apprehend, that the conſequences of a Parliament now at</hi> Oxford <hi>may be as fatal to Your Majeſty and the Nation, as thoſe others mentioned have been to the then Reigning Kings, and therefore we do conceive that we cannot anſwer it to God, to Your Majeſty, or to the People, If we, being Peers of the Realm, ſhould not on ſo Important an Occaſion humbly offer our advice to Your Majeſty; that if poſſible, Your Majeſty may be prevailed with, to alter this (as we apprehend) unſeaſonable Reſolution The Grounds and Reaſons of our Opinion, are contained in this our Petition, which We humbly Preſent to Your Majeſty.</hi>

               <hi>To the</hi> King's moſt Excellent Majeſty. <hi>The Humble Petition and Advice of the Lords under-named, Peers of the Realm.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>Humbly Sheweth,</opener>
            <p>THat whereas Your Majeſty hath been pleaſed, by divers Speeches, and Meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to Your Houſes of Parliament, rightly to repreſent to them the Dangers that Threatned Your Majeſty's Perſon, and the whole Kingdom, from the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, and wicked Plots of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and the ſudden Growth of a Foreign Power, unto which, no ſtop or remedy could be Provided, unleſs it were by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and an Union of Your Majeſty's <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Subjects, in one Mind, and one Intereſt.</p>
            <p>And the Lord <hi>Chancellor,</hi> in Purſuance of Your Majeſty's Commands, having more at large Demonſtrated the ſaid Dangers to be as great, as we in the midſt of our Fears could Imagine them: and ſo preſſing, that our Liberties, Religion, Lives, and the whole Kingdom would be certainly Loſt, if a ſpeedy Proviſion were not made againſt them.</p>
            <p>And Your Majeſty, on the 21ſt. of <hi>April,</hi> 1679. Having called unto your Council, many Honourable and Worthy Perſons, and declared to them and the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48501:70"/>whole Kingdom, That being ſenſible of the evil Effects of a ſingle Miniſtry, or private Advice, or Forreign Committee, for the General Direction of your Affairs; Your Majeſty would for the future Refer all things unto that Council, and by the conſtant Advice of them, together with the frequent uſe of your great Council, the <hi>Parliament,</hi> Your Majeſty was hereafter Reſolved to Govern the Kingdoms; We began to hope we ſhould ſee an end of our Miſeries.</p>
            <p>But to our unſpeakable Grief and Sorrow, we ſoon found our Expectations Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated. The <hi>Parliament,</hi> then ſubſiſting, was Prorogued and Diſſolved, before it could perfect what was intended for our Relief and Security; and though another was thereupon called, yet by many Prorogations it was put off, till the 21ſt. of <hi>October</hi> paſt; and notwithſtanding Your Majeſty was then again pleaſed to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that neither Your Perſon, nor Your Kingdom could be ſafe, till the matter of the Plot was gone thorow, It was unexpectedly Prorogued on the 10th. of this <hi>Month,</hi> before any ſufficient Order could be taken therein; all their Juſt and Pious Endeavours to ſave the Nation were overthrown; the good Bills they had been In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly preparing to Unite all Your Majeſties <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Subjects brought to nought; The diſcovery of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Plot ſtifled; The Witneſſes that came in fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently more fully to declare That, both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> diſcouraged. Thoſe Forreign Kingdoms and States, who by a happy conjunction with us, might give a Check to the <hi>French</hi> Power, diſheartned, even to ſuch a Deſpair of their own Security againſt the growing greatneſs of that Monarch, as we fear may induce them to take new Reſolutions, and perhaps ſuch as may be fatal to us: The Strength and Courage of our Enemies both at home and abroad increaſed; and our ſelves left in the utmoſt danger of ſeeing our Country brought into utter Deſolation.</p>
            <p>In theſe <hi>Extremities,</hi> we had nothing under God to comfort us, but the Hopes, that Your Majeſty (being touched with the Groans of Your periſhing People) would have ſuffered Your Parliament to meet at the Day unto which it was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued: and that no further interruption ſhould have been given to their Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in Order to their ſaving of the Nation. But that failed us too: For then we heard that Your Majeſty, by the private ſuggeſtion of ſome <hi>Wicked Perſons, Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of Popery,</hi> Promoters of <hi>French Deſigns,</hi> and <hi>Enemies</hi> to Your Majeſty and the Kingdom (without the Advice, and as we have good Reaſon to believe, againſt the Opinion, even of Your <hi>Privy-Council</hi>) had been prevailed with to <hi>Diſſolve it,</hi> and to call another to meet at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where neither Lords nor Commons can be in Safety, but will be daily expoſed to the Sword of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and their Adherents, of whom too many are crept into Your Majeſties <hi>Guards.</hi> The Liberty of ſpeaking according to their Conſciences, will be thereby Deſtroyed, and the Validity of all their Acts and Proceedings conſiſting in it, left Diſputable. The Straitneſs of the Place, no way admits of ſuch a concourſe of Perſons, as now follows every Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> which are neceſſary to give Evidence againſt the Popiſh Lords, ſuch Judges, or others whom the Commons have Impeached, or had reſolved to Impeach, can neither bear the <hi>Charge</hi> of going thither, nor truſt themſelves under the Protection of a Parliament, that is it ſelf Evidently under the power of <hi>Guards</hi> and <hi>Soldiers.</hi>

That there are in that Pamphlet in relating the manner of the Election ſome galling Truths, or if you pleaſe Reflections, which poſſibly had better been ſpared, and therefore no wiſe man would own the making it. But for the Addreſs it ſelf 'tis certain, That it was agreed upon, conſented unto, and will be Juſtified by the far greater part of the Electors of this Antient and Eminently Loyal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, of which 'twas thought fit here to give this brief Account, for obviating any ſlanderous Objection that might be made on that occaſion.</p>

            <p n="4">4. That you proceed to the Tryal of the <hi>Popiſh Lords,</hi> together with all other Criminal Offenders, and go on ſifting to the bottom that Execrable Plot, which hath been, and we muſt fear <hi>ſtill</hi> is carried on, to take away His Majeſty's Life (whom God long preſerve) to root out the Fundamental Laws of this Realm, as alſo to introduce Popery into the Church, and Tyranny into the State.</p>
            <p n="5">5.

               <salute>Gentlemen and Countrymen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Muſt acknowledge that God hath been good unto me from my Cradle to this moment, and of all his Providences to me, there is none for which I have greater reaſon to bleſs his Holy Name, than that he hath enabled me to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern my ſelf and actions ſo, as to gain your good opinion and kindneſs; and I cannot but own I have your favour accompanied with all the obliging Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances imaginable: for the firſt time that you were pleaſed to command my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was in the Eighteen Years Parliament, upon the death of Sir <hi>Foulk Lucy,</hi> who had ſerved you faithfully in that Parliament; and though I was raw and unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with thoſe affairs, and without any Tryal of my Integrity, you ventured all you had in my hands at a time when <hi>England</hi> was in danger to be loſt for want of a Vote: For that Parliament chiefly conſiſted of ſuch as ſold their Country for private advantage, and would have ſold their King too, if they could have made a better market; I ſerved you ſome time in that parliament, at laſt it was Diſſolved, and a new one called, and then as if you had approved of what I did, you thought fit to imploy me again in that Service; though you laid him aſide who had been my Collegue; that Parliament continued not long, but was Diſſolved, and a new one called; and then again a third time you thought me fit to repreſent you in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, though as you had done before you ſet him aſide whom you had ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with me, and Choſe a new one in his room; but why you did me ſo Singular an honour as to continue me in your Service two Parliaments together, and did not the like to the other Gentlemen, it is not for me to give the reaſons of it, thoſe are beſt known to your ſelves. This is now the fourth time that I have waited on you on the like occaſion, and it is not a leſſening of your former kindneſs, that you have not changed my former Partner; but rather a Confirmation of it, becauſe that the firſt time you have continued him is when he appears to be of my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that which ſtill adds weight to your kindneſs is, that notwithſtanding all this ſtir, this buſtle, this unneceſſary Charge and expence, all the Stories by which I have been traduced, you have not been prevailed upon to withdraw or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh your favour.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, I humbly beg your Patience to ſpeak a few words in anſwer to what they ſay of me, leſt by Silence I may ſeem to cry Amen to their reports and Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; the firſt thing they reported, was, that I would not ſtand again, but would
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48501:79"/>decline your Service: but withall they give no reaſon for it, only it is ſo becauſe they ſaid it; but what reaſon there is to contradict them now who ſaid ſo the laſt time, and how true it was you well remember. So that this being the Second time that they have told you the ſelf ſame falſhoods, I hope for the future that others will believe them as little as you have done. It was reported that I was kill'd without giving any reaſons or circumſtances, and that to this alſo they expected an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit belief; I wiſh they are not for an implicit faith in all things. It was truly an excellent Artifice to threap you out of your Votes; yet had I been kill'd, had it been for your Service, I ſhould have thought my ſelf well beſtowed, and rather meet than avoid the occaſion of my Death. They tell you alſo that I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the King, but they do not tell you that I am reſtored to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ny former Station of my Commiſſion of the Peace, without ſeeking or deſiring it, it cannot be imagined that his Majeſty would be ſo Gracious to a man of whom he hath an ill opinion, and it is a reflection to his Majeſty to think he will do a thing of that Nature out of any regard whatſoever, but when a thing carries its weight and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with it, ſo that by this you may diſcern how all their reports are grounded, being rather the effects of their deſires than that the thing is truly ſo.</p>
            <p>It ſeems the Gentlemen are much diſpleaſed that this County have frequently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thoſe of my Family to ſerve them in Parliament, they call it an entailing upon the Family, but they are not pleaſed to vouchſafe the reaſons why the Son may not be imployed as well as the Father, in caſe he proves as fit for it; but the truth is they would govern you, and are angry that you will be your own chuſers; yet whether in this they deſign to ſerve you or their own ends, I ſubmit to your Judgment; but as to my own particular, they think the County highly — that I have ſerved you in ſeveral Parliaments. Alas Gentlemen, I know I am much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour in Parts and Learning to a great many, but in ſaithfulneſs to your intereſt, I will ſubmit to no man; but if you would obſerve it, they would impoſe that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you which they would not have done to themſelves. If they have a Servant who hath ſerved them faithfully, they would not take a new one in his room be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have entertained him ſeveral years; but you muſt change your Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as oft as you have new Parliaments, though they ſerve you well, and you ought to hate them becauſe they would have it ſo; for they give no better reaſons for it; but whether they ſeek your good or their private regard, I leave to you to determine.</p>
            <p>A Reverend Gentleman at <hi>Northwich</hi> was pleaſed to tell you, that you muſt not chuſe the ſame Members again, for if you did, the King and parliament would not agree. I wonder how long he hath been one of the King's Cabinet Council, that he can tell ſo well before; if we may believe the greateſt Miniſters, they ſay otherwiſe, and that the King out of his gracious diſpoſition to his people will deny himſelf in that which is moſt dear, rather than break with his people, ſo that either he or they are out; and I am not convinced that he is infallible, and am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he is in the wrong, ſince I have obſerved that they are for the moſt part miſtaken, who take upon them to judge of matters when they are at ſo great a diſtance from <hi>White-Hall,</hi> though it may be remembred that this Gentleman hath an affair at <hi>London,</hi> that requires his preſence much oftner than he is pleaſed to afford it; and but that great wits are unhappy in ſhort memories, that Gentleman could not have forgot that if the Parliament had continued, one of his Cloth had been ſeverely reproved for medling with matters not belonging to his Function, I mean Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and I hear there is ſo great a number of the laſt Houſe choſen, and like to be choſen, that his fault will be remembred, which by the way, Gentlemen, is the Judgment of you in your choice of me, you doing that which the reſt of the Nation hath done, and where any change is, it is only to reject thoſe that were Penſioners, or elſe vehemently ſuſpected to be Mercenaries. But I could wiſh it were not the opinion of too many, that the way to recommend themſelves as true Sons of the Church is to Preach ſeldom, and meddle with State affairs more.</p>
            <p>I hear ſome have taken offence, becauſe at <hi>Northwich</hi> I did commend the laſt Houſe of Commons; truly, Gentlemen, I only gave it as my Opinion, and till the contrary doth appear, I muſt believe that for Riches, Integrity, Learning, Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and all things that are expedient for members of that Houſe, <hi>England</hi> never
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48501:79"/>had a better; and why the parliament was Diſſolved I know not, for they who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed it, have neither dared to own it, nor the reaſons for it. There is one thing I could not but take notice of, in the oppoſition that hath been made againſt me. If you will obſerve, they are the perſons that were moſt inveterate one againſt another in the diſpute between Sir <hi>Philip Egerton</hi> and my Couſin <hi>Cholmondley;</hi> but to oppoſe me they are united as one man. If their new-made Friendſhip be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and they have this way to do it, I am very glad I have been the occaſion of their reconciliation; but if in this matter alone they are cemented, then it doth diſcover upon what Principles they act, and they are to be blamed, and not the Gentlemen who were ſet up to oppoſe me; for I believe them both to be very worthy men, one of them is my Neighbour, and I will do him what Service I can; and for the other he ſhall find me a Gentleman if he hath occaſion to uſe me.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, I have as well as I can repeated the particular charges againſt me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I had but a ſhort time to recollect my ſelf: there remains yet a general Charge which I deſire to ſpeak to; and truly it is an heavy charge, a charge not to be born if I were guilty of it. They ſay I am an evil man as to the King and Church; I wiſh my accuſers had either ſo much power or will to ſerve the King or Church as I have; and becauſe I do not know my ſelf to be guilty as to either of them, I hold my ſelf obliged to ſay ſomething in my Vindication.</p>
            <p>I know not where I ever gave my Vote to impair the King's Prerogative; for this is my Principle, and ever hath been my Opinion, that the King's Prerogative, when rightly uſed, is for the good and Benefit of the People; and the Liberties and Properties of the People are for the ſupport of the Crown and King's Prerogative, when they are not abuſed; but this bleſſed Harmony may ſometimes be diſordered either by the influence of ſome ill Counſel about the King, who to obtain their own ends, do not care to ruin their King and Maſter; or elſe from the reſtleſs Spirits of ſome ambitious men of broken fortunes, who hope to repair them out of other mens Eſtates. But It ſeems that I and the Houſe of Commons are much to blame, becauſe by one of our Votes we forbid the People to lend Money upon the Revenue by way of anticipation: I never knew it was a Crime to paſs a Vote the Law had juſtified, for the Law will maintain every part of that Vote; and therefore I need ſay no more of it, and beſides this is not a place to argue it in. As for my part i'll do my beſt to preſerve the King's Prerogative, and the way to do it is neither to add nor to diminiſh; for to make a King abſolute is not to ſupport but pull down his prerogative, for the King holds his Prerogative by the Law, and if that be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd, the Title is to be diſputed by the Sword, and he that hath the ſharpeſt will prove to have the beſt right. As to the Church I am for it as it is now Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed under Epiſcopacy, but I would have them to be ſuch as St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Tim.</hi> in his firſt Book and 3 <hi>chap.</hi> deſcribes, and when they live accordingly, I have as great a reverence for them as any man, but when they live otherwiſe they prove to be—and a ruin of the Church, and ought to be abhorr'd of all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. And for Ceremonies I take them not to be neceſſary to Salvation, but for decency and order ſake, and I conceive, this Ceremony is ſo much the more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, as it tends to the more effectual uniting of proteſtants, and to preſerve Peace and concord in the Church: I am of opinion the Church is in danger, and I'll do my beſt to ſupport it, and as the caſe ſtands we muſt either bring in Proteſtants or Papiſts; I am for bringing in Proteſtants, and that is my Crime; but you are pleaſed to judge me to be in the right. Now I will no longer doubt of my opinion, I am ſure he that is againſt bringing in Proteſtants is for bringing in Papiſts; and whether it be more profitable to ſupport the Church by uniting of thoſe who dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in Ceremonies, or thoſe who differ in Fundamentals, I think is very plain. Is he a wiſe man who if his houſe be falling, by reaſon of too much weight upon the roof, will lay more upon it, rather than propt it up and take off ſome of the weight? So they who take the Church to conſiſt of Ceremonies, muſt pardon me that I am not of their opinion, ſince the word of God warrants no ſuch thing, and my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon tells me that they are too much intereſted in the cauſe to be fit judges: for with them he is accounted a good Son of the Church, who keeps a great ſtir about Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, though he live never ſo ill a life, and perhaps is drunk when he performs his Devotion: but if a man ſeem to be indifferent as to Ceremonies, and make
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48501:80"/>them no more than indeed they be, yet in Practice Conforms more than he that makes a great noiſe about them, though he live never ſo godly a life, and as near as he can to the rule of God's word, yet he is a Fanatick and an enemy to the Church; but God Almighty tells us he will have mercy and not Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen They who accuſe me for an enemy to the King and Church have left you out of the ſtory; but I hope I ſhall not forget you, but remember on whoſe errand I am ſent; and as I have hitherto ſtuck to your intereſt, I hope nothing will draw me aſide from it, and if I know my own heart, I am perſwaded that neither rewards, threats, hopes nor fears will prevail upon me. I deſire nothing but to promote God's glory and the intereſt of the King and people, and if it ſhall pleaſe God to let me ſee the Proteſtant Religion and Government eſtabliſhed, I ſhall think I have lived long enough, and I ſhall be willing at that inſtant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign my breath. Gentlemen, I thought good to ſay this to you, and I thank you for your patience, and hope I ſhall ſo behave my ſelf in your Service, that I ſhall make it appear I am ſenſible of the honour you have done me.</p>

            <p>Therefore to the honour of the holy and undivided Trinity, the preſervation of Catholick truth in the Church: and that the King's Majeſty may be ſecur'd from the attempts of open and bloudy enemies, and the machinations of Traiterous Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Schiſmaticks: We the Vice Chancellor, Doctors, Proctors, and Maſters Regent and not Regent, met in Convocation in the accuſtom'd manner, time and place, on Saturday the 21 of July in the Year 1683. concerning certain Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons contained in divers Books and Writings publiſhed in Engliſh, and alſo in the Latin tongue, repugnant to the holy Scriptures, Decrees of Councils, Writings of the Fathers, the Faith and Profeſſion of the Primitive Church: and alſo deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of the Kingly Government, the ſafety of his Majeſty's Perſon, the Publick Peace, the Laws of Nature, and bonds of humane Society: By our Unanimous aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and conſent have Decreed and Determin'd in manner and form following:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Propoſition</hi> 1. All Civil Authority is derived originally from the People.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a mutual compact, tacit or expreſs, between a Prince and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and that if he perform not his duty, they are diſcharg'd from theirs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That if lawful Governors become Tyrants, or govern otherwiſe than by the Laws of God and Man they ought to do, they forfeit the Right they had unto their Government.</p>

            <p n="12">12. The Foundation of Civil Authority is this natural right, which is not given, but left to the Supreme Magiſtrate upon Men's entring into Societies, and not only a Foreign Invader, but a Domeſtick Rebel, puts himſelf again into a ſtate of nature, to be proceeded againſt, not as a Subject but an Enemy: And conſequently acquires by his Rebellion the ſame right over the Life of his Prince, as the Prince for the moſt heinous Crimes has over the Life of his own Subjects.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Every Man, after his entring into a Society, retains a right of defending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt Force, and cannot transfer that right to the Common-wealth, when he conſents to that Union whereby a Common-wealth is made; and in caſe a great many Men together have already reſiſted the Common-wealth, for which every one of them expecteth Death, they have liberty then to joyn together to aſſiſt and defend one another. Their bearing of Arms ſubſequent to the firſt breach of their Duty, though it be to maintain what they have done, is no new unjuſt act; and if it be only to defend their Perſons, is not unjuſt at all.</p>
            <p n="14">14. An Oath ſuperadds no obligation to pact, and a pact obliges no further than it is credited: And, conſequently, if a Prince gives any Indication that he does not believe the Promiſes of Fealty and Allegiance, made by any of his Subjects, they
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48501:82"/>are thereby freed from their ſubjection; and, notwithſtanding their Pacts and Oaths, may lawfully rebel againſt, and deſtroy their Sovereign.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THE Caſe of the late Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> which, even before the Proceſs led againſt him, you was earneſt to know, was at firſt, I thought, ſo plain, that I needed not, and grew afterwards ſo exceedingly myſterious, that I could not, for ſome time, give you ſo perfect an account of it, as I wiſhed: But this time being ſtill no leſs proper, the exactneſs of my Narrative will, I hope, excuſe all delays.</p>
            <p>The deſign againſt him being now ſo clear, and the grounds founded on ſo ſlender, that to ſatisfie all unbyaſs'd Perſons of his Integrity, there needs no more, but barely to repreſent matter of Fact; I ſhould think ſhame to ſpend ſo many words, either on argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or relation, were it not leſt to ſtrangers ſome myſtery might ſtill be ſuſpected to remain concealed: And therefore to make plain what they can hardly believe, though we we clearly ſee it.</p>
            <p>At His Royal Highneſs arrival in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Earl was one of the firſt to wait upon him, and until the meeting of our laſt Parliament, the World believed, the Earl was as much in his Highneſs favour, as any intruſted in His Majeſties affairs, in this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>When it was reſolved, and His Majeſty moved to call the Parliament, the Earl was in the Country, and at the opening of it, he appeared as forward as any in His Majeſties, and his Highneſs ſervice, but it had not ſat many days when a change was noticed in his Highneſs, and the Earl obſerved to decline in his Highneſs favour.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the Parliament, the Earl was appointed one of the <hi>Lords of the Articles,</hi> to prepare matters for the Parliament, and named by his Highneſs to be one of a <hi>Committee of the Articles</hi> for Religion, which, by the cuſtom of all <hi>Scots</hi> Parliaments, and His Majeſties inſtructions to his Commiſſioner, at this time, was the firſt thing treated of: In this Committee there was an Act prepared for ſecuring the Proteſtant Religion; which Act did ratifie the Act approving the <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> and alſo the Act contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Coronation Oath,</hi> appointed by ſeveral ſtanding Acts of Parliament, to be taken by all our Kings, and Regents, before their entry to the exerciſe of the Government.</p>
            <p>This Act was drawn ſomewhat leſs binding upon the Succeſſor, as to his own profeſſion, but full as ſtrictly tying him to maintain the Proteſtant Religion, in the publick profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof, and to put the Laws concerning it in execution, and alſo appointing a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Teſt, beſide the former, to exclude Papiſts from places of publick truſt; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the fines of ſuch as ſhould act, without taking the <hi>Test,</hi> appeared no better then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, if falling in the hands of a Popiſh Succeſſor, and <hi>ſome</hi> accounting any limitation worſe than an excluſion, and all being content to put no limitation on the Crown, ſo it might conſiſt with the ſafety, and ſecurity of the Proteſtant Religion, it was ordained, that all ſuch fines, and forfaultures ſhould appertain the one half to the informers, and the other half ſhould be beſtowed on pious uſes, according to certain Rules expreſſed in the Act.</p>
            <p>But this Act, being no wiſe pleaſing to <hi>ſome,</hi> it was laid aſide, and the Committee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged any more to meet, and inſtead of this Act, there was brought in to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, at the ſame time, with the <hi>Act of Succeſſion,</hi> a ſhort Act, ratifying all former Acts made for the ſecurity of the Proteſtant Religion, which is the firſt of the printed Acts of this Parliament.</p>
            <p>At the paſſing of this Act, the Earl propoſed that theſe words, <hi>And all Acts against</hi> Popery, might be added, which was oppoſed by the Advocate, and ſome of the Clergy, as unneceſſary, but the motion being ſeconded by Sir <hi>George Lockhart,</hi> and the then Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of the Seſſion, now turned out, it was yielded to, and added without a Vote, and this Act being ſtill not thought ſufficient, and ſeveral Members deſiring other addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and other Acts, a promiſe was made by his Royal Highneſs, in open Parliament, that time, and opportunity ſhould be given, to bring in any other Act, which ſhould be thought neceſſary for further ſecuring the Proteſtant Religion: But though ſeveral perſons, both before and after paſſing the Act for the <hi>Teſt</hi> (here ſubjoyned) did give in memorials, and overtures, yet they were never ſuffered to be read, either in <hi>Articles, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Parliament,</hi> but in place of all, this Act for the <hi>Teſt</hi> was ſtill obtruded, and nothing
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48501:84"/>of that nature ſuffered to be heard, after once that Act paſt, though even at paſſing it the promiſe was renewed.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Teſt,</hi> it was firſt brought into the Parliament without mentioning the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith,</hi> and, after ſeveral hours debate, for adding the <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> and many other additions, and alterations, it was paſt at the firſt preſenting, albeit it was ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly preſt, by near half the Parliament, that it might be delayed till next morning, the draught being ſo much changed and interlined, that many, even of the moſt engaged in the Debate, did not ſufficiently underſtand it, and though they took notes, knew not preciſely how it ſtood. And this was indeed the Earls caſe in particular, and the cauſe why, in Voting, he did forbear either to approve, or diſapprove.</p>
            <p>His part in the debate was, that, in the entry of it, he ſaid, that he thought, as few Oaths ſhould be required as could be, and theſe as ſhort and clear as poſſible: That it was his humble opinion, that a very ſmall alteration in theſe Acts, which had been uſed theſe twenty years, might ſerve, for it was manifeſt, and he atteſted the whole Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament upon it, <hi>That the Oath of Allegiance, and Declaration,</hi> had effectually debarred all Fanaticks from getting into places of truſt, all that time: It was true ſome Papiſts had ſwallowed the Oath of Allegiance, and therefore a word or two only of addition, to guard againſt them, was all he judged neceſſary.</p>
            <p>And there after, where in the cloſe of the Act, <hi>The Kings Sons, and Brothers,</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be diſpenſed with from taking the <hi>Teſt,</hi> he oppoſed the exception, and ſaid, it was our happineſs that King and People were of one Religion, and that they were ſo by Law: That he hoped the Parliament would do nothing to looſe what was faſt, nor open a gap for the Royal Family to differ in Religion, their example was of great conſequence, one of them was as a thouſand, and would draw the more followers, if once it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the people that it were honourable, and a priviledge to be of another Religion: And therefore he wiſhed, if any exception were, it might be particular for his Royal Highneſs; but his Highneſs himſelf oppoſing this, the Earl concluded with his fear, that if this exception did paſs, it would do more hurt to the Proteſtant Religion than all the reſt of that Act, and many other Acts could do good.</p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe Acts, about Religion, were in agitation, his Highneſs told the Earl one day in private, to beware of himſelf, for the Earl of <hi>Errol,</hi> and others, were to give in a Bill to the Parliament, to get him made liable to ſome debts they pretended to be Cautioners in for his Father, and that thoſe that were moſt forward in His Majeſties ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice muſt be had a care of: The Earl <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aid, he knew there was no ground for any <hi>ſuch Bill,</hi> and he hoped neither the Earl of <hi>Errol,</hi> nor any other, ſhould have any advantage of him, upon any head relating to His Majeſties ſervice. His Highneſs told others like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, he had given the Earl good advice.</p>
            <p>But ſhortly after the above-mentioned debates, there were two <hi>Bills</hi> given into the meeting of the <hi>Articles,</hi> againſt the Earl, one by the Earl of <hi>Errol,</hi> the other by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Advocate, who alledged he did it by command, for otherwiſe he acknowledged it was without his line. The Earl of <hi>Errol</hi>'s claim was, that the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> might be declared liable to relieve him, and others, of a debt, wherein, they alledged, they ſtood bound as Cautioners, for the late Marqueſs of <hi>Argyle,</hi> the Earl's Father. To which the Earl anſwered, that he had not got his Fathers whole Eſtate, but only a part of it, and that expreſsly burdened with all the debts he was liable to pay; whereof this pretended debt was none, and that the Marqueſs of <hi>Huntly,</hi> who at that time was owing to the Marqueſs of <hi>Argyle</hi> 35000 <abbr>

               </abbr> Sterl. of yearly Rent, out of the Marqueſs of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s forfaulture, without the burden of any debt; ſo that both by Law, and Equity, the Earl could not be liable, the Marqueſs of <hi>Huntly,</hi> and not he, having got that which ſhould bear <hi>this relief,</hi> and which ſhould indeed have payed the far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the Marqueſs of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s debt, the ſame having been undertaken for <hi>Huntly</hi> by <hi>Argyle,</hi> either as Cautioner for <hi>Huntly,</hi> or to raiſe money to pay his debt: Beſides that the Earl of <hi>Errol</hi> can never make it appear, that he, or his Predeceſſors, were bound, for the Marqueſs of <hi>Argyle</hi> in the third part of the ſums, he acclaims; yet ſome were much inclined to believe <hi>Errol</hi> on his bare aſſertion.</p>
            <p>His Majeſties Advocates claim was, to take from the Earl <hi>his heritable Offices of She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff,</hi> &amp;c. eſpecially that <hi>of Juſtice-General of Argyle-Shire,</hi> the iſles, and other places, which laſt is nevertheleſs only a part of the general Juſtitiary of all <hi>Scotland,</hi> granted to his Predeceſſors, ſome hundred of years ago, for honourable, and onerous cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and conſtantly enjoyed by them until expreſsly ſurrendered, in his late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties hands, for a new Grant of the above-mentioned <hi>Juſtitiary of Argyle,</hi> &amp;c. And this <hi>new Grant</hi> was alſo confirmed by many Acts of Parliament, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly by His Majeſties Royal Father, of Bleſſed Memory, in the Parliament holden by him <hi>Anno</hi> 1633. As likewiſe by His Majeſty that now is (whom
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48501:84"/>God long preſerve) his <hi>new Gift and Charter,</hi> after ſeveral Debates before him in <hi>Anno</hi> 1663. and 1672. Which <hi>new Gifts and Charters</hi> were again ratified by a ſpecial inſtruction from His Majeſty in the Parliament 1672. So that albeit ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>late Gifts of Regality</hi> granted to the Marqueſs of <hi>Athol,</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Queensberry,</hi> and others, may be queſtioned, becauſe granted ſince the Acts of Parliament diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all <hi>ſuch Gifts</hi> in time coming, yet the Earl of <hi>Argyl's</hi> rights are good, as being both of a far different nature, and granted long before the ſaid Acts of Parliament, and in effect the Earl his rights are rather confirmed by theſe prohibitive Acts, becauſe both anterior to, and excepted from them as appears by the Act <hi>Salvo Jure</hi> 1633. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Earls rights are particularly and fully excepted in the body of the printed Act.</p>
            <p>When theſe things appeared ſo plain as not to be anſwered, It was alledged that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the forfaulture of the late Marqueſs of <hi>Argyl,</hi> his Eſtate <hi>was annexed</hi> to the Crown, and ſo could not be gifted to the Earl by His Majeſty, (wherein they ſoon diſcovered a deſign to forfault him, if any pretence could be found) But the <hi>Act of Forfaulture</hi> being read, and containing no ſuch thing, but on the contrary a clear power left to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty to diſpoſe of the whole, and the Earl telling them plainly, that theſe that were moſt active to have his Father forfaulted, were very far from deſiring his Eſtate <hi>to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed</hi> to the Crown, ſeeing it was in expectation of <hi>Gifts</hi> out of it they were ſo diligent, that pretence of the <hi>annexation</hi> was paſt from, but yet the deſign was no wiſe given over, for there was a propoſition made, and a Vote carried in the <hi>Articles,</hi> that a <hi>Committee</hi> ſhould be appointed, with Parliamentary power, to meet in the intervals of Parliament, to determine all controverſies could be moved againſt any of the Earls rights; Which was a very extraordinary device, and plainly carried by extraordinary influences.</p>
            <p>Upon this the Earl applyed to the Parliament, where this Vote was to be brought, and having informed the Members of his right, and the conſequences of ſuch a new Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, he had good hope to get the Vote ranverſed, when his Royal Highneſs on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts judged it fit to put a ſtop to it, and excuſed himſelf, Saying, It was his not being acquainted, and but lately in affairs, had made him go along with it, for he found it did plainly impugn His Majeſties prerogative, and might be of ill conſequence, and indeed it is plain enough. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> would have expoſed the Marqueſs of <hi>Huntly's</hi> gift, which proceeded on the ſame forfaulture, as well as the Earl of <hi>Argyl's,</hi> to the ſame, and far greater hazard, as ſome came to be ſenſible, when they heard all. You ſee here at what rate the Earl was purſued, and on what grounds, before his taking of the Teſt came in hand.</p>
            <p>After the Parliament was adjourned, there was a new deſign to apply to His Majeſty for a <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> of the ſame nature, for reviewing all the Earls rights, and to deprive him of his heritable Offices, and, if poſſible, to burden him with more Debts then his Eſtate was worth.</p>
            <p>Upon which, the Earl waited on his Highneſs, and informed him more particularly, offering to make it appear, by unqueſtionable rights and evidences, that his Eſtate was not ſubject to any ſuch review, as was intended, and that it might breed the Earl great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but could have no effect in Law. To which his Highneſs <hi>Anſwered,</hi> That a review could do no hurt; The Earl <hi>ſaid,</hi> If a Commiſſion for a review were granted, ſomething muſt be intended, and ſomething muſt be done, and it was very like that ſome of theſe put into ſuch a Commiſſion would be his Enemies, at leaſt ſmall Friends, and therefore intreated that if any intended to quarrel his rights, they and he and all their debates might be remitted to the <hi>Ordinary Judicatories:</hi> And indeed he had reaſon, to deſire, it might be ſo, the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Judicatories</hi> being eſtabliſhed by the ancient Laws of the Kingdom, not in order or with reſpect to particular Cauſes, and Perſons, but for the general, equal and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial adminiſtration of Juſtice to all. Whereas the granting particular <hi>Commiſſions,</hi> for Trying and Judging ſuch and ſuch Caſes, and Perſons, cannot but expoſe to the juſt contrary inconveniences, there being certainly a vaſt difference betwixt a Mans <hi>finding</hi> a Judge indifferently conſtitute, and his <hi>having</hi> one expreſly and particularly appointed, for his ſingle affair, who might poſſibly think himſelf Commiſſionate, rather to ſerve a turn, in an arbitrary way, then to adminiſter fair Juſtice: But all this prevailed not, Only <hi>his Highneſs ſaid,</hi> The Commiſſion ſhould not be expede until the Earl knew the Names of the Perſons inſert in it: Whereunto the <hi>Earl Anſwered,</hi> That there might be many Perſons, againſt whom he could make no legal exception, whom yet he might have very good reaſon to decline to be his particular Judges, and to have his rights ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the ordinary Judges, and committed to their examination, and all he might poſſibly gain <hi>by excepting</hi> would be to irritate; <hi>Adding</hi> that as to his heritable Offices, he had undoubtedly right to them, and they were rather honourable, then of advantage, that his family had them for faithful ſervices to the Crown; and becauſe they had ſerved more faithfully then their Neighbours, and been more uſeful then others, in keeping the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48501:85"/>Country in peace, from Thieves and Robbers, therefore all the <hi>broken Men</hi> and their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons,</hi> were Enemies to him, and his Family, and deſirous to have theſe Offices out of his hand, but he reſolved to do as he had always done, to put himſelf in <hi>His Majeſties will,</hi> and if His Majeſty were reſolved to have back all heritable Offices, and ſhould think fit after hearing him to have back his, His Majeſty ſhould have them, either freely or for a juſt value: For though, they rendered the Earl no free yearly Rent, as the Earl uſed them, yet he might be a ſufferer in the want of them, if the Country were left op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to Thieves and Robbers, which he hoped His Majeſty would repair. His rights (as he had ſaid in Parliament) were unqueſtionable, and often times confirmed; Yet he was willing to ſurrender them all on his knee to His Majeſty, but was not willing to have them torn from him with an affront by any other.</p>
            <p>Upon this his Highneſs was pleaſed, to allow the Earl a time, to go to the Country, to bring his Papers, and he was put in hopes no <hi>Commiſſion</hi> ſhould paſs till his return, which was indeed obſerved.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Earl did writ to the <hi>Earl of Murray,</hi> His Majeſties Secretary, that he might have leave, to wait upon His Majeſty, which His Majeſty did graciouſly and readily grant; The Earl purpoſing, at his return to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> to beg the ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his Highneſs: But he found this motion more fatal to him then he could have at firſt expected ſo innocent a deſign could prove: For it was at firſt told him, he could not have acceſs to kiſs His Majeſties hand without taking the <hi>Teſt;</hi> then it dropt out, that it was ill taken, His Majeſty was at all addreſſed to, for leave to kiſs his hand: And at length it became plain, that taking the <hi>Test</hi> would not clear the way.</p>
            <p>As the Earl was on his return to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to wait upon his Highneſs, and come the length of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> he got the news, that the late Preſident of the Seſſion, and He were both turned out of it, and at his arrival at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> ſeveral meetings of Council were appointed only to occaſion his taking of the <hi>Test:</hi> But the Earl having gone ſome miles out of Town, was not preſent. At laſt a meeting of the Council was appointed <hi>expreſly,</hi> and one of the Clerks ordered to warn the Earl particularly to be preſent; whereof the Earl being advertiſed before the Clerk came to him, he waited on his Highneſs, and had the honour of an opportunity after Supper, to ſpeak to his Royal Highneſs, in his Bed-chamber: The <hi>Earl told</hi> his Highneſs, he was now returned, to make good his word, and to ſhew thoſe <hi>Writts and Rights</hi> he had promiſed: But Sir <hi>(ſaid the Earl)</hi> I have heard by the way of alterations, and that I am turn'd out of the Seſſion: His <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſaid,</hi> it was ſo: The Earl <hi>asked</hi> what next? His <hi>Highneſs ſaid,</hi> he knew no more. The <hi>Earl ſaid,</hi> he had never ſought that, nor any place, and he knew that place was at His Majeſties diſpoſe, and it might ſoon be better filled: But <hi>ſaid the Earl,</hi> if it be to expreſs a frown, it is the firſt I have had from His Majeſty this Thirty years; I know I have Enemies, but they ſhall never make me alter my Duty, and Reſolution to ſerve His Majeſty; I have ſerved His Majeſty in Arms, and in his Judicatures, when I knew I had Enemies on my right hand, and on my left, and I will do ſo ſtill. But if any have power, to render His Majeſty or your Highneſs jealous of me, it will make my Service the more uſeleſs to both, and the leſs comfortable to my ſelf: His <hi>Highneſs ſaid,</hi> he knew no more then what he had ſaid; the <hi>Earl then ſaid,</hi> it was late, and he would wiat on his Highneſs ſome other time, about theſe matters: But the thing that at preſent preſſes <hi>(ſays the Earl)</hi> is, That I hear one of the Clerks of Council is appointed to tell me to be at the Council, to morrow, I conceive, to take the <hi>Teſt;</hi> Pray, what is the haſte? may not I, with Your Highneſſes favour, have the <hi>time allowed</hi> by the Act of Parliament? <hi>His Highneſs ſaid,</hi> No. The <hi>Earl urged it</hi> again, but in vain: And all the delay, he could obtain, was till <hi>Thurſday</hi> the Third of <hi>November,</hi> the next Council day in courſe. The <hi>Earl ſaid</hi> he was the leſs fond of the <hi>Teſt,</hi> that he found, that ſome that refuſed it were ſtill in favour, and others that had taken it turned out, as the <hi>Regiſter,</hi> at which <hi>His Highneſs only laught:</hi> But Sir, [ſaid the Earl,] how comes Your Highneſs to preſs the <hi>Teſt</hi> ſo haſtily? Sure there are ſome things in it Your Highneſs doth not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ver much like: Then <hi>ſaid His Highneſs, angerly, and in a paſſion:</hi> moſt true, that <hi>Test</hi> was brought into the Parliament, <hi>without the Confeſſion of Faith:</hi> But the late Preſident cauſed put in the <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> which makes it <hi>ſuch as no honeſt Man can take it:</hi> The <hi>Earl ſaid</hi> he had the more reaſon to adviſe: Whereby you may ſee, whether his Highneſs then thought, the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> was to be Sworn to in the <hi>Teſt,</hi> or not.</p>
            <p>After this the Earl waited ſeveral times on his Highneſs, and made new attempts for the favour of a delay, but with no ſucceſs: What paſſed in private, ſhall not be repeated except ſo far as is abſolutely neceſſary to evince the Earl his innocency, and to ſhew that in what he did he had no ill deſign, nor did, in the leaſt prevaricate, or give any offence willingly, but was ready to comply, as far as he could, with a good conſcience; It was in this interval, that the Earl ſpoke with the Biſhop of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and ſaw his
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48501:85"/>
               <hi>Vindication</hi> of the <hi>Teſt,</hi> and all the <hi>Explanations</hi> I here ſend you, only the Councils ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation was not yet thought on: And that all the Biſhop did then urge the Earl with, beyond what is in his <hi>Vindication,</hi> was to have a care of a noble Family, and to tell him, <hi>that the oppoſing the exception of the Kings Sons, and Brothers, from taking the Teſt, had fired the kiln.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the laſt upon <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> the ſecond of <hi>November,</hi> late, the Earl waited on his Highneſs, and did in the moſt humble, and eaſie expreſſions he could deviſe, decline the preſent taking of the <hi>Teſt;</hi> but if his Highneſs would needs have a preſent anſwer, <hi>he beg'd</hi> his favour, that he would accept of his refuſing it in private, which was denied again: Then, <hi>he ſaid,</hi> if his Highneſs would allow him time, to go home and conſider, he would either give ſatisfaction, or the time preſcribed by the Act of Parliament would elapſe, and ſo he would go off in courſe, and without noiſe. But this alſo <hi>his Highneſs abſolutely refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:</hi> Upon which the <hi>Earl asked,</hi> what good his appearing in Council, to refuſe there, would do? <hi>His Highneſs was pleaſed to anſwer,</hi> that he needed not appear, but to employ ſome friend to ſpeak for him; and his Highneſs himſelf named one. This the Earl yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, as the beſt of a bad choice, <hi>and ſaid,</hi> he ſhould either uſe the perſon named by his Highneſs, or ſome other Relation that were a Councellor, and in Town: And, in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with his Highneſs pleaſure, the next morning, the Earl drew a Letter, for a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to the ſame Perſon his Highneſs had named, for declaring his mind in Council; wherein he expreſt his conſtant reſolution to continue a true Proteſtant, and Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which were the true ends of the <hi>Teſt:</hi> But the Letter concluding on a delay of taking the Oath, and his Highneſs having given ſome indication, how little pleaſing that office was to him, neither that friend, nor any other would, by any means, accept of it.</p>
            <p>Upon this the Earl drew a ſecond, and ſhorter Letter, to any that ſhould that day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in Council; but after much diſcourſe, it being ſuggeſted, that an explanation would be allowed, and the ſhorter the better, the Earl firſt drew one, ſuitable to his own thoughts; and it being thought too long, did inſtantly ſhorten it, and put it into his Pocket, but withal <hi>ſaid</hi> he would not offer it, till he knew his Highneſs pleaſure, leſt his Highneſs might take it ill that any had prevailed more with him, then himſelf; and therefore the Earl did refuſe to go to the Council, or out of his Chamber, till he had his approbation. A little after a Coach was ſent for the Earl, and it was told him, in the Room without the Council-Chamber, that the Biſhop of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> had ſpoke to his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſignified to him, that the Earl was willing to take the <hi>Teſt,</hi> with an <hi>Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and that the Biſhop <hi>ſaid, it would be very kindly accepted.</hi> Theſe were the expreſs words, and then (and not till then) the Earl went into the Council, and delivered (that is pronounced) his <hi>Explanation</hi> cloſe by his Highneſs, and directly towards him; ſo loud, and audible, that ſome in the furtheſt corner of the Room acknowledged they heard it: Whereupon the Oath was adminiſtred, and the Earl took it; and his Highneſs with a well ſatisfied Countenance, and the honour of a ſmile, <hi>Commanded</hi> him to take his place: And while he ſat by his Highneſs (which was his honour to do that day) his Highneſs ſpake ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times privately to him, and always very pleaſantly.</p>
            <p>And the Earl hath ſince proteſted to his friends, that he thinks his Highneſs was, at the time, well pleaſed, though ſome others, that wiſht the Earl out of the Council, appeared ſurprized, and in ſome confuſion.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing came to be treated of in Council, after the Earl had taken his Seat, was the Councils <hi>Explanation,</hi> at that time intended, and reſolved to be allowed to the <hi>Clergy only,</hi> and no other, and withal not to be printed: To which the Earl refuſed to Vote, which was afterwards made a ground of Challenge. A little after, it being the Poſt Night, the Earl ſtept out, and went to his Lodging, and though he acknowledges, he did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to give ſome friends an account of what had paſt, yet he was ſo far from ſpreading Copies of his <hi>Explanation,</hi> at taking the Oath, that he flatly refuſed to give a kind, and diſcreet friend, then in his Chamber, a Copy of it, leſt it might go abroad: And the words being few, and publickly ſpoke, it is not ſtrange they might be, almoſt perfectly repeated, as, it's known, the Clerks pretended to do; but the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ings Advocate having paſt from the accuſation of <hi>Spreading,</hi> this is only mentioned to evidence how ſingly ſtudious the Earl was to ſatisfie his own Conſcience, and how tender of giving offence, for I can ſay truly for him, he was never heard to diſſwade any to take the <hi>Teſt,</hi> nor to diſparage it, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it paſt in an Act; only he refuſed to take it himſelf, <hi>without an Explanation,</hi> which to firetch to a Crime is beyond all example. I confeſs, he never cry'd it up as <hi>ſuper excellent,</hi> or Divine, a ſome have done that can alter their tone, and decry it as much, when ever there ſhall be occaſion.</p>
            <p>The next morning the Earl waited on his Highneſs, expecting yeſternights countenance, and indeed nothing leſs than what he met with; for beginning to ſpeak with his Highneſs in private, his <hi>Highneſs interrupted him,</hi> and ſaid he was not pleaſed with his <hi>Explanation.</hi>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:48501:86"/>The <hi>Earl ſaid,</hi> he did not preſume to give it till his Highneſs allowed him: <hi>His Highneſs acknowledged,</hi> that the Biſhop of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> had told him, that the Earl intended an Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: <hi>But (ſays his Highneſs)</hi> I thought it had been ſome ſhort one, like Earl <hi>Queensburries: The Earl anſwered</hi> that his Highneſs heard what he ſaid: <hi>His Highneſs ſaid,</hi> he did, but he was ſurprized: Then the <hi>Earl ſaid,</hi> he had ſaid the ſame thing, in private, to his Highneſs, wherewith he, at that time, appeared ſatisfied: And <hi>the Earl</hi> being about to <hi>ſay more,</hi> in his own vindication, his <hi>Highneſs interrupting</hi> him <hi>ſaid, well it is paſt with you, but it ſhall paſs ſo with no other,</hi> which words, the Earl thought, did both confirm the Councils <hi>accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> and his <hi>explanation,</hi> and ſufficiently clear him of all <hi>offence,</hi> if he had incurred any.</p>
            <p>And whatever hath been his Highneſs reſolution, or the Earls misfortune ſince, the Earl is perſwaded that his Highneſs was reſolved then to puſh the affair no further; for though ſome had ſtill the ſame animoſities, and prejudices againſt the Earl, yet hitherto they had not adventured to undertake to extract, and forge ſuch Crimes, out of his words, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they did: And it was not, till private ſuggeſtions were made, that Advocates were asked (as they were) if theſe words could be ſtretched to Treaſon; and that (when the ableſt denied) the Kings Advocate complied, and was ordered to draw the Indictment, and ſome Judges were engaged, and ſecured about it, as will appear, when ever His Majeſty thinks it his Intereſt to take an exact trial of that whole affair.</p>
            <p>The Earl did think (as I juſt now ſaid) his Highneſs ſaying, <hi>it was paſt as to him,</hi> was enough; he was reſolved to ſay no more for juſtifying himſelf, but ſeeing he is ſo hardly preſſed, and his life, and honour at the ſtake, it is hoped his Highneſs will not diſown what the Earl hath hitherto ſo reſpectfully concealed, and is now no leſs neceſſary to be ſpoke out for his vindication. And that is, that beſides that his Highneſs did allow the Earl to explain, and did hear his explanation in Council, and approve it: The Earl did twice in private, once before, and once after his Oath in Council, repeat, to his Highneſs, the ſame words, that the Treaſon is now founded on: <hi>(viz.) That the Earl meant not to bind up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to wiſh, and endeavour, in a lawful way, and in his station, any alteration, he thought to the advantage of Church and State, not repugnant to the Proteſtant Religion, and his Loyalty;</hi> and that his Highneſs was ſo far from charging them with Treaſon, that <hi>he ſaid,</hi> plainly, both times, <hi>the Earls ſcruples were unneceſſary, and that the Teſt did not bind him up as he imagined; adding further, the laſt time, that the Earl had cheated himſelf, for notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the explanation, he had taken the Teſt.</hi> To which <hi>the Earl</hi> only <hi>anſwered, that then his Highneſs ſhould be ſatisfied.</hi> Now, after all this, that Treaſon ſhould be ſo earneſtly ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, and ſo groundleſsly found, in thoſe words, is it not ſtrange beyond all example? Could it be Treaſon for the Earl to ſay, <hi>He will not bind up himſelf,</hi> where his Highneſs ſays ſo oft, and ſo plainly, <hi>It was not intended that he, or any man, ſhould be bound up?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What paſt the next day, after the Earl had taken the <hi>Teſt,</hi> and was received by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, is alſo proper for you to know. The Earl, being to take it as one of the <hi>Commiſſioners of the Treaſury,</hi> it was commonly thought that he, and the other <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> were to take it in the Exchequer; but after Ten of the Clock, about two hours after the Earl had parted from his Highneſs, one told him there was a deſign upon him, to make him ſwear once more before the Council: And accordingly, at Twelve, there was an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary <hi>Council</hi> called in the <hi>Abbey,</hi> and there it was found, That the <hi>Commiſſioners of Treaſury, as Officers of the Crown,</hi> were to take the <hi>Teſt</hi> before the Council; and it was told the Earl, that the <hi>Exchequer</hi> could not, that day, ſit without him. And to make the matter more ſolemn, it was reſolved that the Council ſhould meet that Afternoon, and that his Highneſs ſhould be preſent: So as ſoon as they were met, the Oath was tendered, and the Earl offering to take it, and ſaying only theſe words, <hi>as before,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> never heard to ſpeak in Council till then, ſtood up behind his Highneſs Chair, and with Clamour, asked <hi>what was ſaid:</hi> To whom his Highneſs was pleaſed to turn and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him; upon which <hi>Roxburgh,</hi> prepared for the purpoſe, deſired, that what the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> had ſaid, the day before, might be repeated: Which the Earl, ſeeing a deſign upon him, did at firſt decline, till he was peremptorily put to it by his Highneſs, and he being Ingenuous, and thinking no courſe more proper to prevent miſtakes of words, <hi>he ſaid</hi> he had a <hi>Note</hi> of what he had ſaid in his Pocket, which his Highneſs called for very earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and <hi>Commanded</hi> him to produce; which be done, and the Paper read, ſo ſecure was the Earl of his Innocency, that he was willing, upon the firſt motion, to ſign it: But the then new Preſident of the Seſſion, now Chancellor, and the new Regiſter, could not agree, whether it was fit, or not, the Treaſon not yet appearing, when read in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, as when they had talked of it in private; ſo the Earl was removed, and then called in, and after <hi>theſe two</hi> had whered, and adjuſted their Inventions, he was deſired poſitively to ſign the Paper he had given in. To which he anſwered, he meant well, and truly did ſee no ill in the Paper, why he might not, and if the words did pleaſe them then, as they did when they were firſt pronounced, he would do it: But, if they found the leaſt matter of

Next morning, being <hi>Saturday, November</hi> 5. The Earl waited on his Royal Highneſs, and mongſt other things, told his Highneſs, he was ſtrangely ſurpriſed, that the ſaying <hi>He could not bind up himſelf in his ſtation and in a lawful way, &amp;c.</hi> as was contained in that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, was lookt on as a Crime, ſeeing he had ſaid the ſame words to his Highneſs formerly in private, without any offence, to which <hi>His Highneſs</hi> gave no anſwer, hut held his peace which made the Earl make bold, to put him to remember his own words, and to ask him, what he had ſaid, when the Earl formerly ſpoke to him: Then <hi>His Highneſs</hi> was pleaſed <hi>to ſay,</hi> he had forgot what he had ſaid: To which the <hi>Earl anſwered, the worſe indeed for me;</hi> But Sir, here are the ſame words, I formerly ſaid, without offence, what ſays Your Highneſs now? What ill is in them? Let me know and I will vindicate my ſelf. And all his Highneſs at this Second time <hi>ſaid,</hi> was, what hath been above remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>That they were unneceſſary words, that the Earl ſcrupled needleſly, that he was not tyed up by that Oath, as he imagined;</hi> And after a pauſe added, <hi>As I have already told you, Well, you have cheated your ſelf, you have taken the Test:</hi> To which the Earl replyed, he hoped then his Highneſs was ſatisfied, (as above) his Highneſs then <hi>began to complain,</hi> that the Earl, the little while he ſat in Council, after he had taken the Oath, had not gone along to approve the Councils explanation: <hi>The Earl ſaid</hi> he had not heard the debate: And therefore, it was reaſonable, to excuſe him from Voting. <hi>His Highneſs returned,</hi> a little warmly, that the Earl knew the Caſe well enough (which indeed was not unlike, and yet not at all ſtrange, that the Earl could not Vote, for that explanation, ſeeing he could not but know, the Parliament did intend <hi>the Confeſſion</hi> ſhould be Sworn: And that he himſelf had taken it in that ſenſe, as all others had done, before that explanation paſt in Council) but the Earl replying nothing, his Highneſs <hi>continued, That the Earl, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bad deſigned to bring trouble upon an handful of poor Catholicks, that would live peaceably, however they were uſed, but it ſhould light upon others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A little after, <hi>His Highneſs commanded</hi> the Earl not to go out of Town, till he waited on him, which the Earl ſaid he ſhould obey: But notwithſtanding thereof, one of the Clerks of the Council was ſent to the Earl, that ſame night, late, to intimate to him, not to go out of Town, till the Council ſhould ſit, upon the <hi>Tueſday</hi> thereafter.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Monday,</hi> the Seventh of <hi>November,</hi> the Earl waited on His Highneſs again, and told him, he was ſurpriſed to get ſuch a meſſage from the Council, after His Highneſs had laid his own Commands upon him, and asked what the Councils meaning could be: His Highneſs was pleaſed to ſay, he knew nothing, but referred all to themſelves, at their meeting.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Tueſday,</hi> the Eight of <hi>November,</hi> when the Council met, without ever calling the Earl, an Order was ſent to him, by one of their Clerks, to enter himſelf Priſoner in the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> before Twelve of the Clock the next day, with a warrant to the <hi>Deputy Governour,</hi> to keep him Priſoner, wherein the word <hi>Sure-firmance</hi> was ſtruck out, which appeared to have been fairly writ: This Order the Earl received, and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, with great ſubmiſſion, entering all alone in an Hackney-Coach: And when ſome of his Relations, and Perſons of quality, offered to go along with him, he refuſed, <hi>ſaying,</hi> that if he were purſued at the inſtance of any other, he would accept of their civility but ſeeing he was purſued, at the inſtance of His Majeſties Advocate, he would go, in the moſt humble way that he could think on, and have no body concerned but himſelf.</p>
            <p>But all this did not hinder the Council, to write to his Majeſty the Letter hereafter inſert, giving Judgment, before Tryal, without any hearing, and ſeeking leave to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to a proceſs, which they likewiſe proceeded in, before any return came, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, about the very Date of this Letter, they emitted their explanation of the <hi>Teſt:</hi> Albeit in their Letter, they aſſert, <hi>That they had been very careful not to ſuffer any to take the</hi> Teſt <hi>with gloſſes and explanations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Earl, ſome days after his entering Priſoner into the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> did write a Letter to his Royal Highneſs, <hi>telling him,</hi> that he had obeyed his Highneſs, and the Councils Order, in entering Priſoner in that place, that he had not written ſooner, leaſt he might be thought too impatient of his puniſhment, which appeared to be the effects of an high diſpleaſure, which, he hoped, he no wiſe deſerved; that he
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48501:87"/>was reſolved to continue in all duty, and obedience to His Majeſty, and his Royal Highneſs, and never to fail in any profeſſion thereof he had made; and begged to know what ſatisfaction was expected, and where, and how, he might live with his Highneſs favour.</p>
            <p>This Letter, at Firſt, ſeemed to pleaſe, and, the <hi>Earl heard,</hi> it did, but the only anſwer, directly returned, was <hi>Summonds</hi> charging the Earl, <hi>with leaſing making, and depraving of Laws,</hi> before any return from His Majeſty: And after a <hi>return</hi> came, another <hi>Summonds,</hi> with ſound of Trumpet, containing <hi>Perjury and Treaſon,</hi> added to the former crimes: Notwithſtanding all which, fair weather was made, and it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out, and likewiſe intimated to the Earl, by a particular meſſage from one of the <hi>Club,</hi> that no more was deſigned, but to humble the Earl, and to take his heritable and other Offices from him, and his Family, and when his Highneſs was told <hi>it was hard meaſure,</hi> by ſuch a proceſs, and on ſuch pretenſions, to threaten <hi>Life, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;</hi> his Highneſs ſaid, <hi>Life, and Fortune? God forbid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What happened after theſe things, and how the proceſs was carried on, follows now in order: And for your more clear, and diſtinct information, I have ſent you, ſeveral very neceſſary and uſeful <hi>Papers,</hi> with <hi>Indexes</hi> on the Margin, pointing at ſuch Paſſages, as more remarkably concern this affair</p>

               </head>
               <p>I <hi>Have conſidered the</hi> Teſt, <hi>and I am very deſirous to give obedience as far as I can. I'm confident the Parliament never intended to impoſe contradictory Oaths: Therefore I think no Man can explain it but for himſelf. Accordingly I take it, as far as it is conſiſtent with it ſelf and the Protestant Religion. And I do declare, That I mean not to bind up my ſelf in my ſtation and in a lawful way, to wiſh and endeavour any alteration I think to the advantage of Church or State, not repugnant to the Proteſtant Religion and my Loyalty. And this I understand as a part of my Oath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Earl finding, as hath been narrated, this his Explication though accepted, and approven by his Highneſs and Council the day before, to be this day carped and offended at, and advantages thereupon ſoughtand deſigned againſt him, did immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately draw up the following Explanation of his Explication, and for his own vindication did firſt communicate it to ſome privately, and thereafter intended to have offered it at his Trial for clearing of his defences.</p>

               <head>The Explanation of his Explication.</head>
               <p>I <hi>Have delayed hitherto to take the Oath, appointed by the Parliament to be taken, by the first of</hi> January <hi>next: But now being required, near two Months ſooner, to take it, this day peremptorily, or to refuſe.</hi> I have conſidered the <hi>Test, and have ſeen ſeveral Objections moved againſt it, eſpecially by many of the Orthodox Clergy, notwithstand whereof, I have endeavoured to ſatisfie my ſelf with a just Explanation, which I here offer, that I may both ſatisfie my conſcience, and obey Your Highneſs, and Your Lordſhips commands in taking the</hi> Teſt; <hi>though the Act of Parliament do not ſimply command the thing, but only under a Certification which I could eaſily ſubmit to, if it were with Your Highneſs favour, and might be without offence, but I love not to be ſingular,</hi> and I am very deſirous to give obedience <hi>in this and every thing,</hi> as far as I can, <hi>and that which clears me is, that</hi> I am confident <hi>what ever any Man may think, or ſay, to the prejudice of this Oath,</hi> the Parliament never intended to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe contradictory Oaths; <hi>and becauſe their ſenſe, (they being the framers and impoſers) is the true ſenſe, and that this</hi> Teſt <hi>injoyned is of no private interpretation, nor are the Kings Statutes to be interpreted but as they bear, and to the intent they are made,</hi> Therefore I think no Man, <hi>that is, no private Perſon,</hi> can explain it <hi>for another, to amuſe or trouble him with (it may be) miſtaken gloſſes: But every Man, as he is to take it, ſo is to explain it</hi> for himſelf, <hi>and to endeavour to underſtand it, (notwithſtanding all theſe exceptions) in the Parliament, which is its true and genuine ſenſe,</hi> I take it therefore <hi>notwithstanding any ſcruple made by any</hi> as far as it is conſiſtant with it ſelf, and the Proteſtant Religion <hi>which is wholly in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments ſenſe, and their true meaning; which [being preſent] I am ſure, was owned by all to be the ſecuring of the Proteſtant Religion, founded on the Word of God, and contained in the</hi> Confeſſion of Faith <hi>Recorded J.</hi> 6 <hi>p.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4. And <hi>not out of ſcruple as if any thing in the</hi> Teſt <hi>did import the contrary, but to clear my ſelf from all cavils; as if thereby I were hand up further then the true meaning of the Oath.</hi> I do declare <hi>that by that part of the</hi> Teſt, <hi>that there lies no obligation on me,</hi> &amp;c. I mean not to bind up my ſelf, in my ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in a lawful way, <hi>ſtill diſclaiming all unlawful endeavours,</hi> to wiſh, and endeavour any alteration I think, <hi>according to my conſcience,</hi> to the advantage of Church, or State, not repugnant to the Proteſtant Religion, and my Loyalty; <hi>and by my Loyalty, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand no other thing then the words plainly bear, to wit the duty and allegiance of all Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> and this <hi>explanation</hi> I underſtand as a part <hi>not of the</hi> Teſt <hi>or Act of Parliament, but as a qualifying part</hi> of my Oath <hi>that I am to Swear, and with it I am willing to take the</hi> Teſt, <hi>

And that it is much more Treaſon in any of His Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, to preſume to alter Laws already made, or to make new Laws, or to add any part to any Law by their own Authority, that being to aſſume the Legiſlative Power to themſelves, with His Majeſties higheſt, and moſt incommunicable Prerogative. Yet true it is, that albeit His Sacred Majeſty did not only beſtow on you the ſaid <hi>Archibald</hi> Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> thoſe vaſt Lands, Juriſdictions and Superiorities, juſtly forfaulted to His Majeſty by the Crimes of your decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Father, preferring your Family to thoſe who had ſerved His Majeſty againſt it, in the late Rebellion, but alſo pardoned and remitted to you the Crimes of Leaſing-making, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtruing His Majeſties and his Parliaments proceedings againſt the very Laws above-writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, whereof you were found guilty, and condemned to die therefore, by the High Court of Parliament, the 25th of <hi>August,</hi> 1662. and raiſed you to the Title and Dignity of an Earl, and being a Member of all His Majeſties Judicatures. Notwithſtanding of all theſe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other favours, you the ſaid <hi>Archibald</hi> Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> being put by the Lords of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Privy-Council to take the <hi>Teſt,</hi> appointed by the Act of the laſt Parliament, to be taken by all perſons in publick Truſt, you, inſtead of taking the ſaid <hi>Teſt,</hi> and ſwearing the ſame in the plain genuine ſenſe and meaning of the words, without any equivocation, mental re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, or evaſion whatſoever, you did declare againſt, and defame the ſaid Act; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, to the end you might corrupt others by your pernicious ſenſe, drawn the ſame in a Libel, of which Libel you diſperſed, and gave abroad Copies, whereby ill impreſſions were given of the King and Parliaments proceedings, at a time eſpecially when His Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were expecting what ſubmiſſion ſhould be given to the ſaid <hi>Teſt;</hi> and being deſired the next day to take the ſame, as one of the Commiſſioners of His Majeſties Treaſury, you did give into the Lords of His Majeſties Privy-Council, and owned twice, in plain judgment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, the ſaid defamatory Libel againſt the ſaid <hi>Teſt</hi> and Act of Parliament, declaring, That you <hi>had conſidered the ſaid</hi> Teſt, <hi>and was deſirous to give obedience as far as you could,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you clearly inſinuated, that you was not able to give full obedience. In the ſecond Article of which Libel you declare, That you were <hi>confident the Parliament never intended to impoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48501:90"/>Oaths,</hi> thereby to abuſe the people with a belief, that the Parliament had been ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious as really and actually to have impoſed contradictory Oaths, and ſo ridiculous, as to have made an Act of Parliament (which ſhould be moſt deliberate of all humane actions) quite contrary to their own intentions; after which you ſubſumed, contrary to the nature of all Oaths, and to the Acts of Parliament above cited, <hi>that every man muſt explain it for himſelf, and take it in his own ſenſe,</hi> by which not only that excellent Law, and the Oath therein ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, which is intended to be a Fence to the Government, both of Church and State, but all other Oaths and Laws ſhall be rendered altogether uſeleſs to the Government. If every man take the Oaths impoſed by Law in his own ſenſe, then the Oath impoſed is to no purpoſe, for the Legiſlator cannot be ſure that the Oath impoſed by him will bind the takers accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the deſign and intent for which he appointed it, and the Legiſlative Power is taken from the Impoſers, and ſettled in the taker of the Oath, and ſo he is allowed to be the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator, which is not only an open and violent depraving of His Majeſties Laws and Acts of Parliament, but is likewiſe a ſettling of the Legiſlative Power on private Subjects, who are to take ſuch Oaths. In the third Article of that Paper you declare, That you <hi>take the</hi> Teſt <hi>in ſo far only as it is conſiſtent with it ſelf, and the Proteſtant Religion;</hi> by which you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly intimate to the people, That the ſaid Oath is inconſiſtent with it ſelf, and with the Proteſtant Religion, which is not only a down right depraving of the ſaid Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but is likewiſe a miſconſtruing of His Majeſties and the Parliaments proceedings, and miſrepreſenting them to the people in the higheſt degree, and in the tendereſt points they can be concerned; and implying, that the King and Parliament have done things incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Proteſtant Religion, for ſecuring of which that <hi>Test</hi> was particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. In the Fourth Article you do expreſly declare, that you <hi>mean not</hi> by taking the ſaid <hi>Test, to bind up your ſelf from wiſhing and endeavouring any alteration in a lawful way that you ſhall think fit, for advancing of Church and State;</hi> whereby alſo it was deſigned by the ſaid Act of Parliament and Oath, That no man ſhould make any alteration in the Government of Church and State, as it is now eſtabliſhed; and that it is the Duty of all good Subjects, in humble and quiet manner, to obey the preſent Government. Yet you not only declare your ſelf, but by your example you invite others to think themſelves looſed from that Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and that it is free for them to make any alteration in either, as they ſhall think fit, concluding your whole Paper with theſe words, (<hi>And this I underſtand as a part of my Oath</hi>); which is a treaſonable invaſion upon the Royal Legiſlative Power, as if it were lawful for you to make to your ſelf an Act of Parliament, ſince he who can make any part of an Act may make the whole, the Power and Authority in both being the ſame. Of the which Crimes above mentioned, you the ſaid <hi>Archibald</hi> Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> are Actor, Art and Part; which being found by the Aſſize, you ought to be puniſhed with the pains of Death, fort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>The Opinion of divers Lawyers concerning the Caſe of the Earl of</hi> Argyle.</head>
               <p>WE have conſidered the Criminal Letters, raiſed at the inſtance of His Majeſties Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate againſt the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> with the Acts of Parliament contained and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the ſame Criminal Letters, and have compared the ſame with a Paper, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, which is libelled to have been given in by the Earl to the Lords of His Majeſties Privy-Council, and owned by him, as the ſenſe and explication in which he did take the Oath impoſed by the late Act of Parliament. Which Paper is of this tenor: <hi>I have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the</hi> Teſt, <hi>and am very deſirous to give chedience as far as I can,</hi> &amp;c. And having like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe conſidered that the Earl, after he had taken the Oath, with the explication and ſenſe then put upon it, it was acquieſced to by the Lords of Privy-Council, and he allowed to take his place, and to ſit and Vote. And that, before the Earls taking of the Oath, there were ſeveral papers ſpread abroad, containing objections, and alledging inconſiſtencies and contradictions in the Oath, and ſome thereof were preſented by Synods and Presbyteries of the Orthodox Clergy, to ſome of the Biſhops of the Church. It is our humble Opinion, that ſeeing the Earls deſign and meaning in offering the ſaid Explication was allenarly for the clearing of his own Conſcience, and upon no facrious or ſeditious deſign; and that the matter and import of the ſaid paper is no contradiction of the Laws and Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it doth not at all import any of the Crimes libelled againſt him, <hi>viz.</hi> Treaſon, Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing making, depraving of His Majeſties Laws, or the Crime of Perjury, but that the gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and inferences put by the Libel upon the ſaid paper are altogether ſtrained and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, and inconſiſtent with the Earls true deſign, and the ſincerity of his meaning and intention, in making of the ſaid Explication.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 12th of <hi>December,</hi> the day of compearance aſſigned to the Earl being now come, he was brought by a guard of Souldiers from the Caſtle to the place appointed for the Trial, and the Juſtice Court being met and fenced, the Earl, now Marqueſs of <hi>Queensberry,</hi> then Juſtice-General, the Lords <hi>Nairn, Collingtoun, Forret, Newtoun</hi> and <hi>Hirkhouſe,</hi> the Lords of Juſtitiary ſitting in Judgment, and the other formalities alſo performed, the Indictment above ſet down <hi>Num.</hi> 24. was read, and the Earl ſpoke as follows.</p>

               <p>I Look upon it as the undeniable priviledge of the meaneſt Subject to explain his own words in the moſt benign ſenſe; and even when perſons are under an ill Character, the miſconſtruction of words in themſelves not ill can only reach a preſumption or aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but not any more.</p>
               <p>But it is ſtrange to alledge, as well, as I hope, impoſſible, to make any that know me believe, that I could intend any thing but what was honeſt and honourable, ſuitable to the Principles of my Religion and Loyalty, tho I did not explain my ſelf at all.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I pray you be not offended that I take up a little of your time, to tell you I have from my Youth made it my buſineſs to ſerve His Majeſty faithfully, and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, to my power, appeared in his Service; eſpecially in all times of difficulty, and have never joined, nor complied with any Intereſt or Party, contrary to His Majeſties Authority, and have all along ſerved him in his own way, without a frown from His Majeſty theſe thirty years.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as I paſſed the Schools and Colledges, I went to travel to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and was abroad 1647, 1648, and till the end of 1649.</p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:48501:93"/>
               <p>My firſt appearance in the World, was to ſerve His Majeſty as Collonel in his Foot-Guards; and tho at that time all the Commiſſions were given by the then Parliament, yet I would not ſerve without a Commiſſion from His Majeſty, which I have ſtill the Honour to have by me.</p>
               <p>After the misfortune of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> I continued in Arms for His Majeſties Service, when <hi>Scotland</hi> was over-run with the Uſurpers, and was alone with ſome of my Friends in Arms in the Year 1652. and did then keep up ſome appearance of oppoſition to them: And Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Major <hi>Dean</hi> coming to <hi>Argyleſhire,</hi> and planting ſeveral Garriſons, he no ſooner went away but we fell upon the Garriſons he had left, and in one day took two of them, and cut off a conſiderable part of a third, and carried away in all about three hundred Priſoners. And in the end of that year, I ſent Captain <hi>Shaw</hi> to His Majeſty, with my humble Opinion how the War might be carried on who returned to me with Inſtructions and Orders, which I have yet lying by me.</p>
               <p>After which, I joyned with thoſe His Majeſty did Commiſſionate, and ſtood out till the laſt, that the Earl of <hi>Middleton,</hi> His Majeſties Lieutenant General, gave me Orders to Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate, which I did without any other Engagements to the Rebels, but allowing perſons to give Bail for my living peaceably, and did at my Capitulating relieve ſeveral Priſoners by exchange, whereof my Lord <hi>Granard,</hi> out of the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> was one.</p>
               <p>It is notarly known, that I was forefaulted by the Uſurpers, who were ſo jealous of me, that contrary to their Faith, within eight months after my Capitulation, upon pretence I keep'd Horſes above the value, they ſeized on me, and keeped me in one Priſon after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till His Majeſties happy Reſtauration, and this only becauſe I would not engage not to ſerve His Majeſty, tho there was no Oath required.</p>
               <p>I do with all gratitude acknowledge His Majeſties goodneſs, bounty, and Royal favours to me, when I was purſued before the Parliament in the year 1662. His Majeſty was graciouſly pleaſed not to ſend me here in any opprobrious way, but upon a bare verbal Parole; upon which I came down Poſt, and preſented my ſelf a Fourthnight before the day. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof I was immediately clapt up in the Caſtle, but having ſatisfied His Majeſty at that time, of my entire Loyalty, I did not offer to plead by Advocates. And His Majeſty was not only pleaſed to pardon my Life, and to reſtore me to a Title and Fortune, but to put me in truſt in his Service, in the moſt eminent Judicatories of this Kingdom, and to heap favours upon me, far beyond what ever I did or can deſerve, tho I hope His Majeſty hath always found me faithful and thankful, and ready to beſtow all I have, or can have for his Service. And I hope never hath had, nor ever ſhall have ground to repent any favour he hath done me. And if I were now really guilty of the Crimes libelled, I ſhould think my ſelf a great Villain.</p>
               <p>The next occaſion I had to ſhew my particular zeal to His Majeſties Service, was in <hi>Anno</hi> 1666. when the Inſurrection was made that was repreſt at <hi>Pentland-Hills.</hi> At the very firſt, the intercourſe betwixt this place and me was ſtopt, ſo that I had neither Intelligence nor Orders from the Council, nor from the General, but upon a Letter from the now Archbiſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> telling me there was a Rebellion like to be in the three Kingdoms, and bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me beware of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Kintyre.</hi> I brought together about two thouſand men; I ſeized all the Gentlemen in <hi>Kintyre</hi> that had not taken the Declaration, tho I found them peaceable. And I ſent a Gentleman to General <hi>Dalziel,</hi> to receive his Orders, who came to him juſt as they were going to the Action at <hi>Pentland,</hi> and was with him in it, and I kept my men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether till his return. And when I met with conſiderable trouble from my Neighbours, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliouſly in Arms, and had Commiſſions both on publick, and private accounts, have I not carried dutifully to His Majeſty, and done what was commanded with a juſt moderation, which I can prove under the hands of my enemies, and by many infallible demonſtrations?</p>
               <p>Pardon me a few words: Did I not in this preſent Parliament ſhew my readineſs to ſerve His Majeſty and the Royal Family, in aſſerting vigorouſly the lineal legal Succeſſion of the Crown, and had a care to have it expreſt in the Commiſſions of the Shires and Burghs I had intereſt in? Was I not for offering proper Supplies to His Majeſty and his Succeſſor? And did I not concur to bind the Landlords for their Tenants, altho I was mainly concerned? And have I not always kept my Tenants in obedience to His Majeſty?</p>
               <p>I ſay all this, not to arrogate any thing for doing what was my Honour and Duty to His Majeſty; but if after all this, upon no other ground but words that were ſpoken in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute innocence, and without the leaſt deſign, except for clearing my own Conſcience, and that are not capable of the ill ſenſe wreſted from them by the Libel, I ſhould be further trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, what aſſurance can any of the greateſt Quality, Truſt, or Innocence, have that they are fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure? Eſpecially conſidering, that ſo many Scruples have been ſtarted, as all know, not only by many of the Orthodox Clergy, but by whole Presbyteries, Synods, and ſome Biſhops, which were thought ſo conſiderable, that an eminent Biſhop took the pains to write a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, that was read over in Council, and allowed to be Printed, and a Copy given to me, which contains all the expreſſions I am charged for, and many more that may be ſtretched to a worſe ſenſe.</p>
               <pb n="1611" facs="tcp:48501:93"/>
               <p>Have I not ſhewed my zeal to all the ends of the <hi>Teſt?</hi> How then can it be imagined that I have any <hi>ſiniſter</hi> deſign in any thing that I have ſaid? If I had done any thing contrary to it all the courſe of my life, which I hope ſhall not be found, yet one act might pretend to be excuſed by a habit. But nothing being queſtioned but the ſenſe of words miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirued to the greateſt height, and ſtretched to imaginary inſinuations, quite contrary to my ſcope and deſign, and ſo far contrary, not only to my ſenſe, but my principles, Intereſt, and duty, That I hope my Lord Advocate will think he hath gone too far on in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and ſay plainly what he knows to be truth by his acquaintance with me, both in publick and private; <hi>viz.</hi> That I am neither Papiſt nor Fanatick, but truly loyal in my principles and practices.</p>
               <p>The hearing of this Libel would trouble me beyond moſt of the ſufferings of my Life if my innocence did not ſupport me, and the hopes of being vindicated of this and other Calumnies before this publick and Noble Auditory.</p>
               <p>I leave my Defences to theſe Gentlemen that plead for me, they know my innocence, and how ground leſs that Libel is.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only ſay, As my Life hath moſt of it been ſpent in ſerving and ſuffering for his Majeſty, ſo whatever be the event of this Proceſs, I reſolve, while I breath, to be loyal and faithful to His Majeſty. And whether I live publickly or in obſcurity, my head, my heart nor my hand, ſhall never be wanting where I can be uſeful to His Majeſties Service. And while I live, and when I die, I ſhall pray, That God Almighty would bleſs His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty with a long, happy, and proſperous Reign; and that the lineal legal ſucceſſours of the Crown may continue Monarchs of all His Majeſties Dominions, and be Defenders of the True Primitive, Chriſtian, Apoſtolick, Catholick, Proteſtant Religion, while Sun and Moon endure.</p>

                  <hi>Sir</hi> George Lockhart<hi>'s Argument and Plea for the Earl of</hi> Argyle.</head>
               <p>SIR <hi>George Lockhart</hi> for the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> alledgeth, That the Libel is not Revelant, and whereupon he ought to be but to the knowledge of an Inqueſt. For,</p>
               <p>It is alledged in the general, That all Criminal Libels, whereupon any perſons Life, Eſtate, and Reputation can be drawn in queſtion, ſhould be founded upon clear, poſitive, and expreſs Acts of Parliament, and the matter of Fact, which is libelled to be the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travention of thoſe Laws, ſhould be plain, clear, and direct Contraventions of the ſame, and not argued by way of Implications and Inferences. Whereas in this Caſe, neither the Acts of Parliament, founded upon, and libelled, can be in the leaſt the foundation of this Libel: nor is the Explication which is pretended to be made by the Pannel, at the time of the taking of his Oath (if conſidered,) any Contravention of thoſe Laws; which being premiſed, and the Pannel denying the Libel, as to the whole Articles and Points therein contained, it is alledged in ſpecial,</p>
               <p>That the Libel, in ſo far as it is founded upon the 21ſt. <hi>Chap. Stat.</hi> 1. <hi>Robert</hi> 1. and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 83d. <hi>Act, Par.</hi> 6. <hi>James</hi> 5. the 43d. <hi>Act, Par.</hi> 2. <hi>James</hi> 1. and upon the 83d. <hi>Act, Par.</hi> 10. <hi>James</hi> 5. and upon 84th. <hi>Act, Par.</hi> 8. <hi>James</hi> 6. and upon the 10th. <hi>Act, Par.</hi> 10. <hi>James</hi> 6. and upon the 2d. <hi>Act, Par.</hi> 1. <hi>Seſ.</hi> 2. of His Sacred Majeſty, and inferring thereupon, That the Pannel, by the pretended Explication given in by him to the Lords of His Majeſties Privy-Council, as the ſenſe of the Oath he had taken, doth commit the Crime of Leaſing-making, and depraving His Majeſties Laws: The Inference and ſubſumption is moſt unwarrantable and the Pannel, tho any ſuch thing were acknowledged or proved, can never be found guilty of contraveening theſe Acts of Parliament. In reſpect it is evident, upon peruſal and conſideration of theſe Acts of Parliament, that they only concern the caſe of Leaſing-making tending to Sedition, and to beget Diſcord betwixt His Majeſty and His Subjects, and the diſlike of His Majeſties Government, and the reproach of the ſame. And the ſaid Laws, and Acts of Parliament were never underſtood or libelled upon, in any other Senſe. And all the former Acts of Parliament, which relate to the crime of Leaſing-making in general terms, and under the qualification foreſaid, as tending to beget diſcord betwixt his Majeſty and his Subjects, are explained and fully declared, as to what is the true meaning and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port thereof, by the 134th. <hi>Act, Par.</hi> 8. <hi>James</hi> 6. which relates to the ſame Crime of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing-making, and which is expreſly deſcribed in theſe terms, To be wicked and licentious, publick and private Speeches, and untrue Calumnies to the diſdain and contempt of His Majeſties Council and Proceedings, and to the diſhonour and prejudice of his Highneſs and his Eſtate, ſtirring up his Highneſs's Subjects to miſliking, and Sedition, and unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which being the true ſenſe and import of the Acts of Parliament made againſt Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing-makers, there is nothing can be inferred from the Pannel's alledged Explication, which can be wreſted or conſtrued to be a Contravention of theſe Laws: In reſpect,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is known by the whole tenor of his Life, and graciouſly acknowledged by His Sacred Majeſty, by a Letter under His Royal Hand, that the Pannel did ever moſt zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, vigorouſly, and faithfully promote and carry on His Majeſties Service and Intereſt, even in the worſt and moſt difficult times: Which is alſo acknowledged by a Paſs under the Earl of <hi>Middleton</hi>'s hand, who had then a ſpecial Commiſſion from His Majeſty, for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on His Majeſties Service in this Kingdom, as Lieutenant General under His Majeſty; and by a Letter under the Earl's hand, of the date<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> both which do contain high expreſſions of the Pannels Loyalty, and of the great Services he had performed for His Majeſties intereſt, and His Majeſty, as being conſcious thereof, and perfectly knowing the Pannels Loyalty, and his zeal, and faithfulneſs for his Service, did think fit to entruſt the Pannel in Offices and Capacities of the greateſt truſt of the Kingdom. And it is a juſt and rational preſumption, which all Laws makes and infers, That the words and expreſſions of perſons, who by the tenor and
<pb n="1614" facs="tcp:48501:95"/>courſe of their Lives have expreſſed their Duty and Loyalty to His Majeſties Intereſt, are ever to be interpreted and underſtood <hi>in meliorem partem.</hi> And by way of Implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Inference, to conclude and and infer crimes from the ſame, which the uſer of ſuch words and expreſſions never mean'd nor deſigned, is both unreaſonable and unjuſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the foreſaid Acts of Parliament made againſt Leaſing makers, and depravers of His Majeſties Laws, only proceed in the terms aforeſaid, where the words and ſpeeches are plain, tending to beget diſcord between the King and his Subjects, and to the reproach and diſlike of his Government, and when the ſame are ſpoke and vented in a ſubdolous, pernicious, and fraudulent manner: So they never were, nor can be underſtood to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the caſe of a perſon offering in the preſence of a publick Judicature (whereof he had the honour to be a Member) his ſincere and plain meaning and apprehenſion of what he conceived to be the true ſenſe of the Act of Parliament impoſing and enjoyning the <hi>Teſt:</hi> There being nothing more oppoſite to the Acts of Parliament made againſt Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing-making, and venting and ſpreading abroad the ſame upon ſeditious deſigns, than the foreſaid plain and open declaration of his ſenſe and apprehenſion, what was the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſaid Act of Parliament. And it is of no import to infer any crime; and much leſs any of the crimes libelled, albeit the Pannel had erred and miſtaken in his apprehenſion of the Act of Parliament. And it were a ſtrange extention of the Act of Parliament made againſt Leaſing-makers, requiring the qualifications foreſaid, and the Acts againſt depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving His Majeſties Laws, to make the Pannel, or any other perſon guilty upon the miſtakes and miſapprehenſions of the ſenſe of the Laws, wherein men may miſtake and differ very much, and even eminent Lawyers and Judges. So that the Acts of Parliament againſt Leaſing making, and depraving His Majeſties Laws, can only be underſtood in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs terms and qualifications foreſaid. Like as it neither is libelled, nor can be proven, that the Pannel, before he was called and required by the Lords of His Majeſties Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to take Oath, did ever, by word or practice, uſe any reproachful ſpeeches of the ſaid Act of Parliament, or of His Majeſties Government: But being required to take the Oath, he did humbly, with all ſubmiſſion, declare what he apprehended to be the ſenſe of the Act of the Parliament, enjoyning the <hi>Teſt,</hi> and in what ſenſe he had freedom to take the ſame.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Act of Parliament enjoyning the <hi>Teſt</hi> does not enjoyn the ſame to be taken by all perſons whatſoever, but only preſcribes it as a qualification without which perſons could not aſſume or continue to act in publick Truſt: Which being an Oath to be taken by ſo ſolemn an invocation of the Name of Almighty God, it is not only allowable by the Laws and cuſtoms of all Nations, and the Opinion of all Divines, and Caſuiſts, Popiſh or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, but alſo commended, that where a Party has any ſcrupuloſity, or unclearneſs in his conſcience, as to the matter of the Oath, that he ſhould exhibit and declare the ſenſe and meaning in which he is willing and able to take the Oath. And it is not at all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, whether the ſcruples of a mans conſcience, in the matter of an Oath, be in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves juſt or groundleſs, it being a certain <hi>maxim,</hi> both in Law and Divinity, that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientia etiam erronea ligat:</hi> And therefore tho the Pannel had thought fit, for the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and exoneration of his own conſcience, in a matter of the higheſt concern as to his peace and repoſe, to have expreſt and declared the expreſs ſenſe in which he could take the Oath, whether the ſaid ſenſe was conſiſtent with the Act of Parliament or not, yet it does not in the leaſt import any matter of reproach or reflection upon the juſtice or prudence of the Parliament in impoſing the ſaid Oath: but alenarly does evince the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſcrupuloſity of a mans conſcience, who neither did, nor ought to have taken the Oath but with an explanation that would have ſaved his conſcience to his apprehenſion. Otherwiſe he had groſly ſinned before God, even tho it was <hi>Conſcientia errans.</hi> And this is allowed and preſcribed by all Proteſtant Divines, as indiſpenſibly neceſſary, and was never thought to import any crime, and is alſo commended even by Popiſh Caſuiſts themſelves, who tho they allow, in ſome caſes, of mental reſervations and equivocations, yet the expreſs declaration of the ſenſe of the party is allowed and commended, as much more ingenious: and <hi>tutius Remedium Conſcientiae ne illaqueeter,</hi> as appears by <hi>Bellarmine de Juramento,</hi> and <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48501:95"/>in Caſes of a ſcrupulous Conſcience, an abhorrence and deteſtation of all reſerved ſenſes, and of all <hi>Amphibologies</hi> and Equivocations, which are in themſelves unlawful and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, upon that unanſwerable Reaſon, that <hi>Juramentum</hi> being the higheſt Act of Devotion and Religion, <hi>in eo requiritur maxima ſimplicitas;</hi> and that a party is obliged, who has any ſcruples of Conſcience, publickly and openly to clear and declare the ſame.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Albeit it is not controverted, but that a Legiſlator, impoſing an Oath, or any publick Authority, before whom the Oath is taken, may, after hearing of the Senſe and Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which a perſon is willing to put upon it, either reject or accept of the ſame, if it be conceived not to be conſiſtent with the genuine ſenſe of the Oath: Yet tho it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, it was never heard of, or pretended, that the offering of a ſenſe does import a Crime, but that notwithſtanding thereof, <hi>Habetur pro Recuſante,</hi> and as if he had not taken the Oath, and to be liable to the certification of Law, as if he had been a Refuſer.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Pannel having publickly, and openly declared the ſenſe in which he was free to take the Oath, it is offered to be proved that he was allowed, and did accordingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the taking of the Oath, and did thereafter take his place, and ſit and Vote, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that <hi>Sederunt</hi> of Privy Council. So as the pretended Senſe and Explication, which he did then emit and give, can import no Crime againſt him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is alſo offered to be proved, that before the Pannel was required to take the Oath, or did appear before his Royal Highneſs, and Lords of Privy-Council, to take the ſame, there were a great many Papers ſpread abroad from perſons and Miniſters of the Orthodox Clergy; and as the Pannel is informed, ſome thereof preſented to the Biſhops of the Church, in the name of Synods and Presbyteries, which did, in downright terms, charge the <hi>Teſt</hi> and Oath with alledged contradictions and inconſiſtencies. And for ſatisfaction whereof ſome of the Learned and Reverend Biſhops of the Church did write a learned and ſatisfying Anſwer, called <hi>A Vindication of the</hi> Teſt, <hi>for clearing the Scruples, Difficulties and Miſtakes that were objected againſt it.</hi> And which Vindication and Anſwer was exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and read before the Lords of His Majeſties Privy Council, and allowed to be printed, and from which the Pannel argues.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it neither is, nor can be pretended in this Libel, that the alledged Explication, wherein he did take the Oath, does propoſe the ſcruples of his Conſcience in theſe terms, which were propoſed by the Authors of theſe Objections, which do flatly and poſitively aſſert, that the Oath and <hi>Teſt</hi> do contain matters of inconſiſtency and contradiction, whereas all that is pretended in this Libel, with the moſt abſolute violence can be put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the words, is arguing Implications and Inferences, which neither the words are capable to bear, nor the ſincerity of the Earls intention and deſign, nor the courſe of his by-paſt life can poſſibly admit of. And yet none of the perſons who were the Authors of ſuch pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were ever judged or reputed Criminal or Guilty, and to be proſecuted for the odious and infamous Crimes libelled, of <hi>Treaſon, Leaſing-making, Perjury,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Pannel does alſo argue from the ſaid matter of Fact, that the alledged Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation libelled, can neither in his intention and deſign, nor in the words, infer or import any Crime againſt him, becauſe, before his being required, or appearing to take the Oath, there were ſpread abroad ſuch Scruples and Objections, by ſome of the Orthodox Clergy and others, ſo that the Earl can never in any ſenſe be conſtrued in his Explication where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he took the Oath, to have done it <hi>animo infamandi,</hi> and to declaim againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for the Scruples and Objections that were ſpread abroad by others, were a fair and rational occaſion why the Earl in any ſenſe or explication which he offered might have ſaid, that he was confident the Parliament never intended to impoſe contradictory Oaths; and this is ſo far from importing the inſinuation and inferen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> made by the Libel, that thereby the Parliament were ſo impious as to impoſe contradictory Oaths, as on the contrary, conſidering the circumſtances fore-mentioned, that there were papers ſpread abroad, inſinuating, That there were inconſiſtencies and contradictions contained therein, the ſaid expreſſion was an high Vindication of the Honour and Juſtice of the Parliament, againſt the Calumnies and Miſ-repreſentations which were caſt upon it, and was alſo a juſt Riſe for the Pannel, for the clearing and exonoration of his own Conſcience, in the various ſenſes and apprehenſions which he found were going abroad as to the ſaid <hi>Teſt,</hi> humbly to offer his ſenſe, in which he was clear and ſatisfied to take the Oath.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To the Libel, in ſo far as it is founded upon the Act of Parliament, <hi>viz. Act</hi> 130. <hi>Par.</hi> 8. <hi>James</hi> 6. declaring, That none ſhould preſume to impugn the Dignity or Authority of the three Eſtates of Parliament, or procure any Invaſion or diminution thereof, under the pain of Treaſon; as alſo in ſo far as it is pretended in the Libel, That the Pannel by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the ſenſe and explication libelled, has aſſumed the Legiſlative power, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable, and has made a Law, or a part of a Law.</p>
               <p>It is anſwered, The Libel is moſt groundleſs and irrelevant, and againſt which the Act of Parliament is opponed, which is ſo plain and evident upon the reading thereof, that it

And beſides, there is nothing more certain, than that the occaſion of the ſaid Act its being made was in relation to the Biſhops and Clergy; and there is nothing in the pretended Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that can be wreſted to import the leaſt Contravention of the ſaid Act, or to be an impugning of the three Eſtates of Parliament, or a ſeeking any innovation therein. And it is admired, with what ſhadow of Reaſon it can be pretended, that the Pannel has aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a Legiſlative power, or made a part of a Law, ſeeing all that is contained in the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Explication libelled, is only a Declaration of the Earls ſenſe in which he was ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to take the Oath, and ſo reſpected none but himſelf, and for the clearing of his own Conſcience, which juſtly indeed the Word of God calls a Law to himſelf, without any incroaching upon the Legiſlative power. And where was it ever debated, but that a man in the taking of an Oath, if as to his apprehenſions he thought any thing in it deſerved to be cleared, might declare the ſame, or that his exhibiting, at the time of the taking of the Oath, his ſenſe and explication wherein he did take it, was ever reputed or pretended to be the aſſuming of a Legiſlative power, it being the univerſal practice of all Nations to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this liberty; and which ſenſe may be either rejected or accepted, as the Legiſlator ſhall think fit, importing no more but a parties private ſenſe, for the exoneration of his own Conſcience? And as to that Member of the Libel founded upon <hi>Act</hi> 19. <hi>Par.</hi> 3. Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> it contains nothing but a Declaration of the pain of Perjury, and there is nothing in the Explication libelled, which can in the leaſt be inferred as a Contravention of the ſaid Act, in reſpect if it ſhould be proved, That the Pannel, at the time of the taking of the Oath, did take it in the words of the ſaid Explication, as his ſenſe of the Oath, it is clear that the ſenſe being declared at the time of taking the Oath, and allowed as the ſenſe wherein it was taken, the Pannel can only be underſtood to have taken it in that ſenſe. And although publick Authority may conſider whether the ſenſe given by the Pannel does ſatisfie the Law or not, yet that can import no more though it was found not to ſatisfie, but to hold the Pannel as a Refuſer of the Oath; but it is abſolutely impoſſible to infer the Crimes of perjury upon it, being as is pretended by the Libel, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>annel did only take it with the Declaration of the Senſe and Explication Libelled.</p>
               <p n="8">8. As the Explication libelled does not at all import all, or any of the Crimes contained in the ſaid Libel, ſo by the common principles of all Law, where a perſon does emit words for the clearing and exoneration of his own Conſcience, altho there were any ambiguity, or unclearneſs, or involvedneſs, in the tenor or import of the expreſſions or words, yet they are ever to be interpreted, <hi>Interpretatione benigna &amp; favorabili, according to the general Principles of Law and Reaſon.</hi> And it never was, nor can be refuſed to any perſon to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret, and put a congruous ſenſe upon his own words, eſpecially the Pannel being a perſon of eminent Quality, and who hath given great demonſtration, and undeniable evidences of his fixt and unalterable Loyalty to His Majeſties Intereſt and Service, and, at the time of emitting the ſaid Explication, was inveſted and intruſted in publick Capacities. And it is a juſt and rational interpretation and caution which <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> that judicious and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Caſuiſt, gives, <hi>Praelect.</hi> 2. That <hi>dicta &amp; facta principum, parentum, rectorum,</hi> are ever to be looked upon as <hi>benignae Interpretationis,</hi> and that <hi>Dubia ſunt interpretanda in meliorem par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</hi> And there is nothing in the Explication libelled, which, without detortion and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and in the true ſenſe and deſign of the Pannel, is not capable of this benign Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation and conſtruction, eſpecially reſpect being had to the Circumſtances wherein it was emitted and given, after a great many Objections, Scruples, and alledged Inconſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, were owned, vented and ſpread abroad, which was a riſe to the Earl for uſing the expreſſions contained in the pretended Declaration libelled.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Theſe words whereby it is pretended the Pannel declares, <hi>he was ready to give obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as far as he could,</hi> firſt, do not in the leaſt import, That the Parliament had impoſed any Oath which was in it ſelf unlawful, but only the Pannels ſcrupuloſity and unclearneſs in matter of Conſcience. And it is hoped it cannot be a Crime, becauſe all men cannot go the ſame length. And if any ſuch thing were argued, it might be argued ten times more ſtrongly from a ſimple refuſing of the Oath, as if any thing were enjoyned which were ſo hard that it is not poſſible to comply with it: And yet ſuch implications are moſt irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and inconſequential, and neither in the caſe of a ſimple and abſolute refuſing of the Oath, nor in the Caſe of an Explication of the parties ſenſe, wherein he is willing to take the Oath, is there any impeachment of the Juſtice, and prudence of the Legiſlator, who impoſeth this Oath, but ſingly a declaration of the ſcrupuloſity and weakneſs of the party, why he cannot take the Oath in other terms; and ſuch Explications have been allowed by the Laws and Cuſtoms of all Nations, and are adviſed by all Divines, of whatſoever prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, for the ſolace and ſecurity of a Mans Conſcience.</p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:48501:96"/>
               <p n="2">2. As to that point of the Explication libelled, <hi>That I am confident the Parliament never intended to impoſe contradictory Oaths;</hi> it reſpects the former anſwer, which, conſidering the plain and downright Objections that were ſpread abroad, and made againſt the Oath, as containing inconſiſtencies and contradictions, was an high Vindication of the Juſtice and prudence of the <hi>Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. As to theſe words, <hi>And therefore I think no body can explain it but for himſelf.</hi> The plain and clear meaning is nothing elſe, but that the Oath being impoſed by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, it was of no private interpretation; and that therefore every man who was to take it, behooved to take it in that ſenſe which he apprehended to be the genuine ſenſe of the Parliament: And it is impoſſible, without impugning common ſenſe, that any man could take it in any other fence, it being as impoſſible to ſee with anothers mans eyes as to ſee with his private Reaſon. And a mans own private ſenſe, and apprehenſion of the genuine ſenſe, was the only proper way wherein any man could rationally take the Oath.</p>
               <p>And as to theſe words, <hi>That he takes it as far as it is conſiſtent with it ſelf and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion.</hi> The Pannel neither intended nor expreſt more, but that he did take it as a true Proteſtant, and he hopes all men have taken it as ſuch.</p>
               <p>And as to that Clauſe, wherein the Pannel is made to declare, <hi>That he does not bind up himſelf in his Station, in a lawful way, to wiſh and endeavour any alteration he thinks to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Church or State, not repugnant to the Proteſtant Religion and his Loyalty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is anſwered, There is nothing in this expreſſion that can import the leaſt Crime, or give the leaſt umbrage for any miſtake, For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is moſt certain, it is impoſſible to elicite any ſuch thing from the Oath, but that it was the intention of the Parliament, That perſons, notwithſtanding of the Oath, might concur in their ſtations, and in a lawful way, in any Law to the advantage of Church and State. And no rational man ever did, or can take the Oath in other terms, that being contrary to his Allegiance and Duty to His Sacred Majeſty and Prince.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is nothing in the ſaid expreſſion which does touch in the leaſt point at any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the Fundamentals of Government, either in Church or State, but on the contrary, by the plain and clear words and meaning, rather for its perpetuity, ſtability and ſecurity. The expreſſion being cautioned to the utmoſt ſcrupuloſity, as that it was to be done in a lawful manner; that it was to be to the advantage of Church or State; that it was to be conſiſtent with the Proteſtant Religion, and with his Loyalty, which was no other but the Duty and Loyalty of all faithful Subjects; and which he has ſignally and eminently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed upon all occaſions. So that how ſuch an expreſſion can be drawn to import all or any of the Crimes libelled, paſſeth all Natural Underſtanding.</p>
               <p>And as to the laſt words, <hi>And this I underſtand as a part of my Oath,</hi> which is libelled to be a treaſonable Invaſion, and aſſuming of the Legiſlative power. It is anſwered, it is moſt unwarrantable; and a parties declaring the ſenſe and meaning in which he was free to take an Oath, does not at all reſpect or invade the Legiſlative power, of which the Pannel never entertained a thought, but has an abſolute abhorrence and deteſtation of ſuch practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But the plain and clear meaning is, That the ſenſe and explication was a part of his Oath, and not of the Law impoſing the Oath, theſe being as diſtant as the two Poles; and which ſenſe was taken off the Earls hands, and he accordingly was allowed to take his place at the Council-Board, and therefore repeats the former general Defences.</p>
               <p>And to convince the Lords of Juſtitiary, that there is nothing in the pretended explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion libelled which can be drawn to import any Crime, even of the loweſt ſize and degree, and that there is no expreſſion therein contained that can be detorted or wreſted to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the ſame, is evident from the learned Vindication publiſhed and ſpread abroad by an eminent Biſhop, and which was read in the face of the Privy Council, and does contain expreſſions of the ſame nature, and to the ſame import contained in the pretended Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, libelled as the ground of this Indictment libelled againſt the Pannel. And it is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively offered to be proven, That theſe terms were given in, and read, and allowed to be printed, and (without taking notice of the whole tenor of the ſaid Vindication, which the Lords of Juſtitiary are humbly deſired to peruſe, and conſider, and compare the ſame with the Explication libelled) the ſame acknowledgeth, that ſcruples had been raiſed and ſpread abroad againſt the Oath; and alſo acknowledgeth, that there were expreſſions therein that were dark and obſcure; and likewiſe takes notice, that the Confeſſion ratified <hi>Par.</hi> 1. <hi>James</hi> 6. to which the Oath relates, was haſtily made, and takes notice of that Authority that made it, and acknowledges in plain terms, that the Oath does not hinder any regular endeavour to regulate or better the Eſtabliſht Government, but only prohibits irregular endeavours and attempts to invert the ſubſtance or body of the Government; and does likewiſe explain the Act of Parliament anent His Majeſties Supremacy, that it does not reach the alteration of the external Government of the Church. And the Pannel and his Proctors are far from inſinuating in the leaſt, that there is any thing in the ſaid Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48501:97"/>but what is conſiſtent with the exemplary Loyalty, Piety and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Writer of the ſame. And tho others perhaps may differ in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate opinion, as to this interpetation of the Act of Parliament anent the Kings Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, yet it were moſt abſurd and irrational to pretend that whether the miſtake were upon the interpretation of the Writer, or the ſenſe of others, as to that point, that ſuch miſtakes or miſapprehenſions, upon either hand, ſhould import or infer againſt them the Crimes of Leaſing making, or depraving His Majeſties Laws: For if ſuch Foundations were laid, Judges and Lawyers had a dangerous employment, there being nothing more ordinary than to fall into differences and miſtakes of the ſenſe and meaning of the Laws and Acts of Parliament. But ſuch Crimes cannot be inferred, but with and under the qualifications above mentioned, of malicious and perverſe deſigns, joyned with licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, wicked and reproachful ſpeeches ſpread abroad, to move Sedition and diſlike of the Government. And the ſaid Laws were never otherwiſe interpreted, nor extended in any caſe. And therefore the Explication libelled, neither as taken complexly, nor in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral expreſſions thereof, nor in the deſign of the ingiver of the ſame, can in Law import againſt him all or any of the Crimes libelled.</p>
               <p>In like manner the Pannel conjoyns with the grounds above-mentioned the Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on iſſued forth by His Majeſties privy Council, which acknowledges and proceeds upon a Narrative, that ſcruples and jealouſies were raiſed and ſpread abroad againſt the Act of Parliament enjoyning the <hi>Teſt.</hi> For clearing and ſatisfaction whereof the ſaid Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was iſſued forth, and is ſince approved by His Sacred Majeſty.</p>

                  <hi>The Kings Advocates Argument and Plea againſt the Earl of</hi> Argyle.</head>
               <p>HIS Majeſties Advocate, for the foundation of his Debate, does repreſent, That His Majeſty, to ſecure the Government from the Rebellious Principles of the laſt Age, and the unjuſt Pretexts made uſe of in this, from Popery, and other Jealouſies; as alſo to ſecure the Proteſtant Religion, and the Crown, called a Parliament; and that the great ſecurity reſolved on by the Parliament was this excellent <hi>Teſt,</hi> in which, that the old jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Principles of the Covenant might not be renewed, wherein they ſtill ſwore to ſerve the King in their own way, the Parliament did poſitively ordain, That this Oath ſhould be taken in the plain genuine meaning of the words, without any evaſion whatſoever. Notwithſtanding whereof, the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> by this Paper, does invent a new way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by no man is at all bound to it. For how can any perſon be bound, if every man will only obey it as far as he can, and as far as he conceives it conſiſtent with the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and with it ſelf, and reſerve to himſelf, notwithſtanding thereof, to make any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration that he thinks conſiſtent with his Loyalty? And therefore His Majeſties Advocate deſires to know, to what the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> or any man elſe, can be bound by this <hi>Teſt?</hi> what the Magiſtrate can expect, or what way he can puniſh his Perjury? For if he be bound no farther than he himſelf can obey, or ſo far as this Oath is conſiſtent with the Proteſtant Religion or it ſelf, <hi>quomodo constat,</hi> to whom or what is he bound? And who can determine that? Or againſt what alteration is the Government ſecured, ſince he is Judg of his own alteration? So that that Oath, that was to be taken without any evaſion, is evaded in every ſingle word or Letter; and the Government as inſecure as before the Act was made, becauſe the taker is no farther bound than he pleaſes. From which it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, but his Interpretation deſtroys not only this Act, but all Government, ſince it takes away the ſecurity of all Government, and makes every mans Conſcience, under which Name there goes ordinarily in this Age Humour and Intereſt, to be the rule of the takers obedience. Nor can it be conceived to what purpoſe Laws but eſpecially Oaths, needed to be made, if this were allowed; or how this cannot fall under the 197th. <hi>Act, Par.</hi> 7. <hi>James</hi> 6. whereby it is ſtatuted, <hi>That no man interpret the Statutes otherwiſe than the maker underſtood.</hi> For what can be more contrary to the taking of them in the makers ſenſe, than that every man ſhould obey as far as they can, and be allowed to take them in a general ſenſe, ſo far as they are conſiſtent with themſelves, and the Proteſtant Religion, without condeſcending wherein they do not agree with the Proteſtant Religion? and that they are not bound not to make any alteration which they think good for the States? For all theſe make the rule of obedience in the taker, whereas the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law makes it to be in the maker. Or how could they be puniſhed for Perjury after this Oath? For when he were quarrelled for making alterations againſt this Oath; and ſo to be perjured, he might eaſily anſwer, That he took this Oath only in ſo far as it was conſiſtent with the Proteſtant Religion, and with a <hi>Salvo,</hi> that he might make any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that he thought conſiſtent with his Loyalty. And as to theſe Points, upon which he were to be quarrelled, he might ſay, he did not think them to be inconſiſtent with his Loyalty, think we what we pleaſed, and ſo needed not to be perjured, except he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:48501:97"/>to decide againſt himſelf, for in theſe Generals he reſerves to himſelf to be ſtill Judge. And this were indeed a fine ſecurity for any Government. And by the ſame rule that it looſes this Oath, it ſhews a way of looſing all Oaths and Obedience, and conſequently ſtrikes at the root of all Laws, as well as this; whereas to ſhun all this, not only this excellent Statute 107. has ſecured all the reſt, but this is common Reaſon: And in the opinion of all Divines, as well as Lawyers in all Nations, <hi>Verba juramenti intelliguntur ſecundum mentem &amp; intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem ejus, cui fit juramentum.</hi> Which is ſet down as the grand poſition, by <hi>Sanderſon</hi> (whom they cite) <hi>pag.</hi> 137. and is ſounded upon that Mother-Law, <hi>Leg.</hi> 10. <hi>Cui interrogatus f.f. de interrogationibus in Jure faciendis;</hi> and without which no man can have ſenſe of Government in his head, or practiſe it in any Nation. Whereas on the other hand there is no danger to any tender Conſcience, ſince there was no force upon the Earl to take the Oath, but he took it for his own advantage, and might have abſtained.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is inferred from the above-written matter of Fact, That the Earl is clearly guilty of contravention of the 10. <hi>Act, Parl.</hi> 10 <hi>James</hi> VI. whereby the Leiges are commanded not to write any purpoſe of Reproach of His Majeſties Government, or miſconſtrue his proceedings, whereby any miſliking may be raiſed betwixt his Highneſs, his Nobility, or his people. And who can read this paper, without ſeeing the King and Parliament reproached openly in it? For who can hear, that the Oath is only taken as far as it is conſiſtent with it ſelf and the Proteſtant Religion, but muſt neceſſarily conclude, that in ſeveral things it is inconſiſtent with it ſelf, and the Proteſtant Religion? For if it were not inconſiſtent with it ſelf and the Proteſtant Religion, why this Clauſe at all but it might have been ſimply taken? For the only reaſon of hindering it to be taken ſimply, was becauſe of the inconſiſtency: <hi>ergo,</hi> there behooved neceſſarily to be an inconſiſtency. And if there be any inconſiſtency with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, or any contradiction in the Oath it ſelf, can there be any thing a greater reproach on the Parliament, or a greater ground of miſlike to the people? And whereas it is pretended, That all Laws and Subſumptions ſhould be clear, and theſe are only inferences. It is anſwered, That there are ſome things which the Law can only forbid in general; and there are many inferences which are as ſtrong and natural, and reproach as ſoon, or ſooner, than the plaineſt defamations in the world do, for what is openly ſaid of reproach to the King, does not wound him ſo much as many ſeditious inſinuations have done in this Age and the laſt: So that whatever was the Earls deſign (albeit it is always conceived to be unkind to the Act, againſt which himſelf debated in Parliament) yet certainly the Law in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes is only to conſider what effect this may have amongſt the people; and therefore the Acts of Parliament, that were to guard againſt the miſconſtruing of His Majeſties Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, do not only ſpeak of what was deſigned, but where a diſliking may be cauſed, and ſo judgeth <hi>ab effectu:</hi> And, conſequentially to the ſame emergent reaſon, it makes all things tending to the raiſing of diſlike, to be puniſhable by the <hi>Act</hi> 60. <hi>Parl.</hi> 6. Q. <hi>Mary;</hi> and the 9. <hi>Act, Parl.</hi> 20. <hi>James</hi> VI. So that the Law deſigned to deter all men by theſe indefinite and comprehenſive expreſſions: And both in this and all the Laws of Leaſing-making, the Judges are to conſider what falls under theſe general and comprehenſive words. Nor could the Law be more ſpecial here, ſince the makers of Reproach and Slander are ſo various that they could not be bound up, or expreſt in any Law: But as it evidently appears, that no man can hear the words expreſt, if he believe this paper, but he muſt think the Parliament has made a very ridiculous Oath, inconſiſtent with it ſelf, and the Proteſtant Religion, the words allowing no other ſenſe, and having that natural tendency; even as if a man would ſay, I love ſuch a man only in ſo far as he is an honeſt man, he behooved certainly to conclude, that the man was not every way honeſt: So if your Lordſhips will take meaſures by other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, or your Predeceſſors, ye will clearly ſee, That they thought leſs than this a defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Government, and miſconſtruing His Majeſties proceedings. For in <hi>Balmerino</hi>'s Caſe, the Juſtices find an humble Supplication made to the King himſelf to fall under theſe Acts now cited. Albeit as that was a Supplication, ſo it contained the greateſt expreſſions of Loyalty, and offers of Life and Fortune that could be expreſt, yet becauſe it inſinuates dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That the King in the precedeing Parliament had not favoured the Proteſtant Religion, and they were ſorry he ſhould have taken Notes with his own hands of what they ſaid, which ſeems to be moſt innocent, yet he was found guilty upon thoſe ſame very Acts; And the Parliament 1661. found his Lordſhip himſelf guilty of Leaſing-making, tho he had only written a Letter to a private Friend, which requires no great care nor obſervation, (but this paper which was to be a part of his own Oath does) becauſe after he had ſpoken of the Parliament in the firſt part of this Letter, he thereafter added, <hi>That the King would know their Tricks;</hi> which words might be much more applicable to the private perſons therein deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than that the words now inſiſted on can be capable of any ſuch Interpretation. And if either Interpretations, upon pretext of exonering of Conſcience, or otherwiſe, be allowed, a man may eaſily defame as much as he pleaſes. And have we not ſeen the King moſt defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Covenants entered into upon pretence to make him great and glorious, by Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48501:98"/>made to take away his Brother and beſt Friend, upon pretence of preſerving the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, and his Sacred perſon? And did not all who rebelled againſt him in the laſt Age declare, That they thought themſelves bound in duty to obey him, but ſtill as far as that could conſiſt with their reſpect to the Proteſtant Religion, and the Laws and Liberties, which made all the reſt ineffectual? And whereas it is pretended. That by theſe words, <hi>I take the ſame in as far as it is conſistent with it ſelf and the Proteſtant Religion,</hi> nothing more is meant, but that he takes it as a true Proteſtant: His Majeſties Advocate appeals to your Lordſhips, and all the Hearers, if upon hearing this expreſſion they ſhould take it in this ſenſe, and not rather think that there is an inconſiſtency. For if that were poſſible to be the ſenſe, what need he ſay at all, <hi>As far as it is conſiſtent with it ſelf?</hi> Nor had the other part, <hi>As far as it is conſiſtent with the Proteſtant Religion,</hi> been neceſſary, for it is either conſiſtent with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, or otherwiſe they were Enemies to the Proteſtant Religion, that made it. Nor are any Lawyers or others in danger, by pleading or writing, for theſe are very different from, and may be very eaſily pleaded without defaming a Law, and an Oath, when they go to take it. But if any Lawyer ſhould ſay, in pleading or writing, That the <hi>Teſt</hi> was inconſiſtent, or, which is all one, that it were not to be taken by any man, but ſo far as it was conſiſtent with it ſelf, and the Proteſtant Religion, no doubt this would be a crime even in pleading, tho pleading has a greater allowance than deliberate ſwearing has. And as there is nothing wherein there is not ſome inconveniency, ſo the inconveniency of defaming the Government is much greater than that of any private mans hazard, who needs not err except he pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Whereas it is pretended, That before the Earl gave in this Explication, there were other Explications ſpread abroad, and Anſwers read to them in Council, and that the Council it ſelf gave an Explication. It is anſwered, That if this paper be Leaſing-making, or miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruing His Majeſties proceedings, and Treaſonable, as is contended, then a thouſand of the like offences cannot excuſe it. And when the King accuſed Noblemen, Miniſters, and others, in the year 1661. for going on in the Rebellions of that Age, firſt with the Covenanters, and then with the Uſurpers, it was found no Defence, That the Nation was over-grown with thoſe Crimes, and that they were thought to be duties in thoſe days. Yea, this were to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite men to offend in multitudes. And albeit ſometimes theſe who follow the examples of multitudes, may thereby pretend this as an excuſe to many, yet this was never a formal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt Guilt, nor was ever the chief of the Offenders favourable on that Head. And it is to be preſumed, That the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> would rather be followed by others, than that he would follow any example. But His Majeſties Advocate does abſolutely decline to debate a point that may defame a conſtant and ſtanding Act of Parliament, by leaving upon record a memory of its being oppoſed. Nor were this Relevant, except it could be ſaid, the Council had allowed ſuch Explications which reflected upon the King and the Government: For the writing an anſwer is no allowance, but a condemning: Nor can the Council allow any more than they can remit: And tho it may juſtly be denied that the Council heard even the Earls own Explanation, yet the hearing or allowing him to ſit is no Relevant Plea, becauſe they might very juſtly have taken a time to conſider how far it was fit to accuſe upon that Head. And it is both juſt and fit for the Council to take time, and by expreſs Act of Parliament, the negligence of the King, Officers does not bind them. For if this were allowed, Leading men in the Council might commit what Crimes they pleaſed in the Council, which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the King may quarrel many years after. And tho all the Council had allowed him that day, any one Officer of State might have quarrelled it the next day. As to the Opinion of <hi>Bellarmine, Sanderſon,</hi> and others, it is ever contended, that the principles of the Covenant agree very well with thoſe of the Jeſuites, and both do ſtill allow Equivocations and Evaſions. But no ſolid, Orthodox Divine ever allowed, That a man who was to ſwear without any Evaſion, ſhould ſwear ſo as he is bound to nothing, as it is contended the Earl is not, for the Reaſons repreſented. And as they ſtill recommend, That when men are not clear they might abſtain, as the Earl might have done in this caſe, ſo they ſtill conclude, That men ſhould tell in clear terms what the ſenſe is by which they are to be bound to the State: Whereas the Earl here tells only in the general, and in moſt ambigious terms, That he takes it as far as he can obey, and as far as it is conſiſtent with the Proteſtant Religion, and that he takes it in his own ſenſe, and that he is not bound by it from making alterations, but as far as he thinks it for the advantage of Church or State; which ſenſe is a thouſand times more doubtful than the <hi>Test,</hi> and is in effect nothing but what the taker pleaſes himſelf.</p>
               <p>As to the Treaſon founded on, His Majeſties Advocate founds it firſt upon the Fundamental and Common Laws of this and all Nations, whereby it is Treaſon for any man to make any alteration he ſhall think for the advantage of Church or State, which he hopes is a principle cannot be denied in the general. And whereas it is pretended, That this cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of mean alterations, and of alterations to be made in a lawful way: It is anſwered, That as the thing it ſelf is Treaſon, ſo this Treaſon is not taken off by any of theſe qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, becauſe he declares, he will wiſh and endeavour any alteration he thinks fit; and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48501:98"/>any alteration comprehends all alterations that he thinks fit: <hi>Nam propoſitio indefinita aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollet univerſali.</hi> And the word <hi>any</hi> is general in its own nature, and is in plain terms a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving to himſelf to make alterations, both great and ſmall. And the reſtriction is not, all alterations that the King ſhall think fit, or are conſiſtent with the Laws and Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but he is ſtill to be Judge of this, and his Loyalty is to be the Standard. Nor did the Covenanters in the laſt Age, nor do theſe who are daily executed, decline that they are bound to obey the King, ſimply, but only that they are bound to obey him no otherwiſe than as far as his Commands are conſiſtent with the Law of God, of Nature, and of this Kingdom, and with the Covenant: And their Treaſon lies in this. And when it is asked them, Who ſhall be judge in this, they ſtill make themſelves Judges. And the reaſon of all Treaſon being, that the Government is not ſecure, it is deſired to be known, what way the Government can be ſecured after this paper, ſince the Earl is ſtill Judge how far he is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and what is his Loyalty. And if this had been ſufficient, the Covenant had been a very excellent paper, for they are there bound to endeavour, in their ſeveral ſtations, to defend the Kings perſon; but when the King challenged them, how they came to make War againſt him, their great Refuge was, That they were themſelves ſtill Judges as to that. And for il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrating this power, the Lords of Juſtitiary are deſired to conſider, <hi>Quid Juris,</hi> if the Earl, or any man elſe, ſhould have reſerved to himſelf, in this Oath, a liberty to riſe in Arms, or to oppoſe the lineal Succeſſion, tho he had added, <hi>In a lawful manner;</hi> for the thing being in it ſelf unlawful, this is but ſham, and <hi>Proteſtatio contraria facto.</hi> And if theſe be unlawful, notwithſtanding of ſuch additions, ſo much more muſt this general reſervation, <hi>of making any alterations,</hi> likewiſe be unlawful, notwithſtanding of theſe additions. For he that reſerves the general power of making any alteration, does, <hi>a fortiori,</hi> reſerve power to make any alteration tho never ſo fundamental. For all particulars are included in the General; and whatever may be ſaid againſt the particulars, may much more ſtrongly be ſaid againſt the general.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The 130. <hi>Act, Par.</hi> 8. <hi>James</hi> VI, is expreſsly founded on becauſe nothing can be a greater diminution of the power of the Parliament, than to introduce a way or means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all their Acts and Oaths ſhall be made inſignificant and ineffectual, as this paper does make them, for the Reaſons repreſented. Nor are any of the Eſtates of Parliament ſecure at this rate, but that they who reſerved a general power to make all alterations, may, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eneral, come to alter any of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What can be a greater impugning of the Dignity and Authority of Parliaments, than to ſay, That the Parliament has made Acts for the ſecurity of the Kingdom, which are in themſelves ridiculous, inconſiſtent with themſelves and the Proteſtant Religion?</p>
               <p>And as to what is anſwered againſt invading the Kings Prerogative, and the Legiſlative power in Parliaments, in adding a part to an Oath or Act, is not relevantly inferred, ſince the ſenſe of theſe words, <hi>And this I underſtand as a part of my Oath,</hi> is not to be underſtood as if any thing were to be added to the Law, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ly to the Oath, and to be an interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Oath. It is replied, That after this, no man needs to add a Caution to the Oath in Parliament. But when he comes to take the Oath, do the Parliament what they pleaſe, he will add his own part. Nor can this part be looked upon as a ſenſe, for if this were the ſenſe before this paper, he needed not underſtand it as a part of it, for it wanted not that part. And in general, as every man may add his own part, ſo the King can be ſecure of no part. But your Lordſhips of Juſtitiary are deſired to conſider, how dangerous it would be in this Kingdom, and how ill it would ſound in any other Kingdom, That men ſhould be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reſerve to themſelves liberty to make any alteration they thought fit in Church or State, as to the legality of which, they were themſelves to be Judges; and how far, from degree to degree, this at laſt may come to abſolute Anarchy, and how ſcandalous a thing, as well as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecure, this new way may look in an Age wherein we are too much tracing the ſteps of our rebellious Progenitors in the laſt, whoſe great defection and error was, That they thought themſelves, and not the King, the Authors of Reformation in Church and State. And no man ever was barred by that, that the way he was upon was not a lawful way; for if it be allowed to every man to take his own way, every man will think his own way to be the lawful way.</p>
               <p>As to the Perjury, it is founded on this, Firſt, That Perjury may be committed, not only by breaking an Oath, but even in the ſwearing of it, <hi>viz.</hi> To ſwear it with ſuch Evaſions as make the Oath ineffectual; for which <hi>Sanderſon</hi> is cited, <hi>pag.</hi> 138. <hi>Alterum Perjurii genus est novo aliquo excogitato Commento Juramenti vim declinare, aut eludere, &amp; Jurans tenetur ſub p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And it is undeniable, that he has not ſworn in the ſenſe of the makers of the Law, but in his own ſenſe, which is Perjury, as is ſaid. And conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, whatever ſenſe may be allowed in ambiguous Caſes, yet there can be none where the

                  <hi>Sir</hi> John Dalrymple's <hi>Defence and Plea for the Earl of</hi> Argyle, <hi>by way of Reply upon the King's Advocate.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>SIR <hi>John Dalrymple</hi> replies for the Pannel, That ſince the ſolid grounds of Law ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the Defences have received no particular Anſwers, in relation to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent of all Caſuiſts, <hi>viz.</hi> That a party who takes an Oath is bound in Conſcience to clear and propoſe the terms and ſenſe in which he does underſtand the Oath; Nor in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the ſeveral Grounds adduced concerning the legal and rational Interpretation of dubious Clauſes. And ſince theſe have received no Anſwers, the Grounds are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated: but the Proctors for the Pannel do farther inſiſt on theſe Defences.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not alledged, That any Explanation was given in by the Pannel to any perſon, or any Copy ſpread, before the Pannel did take the <hi>Teſt</hi> in Council: So that it cannot be pretended, That the many Scruples that have been moved concerning the <hi>Teſt,</hi> did ariſe from the Pannel's Explication: But on the contrary, all the Objections that are anſwered, and obviated in the Pannel's Explication, were not only privately muttered, or were the thoughts of ſingle or illiterate perſons, but they were the difficulties propoſed by Synods and Presbyteries, long before the Pannel came from home, or was required to take the <hi>Teſt:</hi> So that the general terms of the Acts of Parliament founded upon in the Libel are not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to this Caſe: For as theſe Laws, in relation to Leaſing-makers, are only relative to atrocious wilful Inſinuations, or miſconſtructions of His Majeſties Perſon or Government, or the open depraving of his Laws, ſo the reſtrictive Cauſe, <hi>whereby ſedition or miſconſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be moved, raiſed, or engendered betwixt His Majeſty and his Liedges,</hi> cannot be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to this Caſe, where all theſe Apprehenſions and Scruples were on foot, and agitated long before the Pannel's Explanation.</p>
               <p>As it cannot be pretended, That any new duſt was raiſed by the Pannel's Explanation, ſo it is poſitively offered to be proved, That there is not one word contained in this Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but that either theſe individual words, or much worſe, had been publickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and <hi>verbatim</hi> read in Council, without the leaſt diſcouragement, or the leaſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection made by any Member of the Council. And where a Writing, <hi>ex propoſito</hi> read in ſo high a Court, was univerſally agreed upon, without the alteration of a Syllable, how can it be pretended, That any perſon thereafter uſing the ſaid individual terms in any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation, and far eaſier terms, that they ſhall incur the high and infamous Crimes libelled? And the queſtion is not here, Whether the Council was a proper Judicature to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, or impoſed a ſenſe, or allowed any Explanation of the <hi>Test</hi> to be publiſhed; but that it is impoſſible that a ſenſe they allowed, or being publickly read before them, and which the Kings Advocate did not controul, that this ſhould import Treaſon, or any Crime: And tho the Pannels Advocate will not purſue or follow the Reply that has been made to this point, yet certainly no man of ſober ſenſe will think that it is fit to inſinuate that ſo high a Judicature might have authoriſed or acquieſced in ſuch Explanations as the Liedges thereafter ſhould be entrapped to have uſed.</p>
               <p>If the Pannel had officiouſly or ulteroneouſly offered a ſenſe or Explanation of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Laws, which the Laws themſelves could not have born, it might juſtly have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that he was <hi>extra ordinem,</hi> and medling in a matter he was not concerned in, but where the Act of Council did enjoyn, and he was required and cited to that effect, It could neither be conſtructed as oſtentation, or to move or encourage Scruples or Reſiſtance, but it was abſolutely neceſſary, either for to have refuſed the <hi>Teſt,</hi> or elſe to have declared what he thought to be the true and genuine meaning of it. And there being ſo many objections publickly moved and known, his Explanation was nothing elſe but to clear, That he did not look upon theſe Scruples and Objections moved by others as well ſounded and rational in themſelves; and therefore he was able to take the <hi>Teſt</hi> in that ſenſe the Council had heard or allowed. And it is not controverted, that the ſenſe of the Legiſlator is the genuine ſenſe both of Laws and Oaths: And if a perſon were only interpreting the meaning of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Law or an Oath impoſed, he ſhould deprave and miſconſtruct the Law and Oath, if he rendred it wittingly and willingly in terms inconſiſtent with the meaning of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer: But there is a great difference betwixt taking of Oaths, and interpreting Oaths; For when a man comes to take an Oath, except his particular ſenſe did agree with the genuine meaning of the impoſer, he cannot take that Oath, tho he may very well inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48501:99"/>and declare what is the ſenſe of the Legiſlator, which he may know, and yet perhaps not be able to take the Oath.</p>
               <p>And therefore when there is any doubtfulneſs in an Oath, and a party is bound to take it, if then he gives in an Explication of the ſenſe which in his private judgment doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend to be the genuine meaning, if that private ſenſe be diſconform to the Legiſlators ſenſe in the Oath, then the Impoſer of the Oath, or he that has power to offer it to the party, if he conſider the parties ſenſe diſconform, he ought to reject the Oath, as not fulfilling the intent of the Law impoſing it.</p>
               <p>But it is impoſſible to ſtate that as a Crime, That a party ſhould neither believe what is propoſed in the Oath, nor be able to take it; And he can run no farther hazard, but the penalty impoſed upon the Refuſer. And therefore in all Oaths there muſt be a concourſe both of the ſenſe impoſed by Authority, and of the private Senſe, Judgment or Conſcience of the party. And therefore if a party ſhould take an Oath in the Senſe propoſed by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority contrary to his own ſenſe, he were perjured: whereby it is evident that the ſenſe of Authority is not ſufficient, without the acquieſcence and conſent of the private perſon. And therefore it is very ſtrange, why that part of the Pannel's Explanation ſhould be challenged, that he takes it in his own Senſe, the <hi>poſterior</hi> words making it as plain as the light, that that ſenſe of his own is not what he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pleaſes to make of the Oath, for it bears expreſly, that no body can explain it but for himſelf, and reconcile it as it is genuine, and agrees in its own ſenſe: So that there muſt be a Reconciliation bewixt his own ſenſe and the genuine ſenſe, which upon all hands is acknowledged to be the Senſe of Authority. And if the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel had been of theſe lax and debaucht Principles, that he might have evaded the meaning and energy of the Oath, by impoſing upon it what ſenſe he pleaſed, certainly he would have contented himſelf in the general refuge of Equivocation, or Mental Reſervation, and he would never have expoſed his ſenſe to the world, in which he took this Oath, whereby he became abſolutely fixed and determined to the Oath, in that particular ſenſe, and ſo had no latitude of ſhuffling off the Energy or Obligation of the Oath. And it is likewiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, That the Caſes alledged in the Reply are true, <hi>viz.</hi> That the perſon is guilty of Perjury, <hi>ſi aliquo novo Commento</hi> he would elude his Oath, or who doth not fulfil the Oath in the ſenſe of the Impoſer. But that does not concern this Caſe: For in the foreſaid Citation, a perſon, after he has taken an Oath, finding out ſome new conceit to elude it he is perjured: but in this Caſe the Pannel did at, and before his taking the <hi>Teſt,</hi> declare the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>s in which he underſtood it; So that this was not <hi>novo aliquo commento</hi> to elude it. And the other Caſe, where a party takes it in the ſenſe of Authority, but has ſome ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, or concealed Explanation, it is acknowledged to be Perjury. But in this Caſe there was no concealed Explanation, but it was publickly expreſt, and an Explanation given, which the Pannel deſigned, and underſtood as the meaning of Authority, and had ground to believe he was not miſtaken, ſince upon that Explanation he was received and allowed to ſit and vote in Council.</p>
               <p>And as to that part of the Reply, that explains the Treaſon, there can be no Treaſon in the Pannel's Caſe, becauſe the expreſs Act of Parliament founded upon doth relate only to the Conſtitution of the Parliament: And I am ſure His Majeſties Advocate cannot ſubſume in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e terms: And therefore in the Reply he recurs to the general Grounds of the Law, That the uſurping of His Majeſties Authority, in making a part of the Law; and to make alterations in general, and without the King, are high and treaſonable words or deſigns, and ſuch as the party pleaſes, and ſuch deſigns as have been practiſed the late times. And that even the adjection of fair and ſafe words, as in the Covenant, does not ſecure from treaſonable Deſigns; and that it was ſo found in <hi>Balmerino</hi>'s Caſe, tho it bear a fair Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of an humble Supplication.</p>
               <p>It is replied, That the uſurpation of making of Laws is undoubtedly treaſonable; but no ſuch thing can be pretended or ſubſumed in this Caſe: For albeit the Pannel declares his Explanation to be a part of his Oath, yet he never meaned to impoſe it as even a part of the Law, or that his Explanation ſhould be a thing diſtinct, or a ſeparate part of his Oath. For this Explanation being but <hi>exegetick</hi> of the ſeveral parts of the Oath, it is no diſtinct thing from the Oath, but declared to be a part of the Oath <hi>de natura rei.</hi> And it was never pretended, That he that alledged any thing to be <hi>de natura rei,</hi> did ſay, That that was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and ſeparate, which were a contradiction. And therefore the Argument is retorted, the Pannel having declared, this Explanation was, <hi>de natura rei,</hi> implied in the Oath, he neceſſarily made this Explanation no addition or extention of the Oath. So that for all this Explanation, the Oath is neither broader nor longer than it was.</p>
               <p>And as to theſe words, <hi>I do not mean to bind up my ſelf in my ſtation, and in a lawful way, to wiſh and endeavour any alteration I think to the advantage of Church or State, not repugnant to the Proteſtant Religion, and my Loyalty.</hi> It is a ſtrange thing how this Clauſe can be drawn in queſtion, as treaſonable, when it may with better Reaſon be alledged, That there is not good Subject but is bound to ſay it. And albeit the words <hi>to endeavour in my ſtation,</hi> be words
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48501:100"/>contained in the Covenant, yet that is no Reaſon, why two words in the Covenant may not be made uſe of in another very good and loyal ſenſe. And there is no man that ſhall have the honour either to be entruſted by His Majeſty in his Council, or any other Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or to be a Member of Parliament, but he is bound by his Loyalty to ſay the ſame thing. And there was never a Clauſe more cautiouſly expreſt, for the words run, <hi>to endeavour any alteration I ſhall think to the advantage of Church and State.</hi> And tho that was ſufficient, yet the Clauſe is ſo cautiouſly conceived, that it contains another Reſtriction, <hi>not repugnant to Religion and his Loyalty.</hi> So that except it could be alledged, That a man by lawful means, to the advantage of Church and State, conſiſtent with his Religion and Loyalty, could make treaſonable alterations, and invaſions upon the Government and Monarchy, which are the higheſt Contradictions imaginable, there can be nothing againſt the Pannel. And albeit, the Clauſe, <hi>any alterations,</hi> might, without the Reſtrictions and Qualifications foreſaid, be generally extended, yet the preceeding words of <hi>lawful way,</hi> and the rational Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the emiſſion of words eſpecially before a ſolemn Judicatory leaves no place or ſhadow to doubt, that theſe alterations were no fundamental or treaſonable alterations, but ſuch as the frailty of humane Affairs and Conſtitutions, and viciſſitude of things and circumſtances do conſtantly require in the moſt exact Conſtitutions under Heaven. And the clauſe does not ſo much as import, that there is a preſent neceſſity of alteration, but it was a neceſſary and rational proſpect, That albeit at preſent all things under Heaven had been done to ſecure the Religion and Government, yet there might occur Caſes that would require new helps, alterations, and remedies. And it is not pretended in this Caſe for the Pannel, That he deſires to alleviate, or take off words truly treaſonable, or having an ill deſign, by the mixing of fair and ſafe, dutiful and ſubmiſſive Expreſſions, which indeed are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations <hi>contrariae facto.</hi> For there is nothing in his Explanation, that either in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, or in the words themſelves, being rationally and naturally interpreted, can infer the Crimes libelled, or any of them. And the Pannel's known Principles, and known Practices do not only clear that Loyalty that he has profeſt before the Lords of Juſtitiary, and inſtructed by unqueſtionable Docuements, but they put him far from the ſuſpicion of theſe damnable Principles related in the Reply, Of which the whole tract of his Life hath been an intire evidence of his <hi>abhorrency</hi> and <hi>deteſtation.</hi> And in the laſt place, It is thought ſtrange, why that ſhould be repreſented as an affront or diſgrace to the Government, That the Parliament impoſed a <hi>Test</hi> which the Pannel is not able to take ſimply. And it is not pretended, That he hath defamed, written or ſpoken againſt the <hi>Test</hi> it ſelf, or for the inconvenience of it; but only that he hath not been able to ſee the good ground upon which it may be ſimply taken. And this were to condemn him for want of ſight or ſenſe, when the Law hath puniſhed no man for not taking the <hi>Teſt,</hi> but only turned him out of the Government. And it is as ſtrange an Inference, That becauſe the Pannel declares, He believes the Parliament meaned no Contradiction and would take the <hi>Teſt,</hi> in as far as it is conſiſtent, that therefore he ſaid, the Parliament impoſed Contradictions: Which is ſo far from a rational Induction, that the Contradiction of theſe Subſumptions, in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity of Language and Senſe, is neceſſarily true. And therefore the laſt part of that Clauſe, <hi>in ſo far as it is conſiſtent,</hi> is a Conſequence inferred upon the former: <hi>viz.</hi> I believe the Parliament deſigned to impoſe no Contradictions: <hi>ergo,</hi> I take the <hi>Teſt</hi> as conſiſtent, and in ſo far as it muſt be conſiſtent, if the Parliament did not impoſe Contradictions, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they have not; and to convince the world, that in this ſenſe this Explanation is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable, it was propoſed in Council, and allowed, and therefore without the higheſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, it cannot now be quarrelled.</p>

               <p>SIR <hi>George Lockhart</hi> Duplies, That the Defender repeats and oppones his former De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences, which are no ways eluded, nor ſatisfied by the Reply made by His Majeſties Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate. And altho it be eaſie for the Kings Advocate, out of his zeal, to pretend and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue Crimes of the higheſt Nature upon Inferences and Conſequences neither conſiſtent with the Pannel's deſigns nor with his words and expreſſions, yet there cannot be a more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous foundation laid, for the ſecurity and intereſt of the Government, and the ſecurity and protection of the Subjects, than that Crimes ſhould be inferred but from clear, evident, and expreſs Laws, and plain palpable Contravention of theſe Laws, it being both againſt the Laws of God and Man, that a Man ſhould be made an Offender for a word, and eſpecially for expreſſions which according to Senſe and Reaſon, and conſidering the time and place where they were ſpoken by the Pannel. <hi>viz.</hi> as a Member of His Majeſties Privy-Council,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48501:100"/>and in preſence of his Royal Highneſs, and the Members of Council, and when required to take the <hi>Teſt,</hi> were ſafe and Innocent: and it were againſt all Law and Reaſon, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the Pannel either did, or deſigned to do any thing which may, or did import the Crimes libelled againſt him. And whereas it is pretended, That the Oath required and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by Act of Parliament was for the ſecurity of the Government; and that the Pannel by his Explanation does evade the Oath, by taking it only ſo far as it is conſiſtent with the Proteſtant Religion, and his own Loyalty, whereof he was Judge. It is anſwered, That the pretence is moſt unwarrantable, and the ſecurity of His Majeſties Government is not at all endangered (as God forbid it ſhould,) tho the Pannel, and a Thouſand more had ſimply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the <hi>Teſt,</hi> or had taken it in a ſenſe which does not ſatisfie the Law; it being compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to publick Authority to conſider, whether the Pannels Oath, in the terms of the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation wherein he did take it, does ſatisfie the Act of Palriament or not; And if not, there can be no rational conſequence inferred thereupon, but that he is holden as a Refuſer of the Oath, and liable to the Certification of the Act of Parliament, of not aſſuming and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in any publick Truſt: And no more was intended or deſigned by the Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament it ſelf, than ſtrictly to make the Oath in the true and genuine ſenſe and meaning of the Parliament, an indiſpenſible qualification of perſons admitted to publick Truſt. So that it is not at all material to diſpute, whether the Pannel's Explication can be looked upon as a full ſatisfaction of the Act, which whether it ſhould or not, it can import no Crime againſt him, it not being conſiſtent with Senſe and Reaſon, that a perſon who abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth the <hi>Teſt,</hi> upon the ſcrupuloſity of his Conſcience, albeit he be not capable of publick Truſt, ſhould be, notwithſtanding, looked upon as guilty of no Crime: and yet another who was willing to go to a greater length, albeit he did demur and ſcruple as to the full length, that he ſhould be reputed criminal and guilty of a Crime.</p>

The Pannel repeats and conjoyns with this the grounds above mentioned, contained in his Defences, <hi>viz.</hi> That neither the Crimes libelled, nor any other Crime, were ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended or made uſe of againſt any others, who did ſpread abroad Objections of an high nature which yet were ſo favourably looked upon, as to be conſtrued only to proceed from ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſity of Conſcience, as alſo the ſatisfaction endeavoured is in ſuch terms, and by ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſions, as do take in, and juſtifie the whole terms of the Explication libelled.</p>
               <p>It is of great moment, and whereof the Lords of Juſtitiary are deſired to take ſpecial no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, both for clearing the abſolute innocence of the Pannel's meaning and intention, and to take off all poſſible miſconſtruction that can be wreſted or detorted from the tenor and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the libelled Explication. That the Pannel was put to, and required to take the Oath, before the Lords of His Majeſties Privy-Council did paſs and publiſh their Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on explaining the Oath, and declaring the genuine ſenſe and meaning thereof, namely, That it did not tye to the whole Articles of the <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> ratified by Act of Parliament, <hi>James</hi> 6. and which, as to ſeveral Articles thereof, had occaſioned the ſcruples, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and alledged inconſiſtency and contradiction betwixt the laſt part of the Oath and the ſaid <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> and betwixt ſome of theſe Articles, and the Currant of the Proteſtant Doctrine, received and contained in the <hi>Syntagma</hi> of the Proteſtant Confeſſions. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Pannel at that time did think fit, for the clearing and exoneration of his own Conſcience, to uſe the expreſſions in the Explication libelled, and yet with ſo much duty and confidence of the Parliaments Juſtice, as to their meaning and intention, <hi>That the Parliament never intended to impoſe contradictory Oaths;</hi> and that he <hi>did take it ſo far as it was conſiſtent with it ſelf, and the Proteſtant Religion,</hi> not knowing then, whether the whole <hi>Confeſſion</hi> was to be reputed a part of the Oath, and doubting there-anent; and which the Lords of His Majeſties Privy-Council and his Sacred Majeſty by his approbation ſince, have thought a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of ſo great moment as it was fit to clear the ſame by a publick Proclamation; How now is it poſſible, that any Judicatory under Heaven, which proceeds upon the ſolid grounds of Law and Reaſon, and who (it cannot be doubted) will have a juſt regard to the intrinſick Principles of Juſtice, and to all mens ſecurity; that they can now believe all, or any of the Crimes libelled, ſhould be in the leaſt inferred from all, or any of the expreſſions contained in the ſaid Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication? But that on the contrary it was a warrantable allowance, and Chriſtian practice, condemned by the Law and Cuſtom of no Nation, That having ſcruples in the matter of an Oath which ſhould be taken in <hi>Truth, Judgment and Righteouſneſs,</hi> and upon full deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and with a full aſſurance and ſincerity of mind, That he did plainly, openly, and clearly declare the ſenſe in which he was willing to take it; and if Authority did allow it as the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine ſenſe of the Oath, the Pannel to be holden as a Taker of the Oath: And if upon far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration, Authority think not, that <hi>habetur pro Recuſante,</hi> and a Refuſer of the Oath, but no ways to be looked upon as a criminal or guilty perſon.</p>
               <p>And the Pannel repeats and conjoyns with this point of the Reply, that point in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, whereby he poſitively offers to prove, 1. That his Explication, and the ſenſe wherein he took the Oath, was heard, and publickly given and received in Council, and the Pannel thereafter allowed to take his place, and ſit and vote in that <hi>Sederunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:48501:101"/>
               <p n="2">2. The Pannel alſo offers poſitively to prove, That the tenor and terms of his Senſe and Explication wherein he did take the Oath, is contained in that Solid, Learned, and Pious Vindication, written by the Biſhop of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> in anſwer to the Objections and alledged inconſiſtencies and contradictions in the Oath, and which Vindication was publickly read in Council; and ſo far approved, that it was allowed to be printed and publiſhed, and was accordingly diſperſed and ſpread abroad. And it is not of the leaſt import, that the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords of Privy-Council, altho it does oft allow the ſame to be taken by the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, yet at the ſame time they expreſly declare the genuine ſenſe and meaning of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not to comprehend the whole Articles of the <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> which was not cleared before the Pannel's taking his Oath.</p>
               <p>And whereas it is pretended, That the Acts of Parliament libelled upon, againſt Leaſing-makers, depravers of His Majeſties Laws, do obtain and take place, where-ever there are any words or expreſſions that have a tendency in themſelves, or by a natural conſequence, and rational inferences, to reflect upon the Government, or miſconſtrue His Majeſties Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and that the Explication libelled is ſuch, and that it was found ſo in the Caſe of <hi>Balmerino,</hi> albeit it was drawn up by way of humble Petition and Addreſs to His Majeſty, and with great Proteſtations and Expreſſions of Loyalty. It is anſwered, The Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment libelled upon are oponed, and the 43d. <hi>Act, Par.</hi> 8. <hi>James</hi> 6. and the other Acts, making the depraving of His Majeſties Laws to be Crimes, do expreſly require, that Speeches ſo judged be perverſe &amp; licentious Speeches <hi>ex natura ſua probroſa</hi> and reproachful, and ſpoke <hi>animo defamandi,</hi> and which could not receive any other rational Conſtruction, which cannot in the leaſt be applied to, or ſubſumed upon the words, or Explication given in by the Pannel. And Law and Reaſon never infers or preſumes a Crime, where the thing is capable of a fair and rational Conſtruction, and where it was done <hi>palam</hi> and publickly, and in preſence of His Majeſties High Commiſſioner, and Lords of His Majeſties Privy-Council, whereof the Pannel had the honour to be a Member: Perſons committing and deſigning to commit Crimes, making uſe of Times, and Places, and Companies of another nature, on whom their ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions and inſinuations may prevail. But it is a violence to the common Reaſon of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to pretend, that a perſon of the Pannel's Quality, having the honour to ſerve His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in moſt eminent Capacities, and devoted to His Majeſties Intereſt and Service, beyond the ſtricteſt ties of Duty and Allegiance, by the tranſcendent Favours he had received, that the Pannel in thoſe Circumſtances, and in preſence of his Royal Highneſs and Lords of Privy Council, ſhould deſign to declame, and <hi>defacto,</hi> declame againſt, and defame His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Government: To ſuppoſe this is abſolutely contradictory to the common Principles and Practices of Law, and common Topicks of Reaſon.</p>
               <p>And as to <hi>Balmerino</hi>'s Caſe, it is anſwered, That the Lords of Juſtitiary are humbly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to call for, and peruſe the ſaid Petition, and Books of Adjournal, which was certainly a defamatory Libel of His Majeſties Father, of bleſſed Memory, and of the States of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the higheſt degree, being expreſly, that there was nothing deſigned but an innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Proteſtant Religion, and the ſubverſion and over-turning the Liberties and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Parliament, and the Conſtitutions of the Articles, and other things of that kind, which made certainly of it ſelf a moſt villanous and execrable Libel, containing the higheſt Crimes of <hi>Treaſon</hi> and <hi>Perduellion,</hi> and was not capable of any good ſenſe or interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but was abſolutely pernicious and deſtructive: So that it is in vain to pretend, that the ſaid Libel did contain Prefaces and Proteſtations of Loyalty, which no Law regards, even <hi>in ſimplici injuria &amp; maledicto,</hi> tho committed by a private perſon, <hi>cum praefatione ſalvo honore,</hi> or the like, and which were certainly ridiculous to ſuſtain in a Libel concerning Crimesof Treaſon.</p>
               <p>And whereas it is pretended, That tho others were guilty of theſe Crimes, it does not excuſe the Earl: that the Lords of Privy-Council cannot remit Crimes; and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the Kings Officers cannot prejudg his Intereſt. It is anſwered, The Pannel is very confident, that neither the Lords of His Majeſties Privy Council, conſiſting of perſons of eminent Loyalty and Judgment, nor His Majeſties Officers, were capable of any ſuch eſcape as is pretended: and if the tenor of the Pannel's Explication did in the leaſt import the high and infamous Crimes libelled, as beyond all peradventure it does not, it were ſtrange, how the ſame being contained in the aforeſaid Vindication, and the whole Clauſes thereof juſtified, that this ſhould have been looked on as no Crime, and allowed to be publiſhed. And the Pannel neither does, nor needs to make farther uſe thereof, but to convince all diſ-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted perſons, that his Explication can import no Crime.</p>
               <p>And whereas it is pretended, That the Crime of Treaſon is inferred from the fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, and from that Clauſe of the Pannel's Explication, whereby he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, he is <hi>not bound up by any thing in this Oath not to endeavour any alteration in a lawful way:</hi> which being an indefinite propoſition is equipollent to an univerſal, and is upon the matter coincident with a Clauſe which was rebellious in its conſequences contained in the Solemn League and Covenant. It is anſwered, That it is ſtrange, how ſuch a plain and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Clauſe, whereby, beyond all queſtion, he does expreſs no more than was naturally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48501:101"/>the Crime of Treaſon, which no Lawyer ever allowed except where it was founded upon expreſs Law <hi>&amp; Luce Meridiana Clarior:</hi> And indeed if ſuch ſtretches and inferences can make men guilty of Treaſon no man can be ſecure. And the words in the Pannel's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration are plain and clear (yet <hi>non ſunt cavillanda</hi>) and import no more, but that, in his ſtation, and in a lawful way, and conſiſtent with the Proteſtant Religion, and his Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he might endeavour any alteration to the advantage of Church and State. And was there ever any loyal or rational Subject, that does, or can doubt, that this is the natural import of the Oath? And indeed it were a ſtrange Oath, if it were capable of another ſenſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſigned for the ſecurity of the Government, ſhould bind up mens hands to concur for its advantage. And how was it poſſible, that the <hi>Pannel,</hi> or any other in the capacity of a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy-Councellor, or a Member of the Parliament, would have ſatisfied his Duty and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in other terms? And whereas it is pretended that there was the like caſe in the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed League and Covenant, it is anſwered, The Aſſertion is evidently a Miſtake; and tho it were, the Argument is altogether inconſequential: For that League and Covenant was trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in it ſelf, as being a Combination entred into without His Majeſties Authority, and was treaſonable in the gloſſes that were put upon it, and was impoſed by abſolute violence on the Subjects of this Kingdom. And how can the <hi>Pannel</hi> be in the leaſt ſuppoſed to have had any reſpect to the ſaid League and Covenant, when he had ſo often taken the Declaration, diſowning and renouncing it, as an unlawful and ſinful Oath, and concurred in the many excellent Laws and Acts of Parliament made by His Majeſty, condemning the ſame as ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and treaſonable? And whereas it is pretended. That the <hi>Pannel</hi> is guilty of Perjury, having taken the Oath in another ſenſe than was conſiſtent with the genuine ſenſe of the Parliament, and that by the Authority cited he doth <hi>commento eludere Juramentum,</hi> which ought always to, be taken in the ſenſe of him that impoſeth the Oath: It is anſwered, The Pretence is moſt groundleſs, and Perjury never was, nor can be inferred, but by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, or omiſſion of ſomething directly contrary to the Oath. And altho it is true, That where an Oath is taken, without any Declaration of the expreſs ſenſe of the perſons who take it, it obliges <hi>ſub poena Perjurii,</hi> in the ſenſe, not of the taker, but of the impoſer of the Oath, becauſe expreſſing no Senſe, Law and Reaſon preſumes there is a full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence in the ſenſe and meaning of the impoſer of the Oath: and then if an Oath be not ſo taken, he that takes it is guilty of Perjury. Yet there was never Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer nor Divine, Popiſh or Proteſtant, but agree in this, That whatever be the tenor of the Oath, if before the taking thereof, the party in expreſs terms does publickly and openly declare the ſenſe in which he takes it, it is impoſſible it can infer the Crime of Perjury againſt him in any other ſenſe, this not being <hi>Commentum excogitatum,</hi> after the taking of the Oath. And if this were not ſo, how is it poſſible in Senſe and Reaſon, that ever any Explication or Senſe could ſolve the Scruples of a mans Conſcience? For it might be always pretended, That notwithſtanding of the expreſs ſenſe wherein he took it, he ſhould be guilty of Perjury from another ſenſe. And that this is the irrefragable opinion of all Divines, of whatever peſwaſion, is not only clear from the Authority above-mentioned, even thoſe who allow of reſerved ſenſes, but more eſpecially by the univerſal ſuffrage of all Proteſtant Divines, who tho they do abominate all thoughts of Subterfuges or Evaſions, after taking of the Oath, yet they do always allow and adviſe for the ſafety and ſecurity of a doubting and ſcrupulous Conſcience, that they ſhould expreſs and declare, before the taking of the Oath, the true ſenſe and meaning wherein they have freedom to take it; and for which <hi>Sanderſone de Juramento</hi> is cited, <hi>Prelct.</hi> 6. <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. <hi>pag.</hi> 75. where his words are, <hi>Sane ut inter Jurandum omnia recte fiant, expedit ut de verborum ſenſu inter omnes partes quarum intereſt liquido conſtet, quod veteribus dictum, liquido Jurare.</hi> And an Oath being one of the higheſt Acts of Devotion, containing <hi>Cultum Latriae,</hi> there is nothing more conſonant to the Nature of all Oaths, and to that Candor, Ingenuity, and Chrſtian ſimplicity, which all Law and Religion requires in ſuch caſes.</p>

                  <hi>The Kings Advocate's Third Plea againſt the Earl of</hi> Argyle.</head>
               <p>HIS Majeſties Advocate conceives he has nothing to anſwer as to depraving, Leaſing-making, and miſ-interpreting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſave that this Oath was only deſigned to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Recuſants; and conſequently, the <hi>Pannel</hi> may thereby be debarred from his Offices, but not made guilty of a Crime. To which he Triplies, 1. If ever the Earl had ſimply refuſed, that had been true, but that did not at all excuſe from defaming the Law, for a defamer is not puniſhed for refuſing, but for defaming.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It he had ſimply refuſed, the Government had been in no more hazard, but if men will both retain their places, and yet take the ſame in ſuch words as ſecure not the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it were ſtrange to think, that the deſign of the Law being to ſecure againſt mens poſſeſſing who will not obey, that yet it ſhould allow them poſſeſſion who do not obey. Nor is the refuſer here in a better caſe than the Earl, and others, who offered to obey, becauſe it is the defaming the Law, as ridiculous, and inconſiſtent with that Proteſtant Religion: and Leaſing-making betwixt the King, the Nobility, and the people, the miſconſtruing, and miſrepreſenting, as hath been formerly urged, that puts the Earl in a worſe condition. And all thoſe arguments might be as well urged for any who had uncontrovertedly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened theſe Acts, as for the <hi>Pannel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas it is pretended, That the King emitted a Proclamation to ſatisfie Diſſenters; it is anſwered, That the Proclamation was deſigned for none who had been Members of Parliament, and ſo ſhould have known the ſenſe; but it was deſigned for meer ignorants, not for ſuch as had defamed the Law, which is ſtill here charged upon the <hi>Pannel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the Article of Treaſon, it is conceived, That it is unanſwerably founded upon the Common Law, diſcharging all men to make alteration of the Government; as to which there needs no expreſs Statute, that being the very eſſence of Government, and needing no Laws. Like as it falls poſitively under all the Laws that diſcharge the aſſuming the Royal or Legiſlative power, for to alter the Government, is inſeparably united to the Crown. Like as the Subſumption is as clear, the expreſs words not bearing, That the Earl reſerves to himſelf a power to propoſe to His Majeſty any alterations, or to concur to ſerve His Majeſty in making alterations; but owning in moſt general and arbitrary terms, to wiſh and endeavour any alteration he ſhould think fit for the advantage of Church or State, and not determining any thing that could bind him otherwiſe than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own pleaſure, for the word <hi>(lawful)</hi> is ſtill ſubjected to himſelf, and has ſubjoyned to it, <hi>as he ſhould think fit,</hi> which governs the whole propoſition; and in that ſenſe, and as the words are here ſet down, the greateſt Rebel in <hi>Scotland</hi> will ſubſcribe that Explanation, for there is no man but will reſtrict himſelf to a lawful obedience, provided he be Judge of the lawfulneſs. And ſeeing all Oaths propoſed for the ſecurity of Government, require a certain depending upon the Legiſlator, and not upon the Taker, it is impoſſible that that end could be attained by any qualification, how ſpecial ſoever, which is made to depend abſolutely upon the Taker, and not upon the Legiſlator. And we have often ſeen, how little ſecurity there is in thoſe ſpecious words, the very Covenant it ſelf having not only the very words above-repeated, but atteſting all the world to be witneſſes to their Loyalty and Sincerity. And as to the former inſtances, <hi>viz.</hi> Riſing in Arms, or oppoſing the lawful Succeſſor, there is no Covenanter in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but will ſay, he will do neither, but in a lawful way, and in his ſtation, and in a way conſiſtent with his Loyalty, for a man were mad to ſay otherwiſe; but yet when they come to explain this, they will only do it as they think fit, and will be Judges themſelves, and then will tell us, That defenſive Arms are lawful, and that no Popiſh Succeſſor ſhould ſucceed, nor no Succeſſor unleſs he ſubſcribe the Covenant. And whereas it is pretended, That no clauſe in the <hi>Teſt</hi> does exclude a man from making alterations, it is anſwered, That the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the <hi>Teſt</hi> allows are none at all but in ſubordination to Authority. And as to the two points above mentioned, it excludes all alterations as to theſe points. And as to the making fundamental alterations, this reſervation allows to make any alteration, and conſequently fundamental alterations; to preclude which Libertiniſm, this excellent Law was invented.</p>
               <p>Whereas it is pretended, That the Pannel deſigns not to add any thing as a part of the Law, but as a part of his Oath, it is duplied, Since the Oath is a part of the Law, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever adds to the Oath, adds to the Law.</p>
               <p>Whereas it is pretended, That the Crime of Perjury cannot be inferred here, becauſe all Divines allow, That the Taker of an Oath is ſtill allowed to declare in what ſenſe he takes the Oath; and that this is clear from <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> p. 175. It is triplied, That where
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:48501:102"/>there are two dubious ſenſes, Lawyers and Divines allow. That the taker ſhould clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which of the two he ſhould take; which is very juſt, becauſe to which ſoever of the two he determines himſelf, the Legiſlator in that caſe is ſure of him. But here it is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, That there are two ſenſes; nor does the Pannel declare in which of the two he takes it, or in what clear ſence at all he takes it, which is indeed <hi>liquido Jurare.</hi> But here the Pannel neither condeſcends, what particular clauſe of the Teſt is unclear; nor after he has condeſcended upon the Articles, does he condeſcend upon the ſenſe, but in general myſterious words, where he can neither be followed, or found out, he only takes it in ſo far as it is conſiſtent with it ſelf, and the Proteſtant Religion, reſerving the ſquaring all by his own Loyalty, as he did in the beginning declare, That he took it in his own ſenſe, by which general ſenſe, neither is the Government ſecure of any thing it does enjoyn, nor could he be puniſhed if he tranſgreſſed. Nor can it be doubted, but Perjury may be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by any equivocal or evading ſenſe, <hi>inter Jurandum,</hi> as well as by breaking an oath afterwards; which is very clear from <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> p. 138. The words whereof are <hi>alterum perjurii genus eſt inter Jurandum detorquere verba;</hi> and which is farther clear by the 28. <hi>page,</hi> but above all, from the principles of Reaſon, and the neceſſity of Commerce and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For if men may adhibit ſuch gloſſes, even whilſt they ſwear, as may make the Oath uſeleſs, what way will either Government or Commerce be maintained? And he deceives as much that deceives in ſwearing <hi>ſalvis verbis,</hi> as he who after he has ſworn, does break the Oath. Nay, and more too, becauſe the breaking may come from forgetfulneſs, or other accidents, but the evading by general Clauſes, which bind no man, does from the firſt inſtance originally make all Oaths uſeleſs and dangerous, and that this interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion eludes the Oath abſolutely, is very clear from what hath been formerly debated. For it may be argued, That the Earl broke the Oath in ſo far, as the firſt day he ſwears the Oath, which bears to be without any evaſion (and muſt be ſo, notwithſtanding of whatever he could ſay:) And the next day he gives in this evaſion, which is a down-right violation of that Oath, and inconſiſtent with it. Nor was this Oath forced, but voluntarily emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to keep his own places. And it was the greater Crime that it was done in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, becauſe that was to make it the more publick, and conſequently, the more to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent the Government.</p>
               <p>After this debate, which, according to the cuſtom of the Court, was <hi>verbatim</hi> dictate by the Advocates of either ſide, and written by the Clerk, and ſo took up much time; and the Court having ſate, at leaſt twelve hours, without intermiſſion, it adjourned till the next day, being <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 13th. of <hi>December,</hi> at Two of the Clock in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon: And then the Earl being again brought to the Bar, the following <hi>Interloquutour</hi> (that is Judgment and Sentence) of the <hi>Lords of Juſtitiary,</hi> on the foregoing debate, was read, and pronounced in open Court.</p>

               <p>HIS Majeſties Advocate adduced four Witneſſes, to prove the points of the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, remitted to the knowledge of the <hi>Aſſize, viz. John Drummond</hi> of <hi>Lundie,</hi> then Governour of the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> now Treaſurer Deputy: Sir <hi>William Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Patrick Menzies,</hi> Clerks of the Privy Council; and <hi>H. Stevenſon</hi> their under Clerk. Who deponed, <hi>That on the</hi> 4th. <hi>of</hi> November, <hi>the Earl did give in an unſubſcribed Explanation of the</hi> Teſt, <hi>which he refuſed to ſign:</hi> One of the Witneſſes alſo adding, <hi>That he heard him make the ſame Explanation, the day before, in Council, and that it was there accepted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then His Majeſties Advocate asked, if the Earl would make uſe of his <hi>Exculpation</hi> for eliding the Perjury Libelled, <hi>to wit,</hi> That he had emitted the ſame Explanation, before taking the <hi>Teſt,</hi> in preſence of his Royal Highneſs and the Council. To which the Earl anſwered, That ſeeing they had ſuſtain'd the Libel, as to the <hi>alledged Treaſon,</hi> he would not trouble them about the <hi>Perjury;</hi> eſpecially the matter of Fact, referred by the <hi>Interlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quutour</hi> to his probation, being of it ſelf ſo clear and notour.</p>
               <p>Fut the truth is, the <hi>Interloquutour</hi> pronounced was ſo amazing, that both the Earl and his Advocates, were ſtruck with deep ſilence, for they plainly perceived that, after ſuch a <hi>Judgment</hi> in the caſe, all further endeavours would be in vain, it being now manifeſt, that ſeeing the Earls innocence had ſo little availed, as that his plain and honeſt words, purely uttered for the neceſſary ſatisfaction of his own conſcience, and clearing of his Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, had been conſtrued, and detorted, to infer <hi>Leaſing-making, Depraving,</hi> and <hi>Treaſon:</hi> the Tongues of men and Angels (as ſome of his Advocates alſo ſaid) could not do any good, and therefore neither did the Earl, nor they object any thing, either againſt the <hi>Aſſizers</hi> or <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> though liable to obvious, and unanſwerable exceptions: Nor did the Earls Advocates ſay any thing to the <hi>Aſſize,</hi> as the cuſtom is, and as in this caſe they might well have done to take off the force of the <hi>Evidence,</hi> and to demonſtrate that the Depoſitions, inſtead of proving the Indictment, did rather prove the Earls defences. But, as I have ſaid, they now plainly ſaw that all this had been unneceſſary work, and, in effect, were of opinion, that after ſo black, and dreadful a ſence, put upon what the Earl had ſpoke and done, in ſuch fair, and favourable circumſtances, there could be nothing ſaid, before <hi>ſuch a Court,</hi> which might not expoſe themſelves to the like hazard, and more eaſily be made liable to the ſame miſ-conſtruction.</p>
               <p>But, upon this ſilence, the Advocate, taking Inſtruments, proteſts (whether in form only, or from a real fear, let others judge) for an <hi>Aſſize of Error,</hi> in caſe the <hi>Aſſizers</hi> ſhould <hi>Aſſoil</hi> or acquit: Whereupon the <hi>Aſſize</hi> removing was incloſed, and, after ſome time, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned <hi>their Verdict,</hi> which was read in open Court of this tenour.</p>

               <p>THE Earl, as well as the Lords of Privy Council, waited ſome days for the Anſwer of this Letter: But the Earl making his eſcape a day or two before it came, I ſhall take occaſion to entertain you, in the mean time, with an account of ſome thoughts that the Earl had ſet down in Writing, in order to ſome diſcourſe he intended to have made to the Lords of Juſticiary, before their pronouncing Sentence. And then I ſhall ſubjoyn the Motives and Arguments, which (as he hath ſince informed ſome of his Friends) did induce him to make his eſcape: Which, with what I have ſaid before, will give you a full account of all matters, till His Majeſty's return came, and the Sentence paſt.</p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:48501:104"/>
               <p>And firſt, he takes notice, That on <hi>Monday</hi> the Twelfth of <hi>December,</hi> the day of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment, the <hi>Court</hi> adjourned, before he was aware: And it being then late, about nine of the Clock, and after a <hi>ſederunt</hi> of twelve hours, He did not imagine, they would have proceeded further that night; but only heard afterwards that they ſat it out till two or three after midnight: And was ſurprized the next morning, to underſtand, that without calling him again, or asking at him, or hearing, or conſidering his own ſenſe of his own words, they had not only found the Libel relevant, but repelled his defences, and with one breath rejected all his moſt material reaſons of <hi>Exculpation,</hi> root and branch. This ſeemed hard, though the words had been worſe, and no way capable of a favourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction (which none, no not the Judges themſelves, can be ſo void of ſenſe, as to think really they were not) and this was ſo far beyond all imagination, that, neither the Earl, nor his Advocates did ever dream it could fall out, though all was not ſaid might have been ſaid; nor what was ſaid, ſo fully enforced as the Earl's Advocates could eaſily have done, if the caſe had not been thought ſo very clear, and the Earl his innocence ſo obvious and apparent, and they unwilling unneceſſarily to irritate many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
               <p>This great haſte, and ſtrange proceeding, did ſo ſurpriſe and aſtoniſh him (as I have ſaid) that it cauſed him, the next day when the Sentence was read, to keep deep ſilence, and ſuffer the <hi>Interloquutor</hi> to be pronounced, the <hi>Aſſizers</hi> choſen, and ſworn, and the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> received, and examined, without once offering to ſay, or object any thing, or ſo much as inquiring, at either <hi>Aſſizers,</hi> or <hi>VVitneſſes,</hi> whether they had not been tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with, and practiſed by promiſes, and threatnings; or whether ſome of them had not previouſly, and publickly declared themſelves in the Caſe, and others of them had not partially adviſed, and ſolicited againſt him; Which, as they are juſt, and competent Exceptions, ſo he was able to have proven them, againſt moſt of them, inſtantly, and fully.</p>
               <p>And indeed, as to ſuch of the <hi>Aſſizers</hi> as were <hi>Councellors,</hi> (whom, for your better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, I have marked in the Liſt of <hi>Aſſuzers</hi> thus, <hi>P. Cr.</hi> and had firſt ordered his Impriſonment, next, ſigned the Letter to His Majeſty, and then ordered the <hi>Proceſs,</hi> and therein manifeſtly fore-ſtalled their own judgment (had they done no more) it was a wonder, beyond parallel, That, neither their own Honour, nor the common decency of Juſtice, nor even His Majeſty's Advocate's Intereſt, did prevent their being impannelled on that Aſſize.</p>
               <p>But the truth is, the Earl did ſo far neglect and abandon himſelf, and give way to the Court, that he did not ſo much as open his mouth, to clear himſelf of the Perjury laid to his charge, which yet God Almighty was pleaſed to do, by the plurality of voices of the ſame Aſſize, who it appears plainly did bear him little kindneſs: For whereas Aſſizers do uſually return their Verdict, <hi>Proven, or not Proven,</hi> rather than <hi>Guilty or not Guilty,</hi> and ought alwiſe to do ſo, where the relevancy is <hi>in dubio,</hi> and eſpecially in a caſe of this nature, in which the alledged Treaſon is no overt act, and indeed no act, nor ſo much as a real ground of offence; but plainly ſuch a ſubtil, chimerical, and non-ſenſical conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that the finding it doth quite ſurpaſs the comprehenſion of all unbyaſſed men; It might have been expected that perſons of their quality would have choſen the more <hi>moderate form of proven or not proven,</hi> and not involved themſelves unneceſſarily upon Oath in adjudging the relevancy of a guilt, which ſo few are able to imagine, and none will ever make out; yet you ſee in their Verdict, that all in one voice they did find the Earl <hi>Guilty,</hi> in the moſt poſitive and ſtrong form; adding, for ſuperabundance, <hi>culpable,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, the better to demonſtrate their good will. Nor is it unworthy of remark, that when ſuch of the Aſſizers as were preſent at the Council declared the Earl Innocent of the Perjury (which His Majeſty's Advocate did only pretend to infer from the Earls alledged ſilence, or not ſpeaking loud enough, the firſt day, when he ſigned the Teſt) becauſe they heard him, at the ſame time, pronounce his explanation: Yet ſome other Aſſizers that were no Councellors, and knew nothing of the matter of fact, but by hear-ſay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all regard to the witneſſing of theſe Counſellors, their fellow Aſſizers, voted him <hi>Guilty:</hi> And ſo took it formally on their Conſciences, that he had ſaid nothing in the Council, at his taking the <hi>Teſt;</hi> albeit all the Council knew the contrary: (by which they are clearly perjured). Nay, ſuch was the earneſtneſs of ſome (who thought it ſcazce poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to carry the Treaſon upon words ſo ſafe and innocent) to have the Earl found guilty of Perjury, that it was particularly recommended to His Majeſty's Advocate to get him made guilty of that point, to render him for ever uncapable of publick employment. And the Clerk of the Aſſize was ſo concerned in it, that he twice miſreckoned the Votes, before he would yield that the Earl was aſſoiled, or acquit of the Perjury. And this, among other things, may ſerve to clear, how that whole matter was influenced and managed: For, as the Earl cannot be charged with Perjury the ſecond day, becauſe he ſwore none at all; ſo as little the firſt day, ſeeing whether he took the <hi>Teſt</hi> with an Explanation (as certainly he did)
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48501:104"/>or ſimply without ſaying any thing, It is equally apparent, there was no <hi>Perjury</hi> in the caſe: But it appears, their <hi>Aſſizers</hi> were of the Opinion, that the <hi>Indictment</hi> or Libel alone (as it was indeed the only evidence) was a ſufficient proof of the Earl his being guilty of <hi>Perjury.</hi> And indeed for any other Rule or Reaſon that occurs, They might as well have found him <hi>guilty</hi> of the <hi>Perjury</hi> as of the <hi>Treaſon:</hi> But the <hi>Aſſizers</hi> that were <hi>Councellors</hi> being under a particular check, apprehending they might be found perjured themſelves, if they had not acknowledged the hearing of the words, that all others preſent could have atteſted to have been audibly ſpoken, and ſome of themſelves have confeſſed to have heard, before they knew the tenor of the Libel; And, the great Crime of <hi>Treaſon</hi> being ſufficient to do the <hi>Job,</hi> it is like they judged it adviſable to give this inſignificant <hi>abſolution from Perjury,</hi> That their <hi>Virdict of Treaſon</hi> might have the greater colour, and ſhew of candor, and ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. However it ſeems to be without meaſure hard to be proſecute with ſuch a <hi>deadly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma</hi> of either <hi>Treaſon or Perjury;</hi> for you ſee, in their account, if the Earl ſwear with an <hi>Explanation,</hi> his <hi>Life</hi> is knockt down by <hi>Treaſon;</hi> and if without an <hi>Explanation, his Honour,</hi> which is dearer to him than his <hi>Life,</hi> is run thorow with <hi>Perjury.</hi> But, to compleat a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy beyond <hi>Bedlam,</hi> The <hi>Advocate</hi> urges, and ſeveral <hi>Aſſizers</hi> agree, at the ſame time, to condemn the Earl as <hi>perjured,</hi> for not <hi>explaining;</hi> and <hi>for Treaſon,</hi> for <hi>explaining: Quis talia fando?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place, the Earl's Papers contain ſome <hi>thoughts,</hi> and <hi>endeavours,</hi> to remove cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain miſtakes, which, he had good ground to believe, did ſo much prompt, and precipitate the Judges to pronounce ſo important a Sentence againſt him, upon ſo weak and ſandy foundations, and which were indeed either meer fancies, or ſo frivolous, that though they were true, they could never excuſe them before men, far leſs exoner them before God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. Where, laying down a true ground, that <hi>nunquam concluditur in criminalibus, &amp;c.</hi> and withal repreſenting, how <hi>his Advocates</hi> were queſtioned, in ſo extraordinary a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for <hi>ſigning their Opinion</hi> (which you have above <hi>Num.</hi> 32. Where you may ſee how fair, juſt, and ſafe it was) that now they dare no more plead for him; <hi>He ſays,</hi> He cannot be denied to plead for himſelf, as he beſt may.</p>
               <p>The firſt ground of miſtake then that he was to repreſent, was, that he knew it had been told them, it was very much <hi>His Majeſty's Intereſt,</hi> and neceſſary for <hi>the ſupport of the Government,</hi> to deveſt, and render him uncapable of publick Truſt: Which words had been oft ſaid, and ſaid to himſelf, to perſuade him that there was no further rigour intended: But as he is very confident our gracious King will never, upon any ſuch pretence, allow any innocent Perſon to be condemned, far leſs to be deſtroyed, in a picque or frolick, where his Majeſty can reap no advantage; So he is perſuaded, His Majeſty hath no deſign to render him miſerable, far leſs to cut him off, without a cauſe. And therefore concludes, it is only his misfortune, in his preſent circumſtances, never having acceſs to, nor being heard by his Majeſty, nor the Caſe perfectly underſtood by him, that hath made His Majeſty give ſo much as way to <hi>a Proceſs to be raiſed or led,</hi> far leſs to a <hi>Sentence</hi> to be pronounced againſt him. But in effect, as this Affair hath been managed all alongs, and <hi>ſo many</hi> engaged, in ſo extraordinary ways, to act, and write againſt him, firſt and laſt, nothing ſhould appear ſtrange or ſurpriſing: However, as their own Conſciences, and God Almighty, knows how they have been brought to meddle, and act, as they have done; So, one day or other, the World may likewiſe know it.</p>
               <p>A ſecond ground of miſtake, which, he ſays, may impoſe upon them, is a confidence of His Majeſty's <hi>Pardon</hi> intended for him, a pretence only given out to render the <hi>Condemnation</hi> more eaſie; yet indeed leaſt wiſhed for by thoſe who were readieſt to ſpread the report, and whereof the Earl had indeed more confidence than any that talked of it, if His Majeſty were left to himſelf, and had the Caſe fully and truly repreſented to him: but as His Majeſty needs not this falſe occaſion to make his clemency appear, which is ſo well known over all his Dominions, by far more true and genuine diſcoveries; ſo it were the heighth of injuſtice in their <hi>Lordſhips of the Juſticiary</hi> to proceed to ſentence againſt him, upon ſuch <hi>Apprehenſions,</hi> in caſe in their hearts they believe him innocent (as he certainly knows they do) beſides, they cannot but ſee their acting, upon ſo unjuſt a ground, will not only ſtain their names, and memories, but inſtead of alleviating, rather aggravate their guilt, both in their own Conſciences when they reflect on it <hi>in cold blood,</hi> and in the ſight of God Almighty: And if His Majeſty, on <hi>importunity and a third Application,</hi> ſhould give way to <hi>execution,</hi> as he hath already given way, firſt to the <hi>Proceſs,</hi> and then to the <hi>Sentence;</hi> or if (as ſome may deſign) <hi>Execution</hi> ſhall be adventured on, without the formality of a <hi>new Order</hi> (as the Proceſs was at firſt commenced, before His Majeſty's return, and ſo is not impoſſible) would not their Lordſhips be as guilty of his blood, as if they had cut his Throat?</p>
               <p>And in effect, theſe are the <hi>grounds</hi> and <hi>Excuſes</hi> pretended at this day, <hi>in private,</hi> by ſuch of his <hi>Judges,</hi> for their procedour, who are not yet come to have the confidence, at all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, to own directly what they have done.</p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:48501:105"/>
               <p>A third reaſon why <hi>his Exculpation</hi> was not allowed, <hi>he ſays,</hi> might be, becauſe the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaing of it might have brought other <hi>Explanations</hi> above-board, and diſcover both theſe who had made, and thoſe who had accepted them, and perhaps not have left <hi>their own Bench</hi> untouched. But as this Artifice will not keep up <hi>the Secret;</hi> And as this way <hi>of ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is neither juſt nor equal; ſo to all intereſted it is the meaneſt of Security; For his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Advocate hath already told us, that His Majeſty's <hi>Officers</hi> can never wrong him: And although the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>He</hi> ſhauld conceal what others had done, it might make themſelves more guilty, but not prove any <hi>Exoneration</hi> to thoſe concerned, without a down-right <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion:</hi> Whereas it is manifeſt, That if <hi>their Lordſhips</hi> had admitted the Earl's <hi>Exculpation,</hi> upon the ſure and evident grounds therein contained, it would not only have anſwered the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of his Caſe, but vindicated all concerned.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, he was to tell them, that poſſibly they might be inclined to go on, becauſe they were already ſo far engaged, as they knew not how to retreat with their honour: but, as there can be no true honour where there is manifeſt wrong, and injuſtice; ſo, in the frail and fallible condition of humane things, there can be no deluſion more dangerous and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious than this, that <hi>unum ſcelus eſt alio ſcelere tegendum.</hi> And here the Earl thought to lay before them, very plainly and pertinently, ſome remarkable and excellent Rules, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>L. Chief Juſtice Hales,</hi> a renowned Judge of our Neighbour-Nation, tells, he did govern himſelf in all Criminal Caſes; which (adds the Earl) if they took a due impreſſion, would certainly give them peace, and joy, when all the vain Conſiderations that now amuſe, will avail them nothing.</p>
               <p>The Rules are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Not to be rigid in matters purely conſcientious, where all the harm is diverſity of Judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>That Popular, or</hi> Court-applauſe, or diſtaſte, <hi>have no influence on any thing is to be done, in point of diſtribution of Juſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>In a criminal Caſe, if it be a</hi> meaſuring caſt, <hi>then to incline to mercy and acquittal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>In criminal things, that conſiſt only of</hi> words, <hi>where no harm enſues, moderation is then no injuſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>To abhor all private</hi> Solicitations, <hi>of what kind ſoever, and by whomſoever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>In matters depending, not to be ſolicitous what men will ſay or think, ſo long as the rule of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is exactly kept.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">VII. <hi>And laſtly, Never to ingage themſelves in the beginning of a Cauſe, but reſerve themſelves</hi> unprejudged, <hi>till the whole buſineſs be heard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the <hi>Earl goes on,</hi> and makes notes, for <hi>Additional Defences,</hi> reducible to theſe Heads.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>The abſolute innocence af his</hi> Explication, <hi>in its true and genuine meaning, from all</hi> crime or offence, <hi>far more from the horrible</hi> Crimes libelled.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>The impertinency and abſurdity of His Majeſty's Advocate's</hi> Arguings, <hi>for inferring the</hi> Crimes libelled, <hi>from the Earl's</hi> words.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>The reaſonableneſs of the</hi> Exculpation.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>The Earl's</hi> Anſwers <hi>to the Advocate's</hi> groundleſs Pretences <hi>for aggravating of his Caſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the firſt, The Earl waving what hath been ſaid from common Reaſon, and Humanity it ſelf, and from the whole tenour and circumſtances of his Life, comes cloſe to the point by offering that juſt and genuine <hi>Explanation</hi> of his <hi>Explication</hi> which you have above, <hi>Num.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I have delayed hitherto to take the Oath appointed by the Parliament to be taken, betwixt and the firſt of</hi> January <hi>next: But now being required, near two months ſooner, to take it, this day perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, or to refuſe:</hi> I have conſidered the Teſt, <hi>and have ſeen ſeveral Objections moved againſt it, eſpecially by many of the Orthodox Clergy, notwithſtanding whereof, I have endeavoured to ſatisfy my ſelf with a juſt Explication, which I here offer, that I may both ſatisfy my Conſcience, and obey Your Highneſs, and your Lordſhips Commands in taking the</hi> Teſt, <hi>though the Act of Parliament do not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply command the thing, but only under a certification, which I could eaſily ſubmit to, if it were with Your Highneſs's favour, and might be without offence: But I love not to be ſingular;</hi> and I am very deſirous to give obedience <hi>in this, and every thing,</hi> as far as I can; <hi>and that which clears me, is, that</hi> I am confident, <hi>whatever any man may think or ſay to the prejudice of this Oath,</hi> the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment never intended to impoſe contradictory Oaths; <hi>and becauſe their ſenſe (they being the Framers and Impoſers) is the true ſenſe, and this</hi> Teſt, <hi>enjoined, is of no private interpretation, nor are the King's Statutes to be interpreted, but as they bear, and to the intent they are made;</hi> therefore I think no man, <hi>that is, no private Perſon,</hi> can explain it <hi>for another, to amuſe or trouble him with (it may be) miſtaken gloſſes:</hi> But <hi>every man, as he is to take it, ſo is to explain it</hi> for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>and to endeavour to underſtand it, notwithſtanding all theſe Exceptions in the Parliament's, which is its true and genuine ſenſe;</hi> I take it therefore, <hi>notwithſtanding any ſcruple made by any,</hi> as far as
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48501:105"/>it is conſiſtent with it ſelf, and the Proteſtant Religion, <hi>which is wholly in the Parliament's ſenſe, and their true meaning; Which (being preſent) I am ſure, was owned by all to be the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Proteſtant Religion, founded on the Word of God, and contained in the Confeſſion of Faith recorded,</hi> J. 6. <hi>p.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>And not out of Scruple, as if any thing in the Teſt did import the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trair. But to clear my ſelf from Cavils, as if thereby I were bound up further than the true meaning of the Oath;</hi> I do declare, <hi>That by that part of the Teſt, that there lies lies no obligation on me,</hi> &amp;c. I mean not to bind up my ſelf in my ſtation, and in a lawful way; <hi>ſtill diſclaiming all unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful endeavours,</hi> To wiſh, and endeavour any alteration, I think, <hi>According to my Conſcience,</hi> to the advantage of Church, or State, not repugnant to the Proteſtant Religion, and my Loyalty: <hi>And by my Loyalty I underſtand no other thing than the words plainly bear, to wit, the duty and allegiance of all Loyal Subjects;</hi> and this Explanation I underſtand as a part, <hi>not of the Teſt, or Act of Parliament, but as a qualifying part of my Oath that I am to ſwear; and with it I am willing to take the Teſt, if your Royal Highneſs and your Lordſhips allow me. Or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, in ſubmiſſion to your Highneſs and the Councils pleaſure, I am content to be held as a Refuſer, at preſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which Explanation doth manifeſtly appear to be ſo juſt, and true, without violence or ſtraining; ſo clear and full, without the leaſt impertinency; ſo notore and obvious to common ſenſe, without any Commentary; ſo loyal, and honeſt, without ambiguity; and laſtly, ſo far from all, or any of the <hi>Crimes libelled,</hi> that it moſt evidently evinceth, that the words thereby explained are altogether innocent: And therefore it were loſt time to uſe any Arguments to enforce it.</p>
               <p>Yet ſeeing this is no trial of wit, but to find out common ſenſe; let us examine the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate's fantaſtical Paraphraſe, upon which he bottoms all the alledged Crimes, and ſee whether it agrees, in one jot, with the true and right meaning of the Earl's words; and (as you may gather from the Indictment) it is plainly thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I have conſidered the Teſt;</hi> which ought not to be done, <hi>and am very deſirous to give obedience, as far as I can,</hi> but am not willing to give full obedience: <hi>I am confident the Parliament never intended to impoſe contradictory Oaths;</hi> that is, I am confident they did intend to impoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory Oaths; <hi>and therefore I think no man can explain it but for himſelf;</hi> that is to ſay, every man may take it in any ſenſe he pleaſes to deviſe, and thereby render this Law, and alſo all other Laws, tho not at all concerned in this Affair, uſeleſs; and ſo make himſelf a Legiſlator, and uſurp the Supreme Authority: <hi>And I take it, in ſo far as it is conſiſtent with it ſelf, and the Proteſtant Religion,</hi> whereby I ſuppoſe that it is not at all conſiſtent with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; nor was ever intended by the Parliament it ſhould be conſiſtent: <hi>And I declare, that by taking this Teſt, I mean not to bind up my ſelf in my ſtation, and in a lawful way, to wiſh, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour any alteration, I think, to the advantage of Church, or State, not repugnant to the Proteſtant Religion, and my Loyalty:</hi> Whereby I declare my ſelf, and all others, free from all obligation to the Government, either of Church, or State, as by Law eſtabliſhed, and from the duty and Loyalty of good Subjects; Reſolving of my ſelf to alter all the Fundamentals, both of Law, and Religion, as I ſhall think fit: <hi>And this I underſtand as a part of my Oath:</hi> that is as a part of the Act of Parliament, by which I take upon me, and uſurp the Royal Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Power.</p>
               <p>Which ſenſe and Explanation, as it conſiſts of the Advocate's own words, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, every word, neceſſar to infer theſe horrible Crimes contained in the Indictment; ſo, to ſpeak with all the modeſty that truth will allow, I am ſure, it is ſo <hi>violent, falſe, and abſurd,</hi> that the greateſt difficulty muſt be to believe that any ſuch thing was alledged, far more received, and ſuſtained in judgment, by Men profeſſing only reaſon, far leſs Religion.</p>
               <p>But thirdly, If neither the Earl's true, genuine, and honeſt ſenſe, nor this violent, corrupt, and falſe ſenſe, will ſatisfy; let us try what tranſproſing the Earl's Explanation will do, and ſee how the juſt contrary will look. — And it muſt be thus.</p>
               <p>I <hi>Have conſidered the Teſt, nor am I at all deſirous to give obedience, ſo far as I can; I am confident the Parliament intended to impoſe contradictory Oaths; And therefore I think, every man can explain it for others, as well as for himſelf, and take it, without reconciling it, either to it ſelf, or his own ſenſe of it: And I do take it, tho it be inconſiſtent with it ſelf, and the Proteſtant Religion: And I declare, that I mean thereby to bind up my ſelf never (either in my ſtation, or in any lawful way whatſoever) to wiſh, or endeavour, in the leaſt, any alteration, tho to the advantage of Church, or State, and tho never ſo ſuitable, and no way repugnant to the Proteſtant Religion, and my Loyalty: And, tho this be the expreſs quality of my Swearing, yet I underſtand it to be no part of my Oath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now whether this contradictory Converſion be not Treaſon, or highly Criminal, at beſt, I leave all the World to judge; and to make both ſides of a contradiction, that is, both the Affirmative and Negative of the ſame Propoſition, Treaſon, is beyound ordinary Logick. <hi>Eſcobar</hi> finds two contrary ways may both be probable and ſafe ways to go to Heaven; but neither he, nor the Devil himſelf, have hitherto adventured to declare two contradictory
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48501:106"/>Propoſitions, both damnable, and either of them a juſt cauſe to take away mens Lives, Honours, and Fortunes.</p>
               <p>But where the Diſeaſe is in the Will, it is loſt labour to apply Remedies to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and muſt not this be indeed, either the oddeſt Treaſon, or ſtrangeſt Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very that ever was heard of? The Biſhop of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> ſees it not, witneſs his Vindication, ſaying the ſame, and more; nor many of the Orthodox Clergy, witneſs their Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; nor his Royal Highneſs, in private; nor at firſt in Council, nor all the Councellors, when together at the Council-board; nor the Preſident of the Council, nor the then Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Seſſion (now Chancellor) though he roſe from his Seat, to be ſure to hear; nor any of the moſt learned Lawyers, witneſs their ſigned Opinion; nor the moſt learned of the Judges on the Bench; nor the generality of the knowing Perſons, either in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or <hi>England:</hi> wonderful Treaſon one day ſeen by none, another day ſeen by ſo many! A Stander-by hearing the Trial, and the Sentence, ſaid, He believed the Earl's words were by Popiſh Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick <hi>tranſubſtantiate,</hi> for he ſaw them the ſame as before; Another anſwered, that he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily thought it was ſo; for he was confident, none could ſee Treaſon in the words, that would not, when ever it was a proper time, readily alſo profeſs his belief of <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation;</hi> but he believed many that profeſſed both, believed neither.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Head of the Earl's Additional Defence, contains the impertinencies and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities of the Advocate's Arguings. And here you muſt not expect any ſolid debate; For as there is no diſputing with thoſe that deny Principles, ſo as little with thoſe who heap up phantaſtical and inconſequential Inferences, without all ſhadow of reaſon. If a Stone be thrown, though it may do hurt, yet having ſome weight, it may be thrown back with equal, or more force: But if a man trig up a feather, and fling it, it is in vain to throw it back; and the more ſtrength, the leſs ſucceſs: It ſhall therefore ſerve, by a curſory Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, to expoſe his Arguments, which are in effect eaſier anſwered than underſtood; and, without any ſerious arguing, which they cannot bear, rather leave him to be wiſe in his own eyes, than by too much empty talk hazard to be like him.</p>
               <p>He alledges firſt, That <hi>the Earl, inſtead of taking the Teſt in its plain and genuine meaning, as he ought, doth declare againſt, and defame the Act that enjoined it,</hi> which is certainly a great Crime: But now, <hi>Inaſmuch,</hi> ſays the Advocate, <hi>as he tells us, That he had conſidered the Teſt:</hi> Which I have indeed heard ſay was his greateſt Crime; and that he ought to have taken it <hi>with a profound and devout ignorance,</hi> as ſome of our moſt inventive Politicians boaſted they had done. But the Earl ſays <hi>that he was deſirous to give obedience, as far as he could; whereby,</hi> ſays the Advocate, <hi>he inſinuates that he was not able to give full obedience.</hi> This is not the meaning; but what if it were, and that indeed he could not? Have not thouſands given no obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, yet even in Law are guiltleſs? And ought not that to pleaſe his Highneſs, and the Council, that is accepted of God Almighty, and is all any Mortal can perform? <hi>But the Earl,</hi> ſays the Advocate, <hi>goes on, That he was confident the Parliament never intended to impoſe contradictory Oaths; whereby,</hi> ſays the Advocate, <hi>he abuſes the People with a belief that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament did intend to impoſe ſuch.</hi> Wonderful reaſoning! All men know that Parliaments nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are, nor pretend to be infallible: And in our preſent Caſe, hundreds of Loyal Subjects complain of Contradictions and Inconſiſtencies, ſome way or other, crept into this Oath; And even the Council have yielded ſo far to their Exceptions, as to make an alteration up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, for ſatisfying thoſe ſcruples, far beyond any thing the Earl ſaid; and ſuch an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as, I believe, few dreamed of; and I am certain, none durſt have attempted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their expreſs command and authority: and yet, in the midſt of all this, the Earl's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable and honeſt Opinion, in behalf of the Parliaments good Intentions, muſt be pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a direct ſlander. But the Earl ſays, <hi>That every man muſt explain it for himſelf;</hi> and ſo, no doubt, he muſt, if the Teſt be either in it ſelf, or in his apprehenſion, ambiguous; otherwiſe how can he ſwear in Judgment? But this the Advocate will have to be a man's own ſenſe, and thereupon runs out, <hi>That hereby this Law and Oath, and all Laws and Oaths are rendred uſeleſs, and to no purpoſe: And further, the Legiſlative Power is taken from the Impoſer, and ſetled in the Taker of the Oath,</hi> which certainly is a moſt treaſonable preſumption. But firſt, although there be no reaſon to ſtrain, or miſtake the Expreſſion, yet the Earl did not ſay, <hi>That every man muſt take the Teſt in his own ſenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. The Council hath now explained the Teſt for the Clergy: Might not then the Earl, before their Explanation was deviſed, ſay, by the Councils allowance, which he had, <hi>That he might explain it for himſelf?</hi> For if an ambiguous Propoſition <hi>(the Teſt for example)</hi> may be reconciled to it ſelf two different ways; muſt not the Taker reconcile it, as in his own ſenſe he thinks it doth beſt agree with the genuine meaning of the words themſelves, and with the ſenſe he conceives was intended by the Parliament that formed it, eſpecially before the Parliament emit their own Explanation? And is it not juſter to do it ſo, than in any other man's ſenſe, which he thinks agrees leſs with the words, albeit they may be thought by others to be reconcileable another way?</p>
               <p n="3">III. All this looks like deſigned Miſtakes and Traps; for ſhould any man ſwear, unleſs
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48501:106"/>he underſtand? And where an Oath is granted to be ambiguous, can any man underſtand, unleſs, in want of the Impoſers help, he explain it for himſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Was ever a Man's explaining an Oath for himſelf, before taking it, far leſs his bare ſaying that he muſt explain it, before he take it, alledged to be, <hi>The overturning of all Laws and Oaths, and the uſurping of the Legiſlative power, and making of new Laws?</hi> Certainly to offer to anſwer ſuch things, were to diſparage common Reaſon.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, this is ſtrange Doctrine from the Advocate, who himſelf, in Council, did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, not only the Earl his Explanation, but that Explanation to the Clergy, contrary, as appears by their Scruples, to what they that took it thought either the Parliaments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, or the plain words of the Teſt could bear, and certainly different from the ſenſe many had already taken it in, and wherein others were commanded to take it. And whatever the Advocate may cavil to inſnare the Earl, ſure he will not allow that by his explaining this Oath he himſelf hath taken on him the Legiſlative power of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, far leſs, though he ſhould acknowledg it, will any believe that he hath, or could thereby <hi>make all Laws or Oaths uſeleſs?</hi> By this you ſee what ſtrange ſtuff he pleads, which deſerves no anſwer.</p>
               <p>But, ſays the Advocate, the Earl affirms, <hi>He takes the Teſt, only as far as it conſiſts with it ſelf, and with the Proteſtant Religion; by which he moſt maliciouſly inſinuates, that it is inconſiſtent with both.</hi> But, firſt, this <hi>only</hi> is not the Earl's, but the Advocates addition. Secondly, I would ſoberly ask the Advocate, or any Man, Whether the Teſt, as it includes the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in general, and conſequently all contained in it, was not either really, or at leaſt might not have been apprehended to be inconſiſtent with it ſelf? Elſe what was the uſe or ſenſe of the Councils explanation, wherein it is declared, That men do not ſwear to every propoſition of the Confeſſion, but only to the Proteſtant Religion therein contained? And if it was either inconſiſtent, or apprehended to be ſo, how could the Earl, or any honeſt Man ſwear it in other terms, with a ſafe Conſcience? But Thirdly, If Parliaments be fallible, and this Oath, as being ambiguous, needed the Councils explanation to clear it from inconſiſtencies, muſt the Earl's words, when he was to ſwear, <hi>That he took it in ſo far as it was conſiſtent,</hi> be in this Caſe underſtood as ſpoken maliciouſly, and with a crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal intent, when all Senſe, Reaſon, and Religion, made this caution his duty? And if it be ſo criminal for one going to ſwear, to ſuppoſe a poſſibility of inconſiſtencies in it, Is it not manifeſtly more criminal in others, plainly to confeſs and grant that there are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencies in it, <hi>after they have ſwallowed it in groſs,</hi> without any explanation whatſoever?</p>
               <p>But, ſays the Advocate, <hi>The Earl hath invented a new way, whereby no Man is at all bound to the Teſt; For how can any Man be bound, if he will obey only as far as he can?</hi> And yet it will be hard, even for the Advocate, tho he ſometimes attempts, indeed, more than he and all the World with him can do. To tell how a Man can obey farther: And I am ſure, that in a matter of this kind, <hi>viz.</hi> The free tender of an Oath, all diſcreet men will judge the Earl's offer both frank and obliging. Then he asks, <hi>To what the Earl is bound; if he be bound no further than he himſelf can obey?</hi> Manifeſt confuſion! and never either ſpoke by the Earl, nor at all pertinent to his caſe; beſides he freely acknowledges, that all men are bound to more than they can do; <hi>or ſo far as the Teſt is conſiſtent with it ſelf, and the Proteſtant Religion</hi> (a ſtrange doubting <hi>or!</hi> yet, I dare ſay, imports as much as His Majeſty expects of any, and more than the Advocate will ever perform) <hi>But,</hi> ſays the Advocate, <hi>who can determine to what the Earl is bound?</hi> Which ſays plainly, That either the Teſt agrees with it ſelf, and the Proteſtant Religion <hi>in nothing,</hi> or that <hi>the Proteſtant Religion is nothing,</hi> both which the Earl thinks far from truth. But the Advocate's reaſoning reflects far more on the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils Explanation, where it is plainly ſaid, <hi>That the Confeſſion is not ſworn to in the Teſt, but only the Proteſtant Religion contained in the Confeſſion;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> indefinitely is that which is ſaid to be ſworn to. Now, pray, is it not much worſe for a Man to ſay, <hi>That by taking the Teſt he ſwears only to the Confeſſion as it contains or agrees with the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> (which is in effect to ſet the Proteſtant Religion at variance with its own Confeſſion, and ſo to reproach and ranverſe the ſtandard, and make void the very ſecurity that the Parliament intended) than to ſay, <hi>That he ſwears the Teſt as it agrees with it ſelf and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion,</hi> which imports no ſuch inſinuation? But from theſe pleaſant Principles, he jumps into this Fantaſtick Concluſion, <hi>That therefore it cannot be denied but the Earl's interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation deſtroys, not only this Act, but all Government, and makes every Man's Conſcience or Humour the Rule of his obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But firſt, as to the whole of his arguing, the Earl neither invents, ſays; nor does any thing, except that he offered his Explanation to the Council, which they likewiſe accepted. Secondly, What mad inferences are theſe! <hi>You ſay, you will explain this Oath for your ſelf, therefore you overturn all Government, and what not!</hi> Whereas it is manifeſt, on the other hand, That if the Earl apprehending, as he had reaſon, the Oath to be ambiguous, and in ſome things inconſiſtent, had taken it without explaining it for himſelf, or reſpect to its inconſiſtency, it might have been moſt rationally concluded, that in ſo doing he was both
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:48501:107"/>impious and perjured. Thirdly, It is falſe, that the Earl doth make his Conſcience any other way the rule of his obedience, than as all honeſt men ought to do: That is, as they ſay, <hi>To be Regula regulata,</hi> in conformity to the undoubted <hi>Regula regulans, the eternal rules of truth and righteouſneſs,</hi> as is manifeſt by his plain words. As for what the Advocate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates of <hi>Humour</hi> inſtead of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> it is very well known to be the Ordinary reproach, whereby men that have no <hi>Conſcience</hi> endeavour to defame it in others.</p>
               <p>But the Advocate is again at it, and having run himſelf out of all conſequences, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts and inculcates, that the Earl had ſworn nothing. But it is plain, that to ſwear nothing, is none of the crimes libelled. Secondly, The Earl ſwears poſitively to the Teſt <hi>as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with it ſelf and the Proteſtant Religion,</hi> which certainly is ſomething; unleſs the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate prove, as he inſinuates, that there is nothing in the Teſt conſiſtent with either. And 3dly, If the Proteſtant Religion, and the Earl his reference to it, be nothing, then is not only the Council ſadly reproached, who, in their Explanation, declare this to be the only thing ſworn to, in the firſt part of the Teſt, but our Religion quite ſubverted, as far as this Teſt can do it.</p>
               <p>But next for the Treaſon, the Advocate ſays, <hi>That the Earl expreſly declares, he means not by the Teſt to bind up himſelf, from wiſhing, or endeavouring, in his ſtation, and in a lawful way, any alteration he ſhall think for the advantage of Church or State; whereby,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Earl declares himſelf, and others, looſed from any obligation to the Government, and from the duty of all good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and that they may make what alterations they pleaſe.</hi> A direct contrariety, inſtead of a juſt conſequence; as if to be tied to Law, Religion, and Loyalty, were to be looſed from all three; Can there be a flatter and more ridiculous contradiction? Next, the Advocate pretends to found upon the fundamental Laws of this, and all Nations, <hi>Whereby it is Treaſon for any Man to make any alterations he thinks fit for the advantage of Church or State.</hi> But firſt, The Earl is not, nor cannot be accuſed of ſo much as wiſhing, much leſs endeavouring or making any alteration, either in Church or State, only he reſerves to himſelf the ſame freedom, for wiſhing, which he had before his Oath, and that all that have taken it do in effect ſay they ſtill retain. 2dly, For a man to endeavour, <hi>in his ſtation, and in a lawful way, ſuch altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Church or State, as he conceives to their advantage, not repugnant to Religion and Loyalty,</hi> is ſo far from being Treaſon, that it is the duty of every Subject, and the ſworn Duty of all His Majeſty's Councellors, and of all Members of Parliament: But the Advocate by fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and miſapplying <hi>Laws of Nations,</hi> wreſting Acts of Parliaments, adding, taking away, chopping and changing words, thinks to conclude what he pleaſes. And thus he proceeds, <hi>That the Treaſon of making Alterations, is not taken off by ſuch qualifications, of making them in a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful way, in ones ſtation, to the advantage of Church or State, and not repugnant to Religion or Loyalty.</hi> But how then? Here is a ſtrange matter! <hi>Hundreds of Alterations</hi> have been made within theſe few years, in our Government, and in very material Points; and the King's beſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and greateſt Favourites have both endeavoured, and effectuate them: And yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the things were done according to the Earl's qualifications, inſtead of being accounted Treaſon, they have been highly commended and rewarded. The Treaſury hath been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the hands of a Treaſurer, ſometimes put into a Commiſſion, backward and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: And the Senators of the College of Juſtice (the right of whoſe places was thought to be founded on an Act of Parliament, giving His Majeſty the prerogative only of preſenting) are now commiſſioned by a Patent under the great Seal, both which are conſiderable altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Government, which ſome have oppoſed, others have wiſhed and endeavoured, and yet without all fear of Treaſon on either hand; only becauſe they acted according to theſe qualifications, <hi>in a lawful way, and not repugnant to Religion and Loyalty.</hi> But that which the Advocate wilfully miſtakes (for it is impoſſible he could do it ignorantly) is, that he will have the <hi>endeavouring of alterations</hi> in general, not to be of it ſelf a thing indifferent, and only determinable to be good or evil by its qualifications (as all men ſee it plainly to be) but to be, forſooth, in this very generality <hi>intrinſically evil;</hi> a Notion never to be admitted on Earth, in the frail and fallible condition of humane Affairs. And then he would eſtabliſh this wiſe Poſition by an example he adduces, <hi>That riſing in Arms againſt the King</hi> (for ſo ſure he means, it being otherwiſe certain that riſing in Arms in general is alſo a thing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and plainly determinable to be either good or evil, as done with or againſt the King's Authority) <hi>is Treaſon,</hi> and ſays, <hi>If the Earl had reſerved to himſelf a liberty to riſe in Arms againſt the King, tho he had added in a lawful manner, yet it would not have availed, becauſe,</hi> (and he ſays well) <hi>This being in it ſelf unlawful, the qualification had been but ſhams and contrariae facto.</hi> But why then doth not his own reaſon convince him where the difference lies? <hi>viz.</hi> That riſing in Arms againſt the King, is in it ſelf unlawful; whereas endeavouring alterations is only lawful, or unlawful, as it is qualified; and, if qualified in the Earl's Terms, can never be unlawful. But, ſays the Advocate, <hi>The Earl declares himſelf free to make all alterations,</hi> and ſo he would make Men believe that the Earl is for making All or Any, without any reſerve; whereas the Earl's words are moſt expreſs, that he is, <hi>Neither for making all or any, but only for wiſhing and endeavouring for ſuch as are good and lawful, and in a lawful way;</hi> which no Man can diſown, without denying common reaſon; nor no ſworn Councellor diſclaim, without
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48501:107"/>manifeſt Perjury. But the Advocate's laſt conceit is, <hi>That the Earl's reſtriction is not as the King ſhall think fit, or as is conſiſtent with the Law, but that himſelf is ſtill to be judge of this, and his Loyalty to be the ſtandard.</hi> But firſt, The Earl's reſtriction is expreſly <hi>according to Loyalty,</hi> which in good ſenſe is the ſame with <hi>according to Law,</hi> and the very thing that the King is ever ſuppoſed to think. Secondly, As neither the Advocate, nor any other hitherto, have had reaſon to diſtinguiſh the exerciſe and actings of the Earl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Loyalty, from thoſe of His Majeſty's beſt Subjects; ſo Is it not a marvellous thing, that the Advocate ſhould profeſs to think (for in reality he cannot think it) the Earl's words, <hi>His Loyalty,</hi> which all men ſee to be the ſame with his Duty and Fidelity, or what elſe can bind him to his Prince, capable of any quibble, far more to be a ground of ſo horrid an accuſation? And whereas the Advocate ſays, <hi>The Earl is ſtill to be judge of this;</hi> It is but an inſipid calumny, it being as plain as any thing can be, That the Earl doth nowiſe deſign <hi>His thinking</hi> to be the rule of Right and Wrong; but only mentions it as the neceſſary application of theſe excellent and unerring Rules of Religion, Law and Reaſon; to which he plainly refers, and ſubjects both his thinking and himſelf, to be judged accordingly. By which it is evident, that the Earl's reſtriction is rather better, and more dutiful than that which the Advocate ſeems to deſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate: And, if the Earl's reſtrictions had not been full enough, it was the Advocate's part, before adminiſtrating the Oath, to have craved what more he thought neceſſary, which the Earl, in the Caſe, would not have refuſed. But it is believed, the Advocate can yet hardly propoſe reſtrictions more full and ſuitable to Duty than the fore-mentioned of Religion, Law and Reaſon, which the Earl did of himſelf profer. As for what His Majeſty's Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate adds, <hi>That under ſuch profeſſions and reſerves, the late Rebellions and diſorders have all been c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rried on and fomented,</hi> It is but a meer vapour; for no Rebellion ever was, or can be, without a breach of one or other of the Earl's qualifications; which doth ſufficiently vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate that part of the Earl's Explanation.</p>
               <p>The Advocate inſiſts much, that <hi>Any</hi> is equivalent to <hi>All;</hi> and that <hi>All</hi> comprehends Every particular under it; which he would have to be the deadly Poyſon in the Earl's words: And yet the Earl may defy him and all his detracters, to find out a Caſe of the leaſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutifulneſs, much leſs of Rebellion, that a Man can be guilty of, while he keeps within the excellent Rules and Limitations wherewith his words are cautioned. I could tell you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that ſo imaginary, or rather extravagant, and ridiculous is this pretended Treaſon, that there is not a perſon in <hi>Scotland,</hi> either of thoſe who have refuſed, or who by the Act, are not called to take the Teſt, that may not upon the ſame ground and words be impeach't, viz. <hi>That they are not bound</hi> (and ſo without doubt both may and do ſay it) <hi>by the Teſt, in their ſtation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to wiſh and endeavour any alteration,</hi> &amp;c. Nay, I deſire the Advocate to produce the Man, among thoſe that have taken the Teſt, that will affirm, that by taking it he hath bound up himſelf never to wiſh or endeavour any alteration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the Earl's qualifications, and I ſhall name Hundreds (to whom his Highneſs, as you have heard, may be added) that will ſay they are not bound up.</p>
               <p>So that by this concluſion, if it were yielded, all <hi>Scotland</hi> are equally guilty of Treaſon, the Advocate himſelf, to ſay nothing of His Royal Highneſs, not excepted: Or if he ſtill think he is, I wiſh he would teſtify under his hand to the World, that, <hi>by his Oath he is bound up never to wiſh, nor endeavour any alteration he thinks to the advantage of Church or State, in a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful way, nor in his ſtation, though neither repugnant to the Proteſtant Religion, nor his Loyalty.</hi> And if this he do, he does as a Man, if not of Senſe, at leaſt of Honour; but if not, I leave a blank for his Epithets.</p>
               <p>But that you may ſee that this whole affair is a deep Myſtery, pray, notice what is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt the laſt part of the Explanation: <hi>This I underſtand as a part of my Oath. Which,</hi> ſays the Advocate, <hi>is a Treaſonable invaſion upon the Royal Legiſlative power, as if the Earl could make to himſelf an Act of Parliament, ſince he who can make any part of an Act, may make the whole.</hi> And then ſay I, farewell all Takers of the Teſt with an Explanation, whether the Orthodox Clergy, or Earl <hi>Queensberry</hi> (tho himſelf Juſtice General) who were allowed by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ſo to do; ſeeing that whether they hold their Explanation for a part of their Oath or not, yet others may; and in effect all men of ſenſe do underſtand it ſo: And thus, in the Advocate's Opinion, they have <hi>Treaſonably invaded the Legiſlative Power, and made an Act of Parliament to themſelves:</hi> Neither, in that Caſe, can the Councils allowance excuſe them, ſeeing not only the Earl had it, as well as they; but even the Council it ſelf cannot make an Act of Parliament, either for themſelves, or others. But, Sir, I proteſt, I am both aſhamed and wearied of this trifling; and therefore to ſhut up this Head, I ſhall only give a few remarks: Firſt, you may ſee, by the Acts of Parliament upon which the Advocate founds his Indictment, That as to <hi>Leaſing-making</hi> and <hi>depraving Laws,</hi> all of them run in theſe plain and ſenſible terms; <hi>The inventing of Narrations, the making and telling of Lies, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ttering of wicked and untrue Calumnies, to the ſlander of King and Government, the depraving of his Laws, and miſconſtruing his Proceedings, to the engendering of diſcord, moving and raiſing of batred and diſlike betwixt the King and his People.</hi> And, as to Treaſon, in theſe yet more poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48501:108"/>terms; <hi>That none impugn the dignity and authority of the Three Eſtates, or ſeek, or procure the innovation, or diminution thereof.</hi> Which are things ſo palpable, and eaſily diſcerned, and withal ſo infinitely remote both from the Earl's words and intentions, or any tollerable conſtruction can be put on either, that I confeſs, I never read this Indictment, but I was made to wonder that its forger and maker was not in looking on it, deterred by the juſt apprehenſions he might have, not only to be ſometime accuſed as a manifeſt depraver of all Law, but to be for ever accounted a groſs and moſt diſingenuous perverter of common ſenſe. The Earl's words are ſober, reſpectful, and dutifully ſpoken, for the exoneration of his own Conſcience, without the leaſt inſinuation of either <hi>reflection</hi> or <hi>ſlander,</hi> much leſs the <hi>impugning of the Authority of Parliament,</hi> as the Earl may appeal, not only to His Majeſty's true and Royal ſenſe, but to the moſt ſcrupulous and nice affecters of the exacteſt diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; beſides that they were firſt formally tendered in Council, for their approbation, and by them directly allowed: How then can any Man think, that they could be charged with the greateſt and vileſt of crimes, <hi>Leaſing-making, Depraving, Perjury, and Treaſon?</hi> But the Advocate tells us, <hi>That there are ſome things which the Law commonly forbids in general, and that ſome inferences are as natural and ſtrong, and reproach as ſoon or ſooner than the plaineſt defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> But what of all this? Muſt therefore ſuch generals be left to the phantaſtick appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of every wild imagination, to the confounding of the uſe of Speech, and ſubverting of humane Society, and not rather be ſtill ſubmitted to the judgment of common ſenſe, for their true and right underſtanding, and the deducing thence theſe ſtrong and natural inferences talk'd of? Of which good ſenſe, if the Advocate do but allow a grain weight, it is evident that the inferences he here Libels againſt the Earl, muſt infallibly be caſt, and by all rational unbiaſſed men be found ſtrange, unnatural, and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous.</p>
               <p>For, Sir, Secondly, pray obſerve theſe rational and ſound Maxims he founds his Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on, and they are manifeſtly theſe: Firſt, <hi>That he who ſays he will only obey as far as be can, invents a new way whereby no man is at all bound to obey.</hi> 2dly, <hi>That he who in the midſt of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of exceptions and contradictions, objected againſt an Oath injoyned by Act of Parliament, and ſtill unanſwered, ſays, That he is confident the Parliament never intended to impoſe contradictory Oaths, reproaches the Parliament.</hi> 3dly, <hi>That he that ſays he muſt explain an ambiguous Oath for himſelf, before he take it, renders all Laws and Oaths uſeleſs, and makes himſelf the Legiſlator.</hi> 4thly, <hi>That he that ſays that he takes this Oath, as far as it is conſiſtent with it ſelf, and the Proteſtant Religion, ſwears nothing.</hi> 5thly, <hi>That he that declares himſelf not tied up by the Teſt from endeavouring, in a lawful way, ſuch alterations as he thinks to the advantage of Church and State, conſiſtent with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Loyalty, declares himſelf, and all others, looſed from the Government, and all duty to it, and free to make any, and all alterations that be pleaſes. And</hi> 6thly, <hi>That he that takes the Teſt with an explanation, and holds it to be a part of his Oath, invades the Legiſlative Power, and makes Acts of Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon which rare and excellent Propoſitions, I dare ſay, The Earl is content, according to the beſt Judgment that you and all unbiaſſed Men can make, either of their Truth, or of my ingenuity in excerping them, to be adjudged Guilty or not Guilty, without the leaſt fear or apprehenſion of the iſſue.</p>
               <p>And in the third and laſt place, I ſhall only intreat you to try how the Advocate's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning will proceed in other Caſes, and what brave work may be wrought by ſo uſeful a Tool. Suppoſe then a Man refuſe the Teſt ſimply, or falls into any other kind of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity, either Civil or Eccleſiaſtick, or pays not the King's Cuſtom, or other dues; or laſtly, underſtands an Act otherwiſe than the Advocate thinks he ſhould, Is not his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment already formed, and his Proceſs as good as made? <hi>viz. That he regards not the Law; That he thinks it is unjuſtly or fooliſhly Enacted; That he will only obey as far as he can, and as he pleaſes, and thereby renders all Laws uſeleſs, and ſo reproaches the King and Parliament, and impugns their Authority and aſſumes to himſelf the Legiſlative Power,</hi> and therefore <hi>is guilty of Leaſing-making, Depraving His Majeſty's Laws, and of Treaſon; of which crimes above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, or one or other of them, he is Actor, Art, and Part: Which being found by an Aſſize, he ought to be puniſhed with the pains of Death, Forfaulture and Eſcheat of Lands and Goods, to the terror of others to do or commit the like hereafter.</hi> And, if there be found a convenient Judge, the poor Man is undoubtedly loſt.</p>
               <p>But, Sir, having drawn this Parallel, rather to retrieve the Earl's Caſe, than to make it a precedent, which, I hope, it ſhall never be, and chuſing rather to leave the Advocate than follow him in his follies, I forbear to urge it further.</p>
               <p>Theſe things conſidered, muſt it not appear ſtrange, beyond expreſſion, how the Earl's Explanation, ſuch as it is, did fall under ſuch enormous and grievous miſconſtructions: For, ſetting aſide the Councils allowance and approbation, (which comes to be conſidered under the next Head) ſuppoſe the Earl, or any other perſon called before the Council, and there required to take the Teſt, had, in all due humility, ſaid, either that he could not at all take it, or, at leaſt not without an Explanation; becauſe the Teſt did contain
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48501:108"/>ſuch things, as, not noly he, but many other, and thoſe the beſt of the Loyal and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Clergy, did apprehend to be Contradictions, and Inconſiſtencies: And thereupon had proponed one or two ſuch as the Papers above ſet down do plainly enough hold out, and the Biſhop in his Explanation rather evades than anſwers; would it not be hard, beyond all the meaſures of Equity, and Charity, to look upon this as a deſigned Reflection, far more a malicious and wicked Slander, and the blackeſt Treaſon? We ſee the Act of Parliament doth not abſolutely injoin the taking of the Teſt, but only propoſeth it to ſuch as are intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in the Government, with the ordinary certification, either of loſing, or holding their Truſts, at their option. We know alſo, that in Caſes of this nature, it is far more ſuitable both to our Chriſtian Liberty, and the reſpect we owe to a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, to give a reaſon of our conſcientious non-compliance, with meekneſs, and fear, than by a mute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, to fall under the cenſure of a ſtubborn obſtinacy. And Iuſtly, It is certain, and may ſafely be affirmed, without the leaſt reproach, that <hi>Parliaments are not infallible;</hi> as witneſs the frequent changes, and abrogations of their own Acts, and their altering of Oaths impoſed by themſelves; and even of this Oath, after it was preſented, which the Earl was not for alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo much as it was done, as I told you before: How then can it be, that the Earl appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before a Chriſtian Council, and there declaring in terms, at the worſt a little obſcure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe too tender, and modeſt, his Scruples at an Oath preſented to him, either to be freely taken, or refuſed, ſhould fall under any Cenſure? If the Earl had, in this occaſion, ſaid, he could not take the Teſt, unleſs liberty were given him firſt to explain himſelf, as to ſome Contradictions, and Inconſiſtencies, which he conceived to be in it, tho he had ſaid far more than is contained in his contraverted Explanation, yet he had ſaid nothing but what Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Liberty hath often freely allowed; and Chriſtian Charity would readily conſtrue for an honeſt expreſſion of a commendable tenderneſs, without any imputation of reproach againſt either King or Parliament How much more then is his part clear and innocent, when, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ſo many thought the Contradictions to be undeniable, yet ſuch was his well-tempered reſpect, both to God, and Man, to his own Conſcience, and His Majeſty's Authority, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and not after, the taking of this Oath, to clear himſelf (in the midſt of the many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and Scruples raiſed) of all ambiguitles in ſwearing, he firſt applies himſelf, for a ſatisfying Explanation, to the Parliament, the prime Impoſers, their true intentions and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine meaning, and then gathering it very rationally, from the Oath's conſiſtency with it ſelf, and with the Proteſtant Religion, the Parliament's aim and ſcope, and ſo aſſerting the King and Parliament's truth, and honour, he places the relief and quiet of his own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in his taking the Teſt with this Explanation, and in declaring its congruity with his Oath, and duty of Allegiance.</p>
               <p>The third Head of the Earl's additional Defences, is the further clearing and improving of his grounds of Exculpation, above adduced, and repelled: Which were, firſt, that before the Earl did offer his Explanation to the Council, a great many Papers were ſpread abroad by ſome of the Orthodox Clergy, charging the Teſt with Contradictions and Inconſiſtencies. 2dly, That there was a Paper penned by a Reverend Biſhop, and preſented and read in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and by them allowed to be printed, which did contain the ſame, and far more important things than any can be found in the Earl's Explanation: And conſequently, far more obnox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to all His Majeſty's Advocate's Accuſations. 3dly, That the Explanation upon which he was indicted was publickly by himſelf declared in Council, and by the Council allowed; ſo that the Oath was adminiſtrat to him, and he received to ſit in Council, and vote, by his Highneſs, and the reſt of the Members, with, and under this expreſs qualification.</p>
               <p>But, to all urged for the Earl's Exculpation, the Advocate makes one ſhort Anſwer, <hi>viz. That if the Earl's Paper did infer the Crimes charged on it, a thouſand the like offences cannot excuſe it: And His Majeſty is free to purſue the Offenders, when, and in what order, he thinks fit:</hi> which Anſwer doth indeed leave the Council, and all concerned, in His Majeſty's mercy: But that it doth no way ſatisfy the Earl's Plea, is manifeſt: For, the firſt ground of Exculpation, <hi>viz.</hi> That before the Earl did offer his Explanation, a great many Papers, writ by the Orthodox Clergy, and others, were abroad, charging the Teſt with Contradictions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the Earl merely to juſtify his Explanation by the multitude of the like Papers, and ſo to provide for an eſcape in the croud: But, the Earl having moſt rationally pleaded, that his Explanation was given in by him, after theſe many Scruples and Objections raiſed by others were abroad, it was a good Plea, from a moſt pregnant circumſtance, clearing both the deſign, and ſenſe of his words, from the foul aſperſions of reproaching, and depraving, thrown upon them: Seeing the words ſpoken by him under the motive of ſuch a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, by all fair rules of interpretation, inſtead of being judged miſconſtruing and depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, could only be underſtood as a ſeaſonable aſſerting of the Integrity of the Parliament's Intentions, and the uprightneſs of the Earl's Conſcience: Which Argument being in reaſon unanſwerable, it neceſſarly follows, that the Advocate's return to the firſt ground was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſufficient, nor pertinent, and that therefore the Exculpation was unjuſtly repelled. But next, The ſecond ground of Exculpation is ſo far from being anſwered by the Advocate, that
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48501:109"/>it does not appear it was ſo much as underſtood; For, the Earl's Argument being, That words allowed and approven by the Council, can never fall under the Accuſation, either of Leaſing-making, or ſlandering His Majeſty's Proceedings, or depraving Laws, and Acts of Parliament, as is evident in it ſelf, and granted by the Advocate, where he ſays that an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation, tho reflecting on the King and Government (which the Earl's was not) yet, if allowed by the Council, is to be ſuſtained. But ſo it is, that the Council hath allowed the words contained in this Explanation contraverted, both in themſelves, and alſo in their equivalent, and far more important Expreſſions: As for inſtance, not only by accepting the Earl's Explanation (as ſhall be cleared in the next place) but by giving warrand for the publication of the Biſhop of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> his Vindication; wherein, firſt, for obviating the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions objected from the Confeſſion of Faith, he poſitively aſſerts, that by the Teſt men do not ſwear to own every Article of that Confeſſion; and yet the Teſt binds expreſly to believe <hi>that Confeſſion to be founded on, and agreeable to the Word of God, and never to conſent to any alteration contrary thereto, or inconſiſtent therewith:</hi> So that he gives both the Teſt and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament the Lye. And then, for removing another Scruple, he tells us, That <hi>by the Teſt men are not bound up from regular endeavours to rectify or better the Eſtabliſhed Government, both of Church and State,</hi> which is clearly the ſame thing, (but not ſo well cautioned) with that which in the Earl's Caſe is made a ground of Treaſon: From which it unqueſtionably follows, that the Earl's words, <hi>having been allowed, and approved by the Council,</hi> could never, in Law, or Reaſon, be thereafter made a ground of accuſation, by any, much leſs by themſelves. Now I deſire to know where the Advocate, in all his Plea, doth ſo much as notice, far leſs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, this Defence; or what his telling us, <hi>A thouſand Offences of the like nature doth not excuſe one,</hi> either doth, or can ſignify? ſeeing this Argument for the Earl, inſtead of pleading excuſes, doth juſtify the matter, and for ever purge all ſhadow of offence, or ground of quarrel, which will be yet more apparent, when you ſhall add to this the third ground of the Earl's Exculpation, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Explanation, whereupon the Earl was indicted, was publickly by himſelf declared in Council, and by the Council allowed and accepted: Inſomuch, as, after he had given his Explanation as the ſenſe wherein he was free to ſwear the Teſt, the Oath was thereupon adminiſtrat to him, and he received to ſit, and vote as a Councellor. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is evident, That, by this allowance, and acceptance, the Earl's Explanation became the Councils, as much as if, after the Earl's pronouncing the words, they had <hi>verbatim</hi> repeated them, and told him, they were ſatisfied he ſhould ſwear the Teſt in theſe terms: And whether this ought not to be a ſufficient exoneration to the Earl, let all men judge. The Advocate makes a noiſe, <hi>That in the caſe of an Oath required, the Taker ought to ſwear it in the ſenſe of the Impoſer,</hi> (which none doubts) and then runs out, <hi>That the Earl in place of taking it in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers ſenſe, did unwarrantably intend a ſenſe of his own, to the eluding and fruſtrating of the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this, and all other Oaths.</hi> But all this is nothing to the purpoſe; for waving that in the Earl's Caſe it is moſt impertinent to talk of his obtruding of a ſenſe, to the eluding, and fruſtrating of the obligation of his Oath, ſeeing his Oath was not then given, or at all in being, it is expreſly alledged by the Earl, and notour, that the Explanation tendered by him, when called to take the Teſt, was accepted by the Council, and the Oath thereupon adminiſtrated, and ſo the Earl freely joins iſſue with the Advocate, and acknowledging that the Taker of the Oath ought to ſwear in the ſenſe of the Impoſer, <hi>ſubſumes in terminis,</hi> that he himſelf did ſwear ſo, and not otherwiſe, inaſmuch as he did ſwear in a ſenſe accepted by the Council, before he gave his Oath, as is evident. 1. By their commanding him to ſit after he had ſworn; and 2. In that neither the Advocate, nor any other, had ever the confidence to quarrel his ſitting, as a breach of the Law, which no doubt they had done, if not convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that by taking the Oath he had ſatisfied the Act of Parliament; which things, in true dealing, and the conſtruction of all honeſt men, are the ſame as if the Oath had been requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of him by the Council, in the very ſenſe and words of this Explanation. Neither is it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial whether the Explanation, offered by the Earl, doth deſerve (as certainly it doth not) theſe many ill names, which the Advocate would fix upon it; becauſe, though it had been much worſe than it is, yet being offered to the Council, and ſubmitted to their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and they having accepted of it, the thing became <hi>quaſi res judicata,</hi> and cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, without ſubverting the ſureſt Rules, both of Truth, and Government. The Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate indeed tells us, 1. <hi>That the Council heard not the Earl's Explanation:</hi> But I have already told you, they did hear it, and the Earl is ſtill ready to prove it: And ſuppoſe ſome ſay they did not hear it diſtinctly. (As what thing ſpoke in Council is diſtinctly heard and conſidered by all?) Yet it being certain that they did all approve it, it is ſufficient to the Earl: And it is only their concern, whether in approving what they did not hear, they obſerved their Oath <hi>De fideli, &amp;c.</hi> or not. His Highneſs, who the Earl was moſt concerned ſhould hear, did certainly hear, as himſelf afterwards acknowledged. 2. The Advocate ſays, <hi>That the hearing and allowing the Earl to ſit, is no relevant Plea; yea further, though all the Council had allowed him that day, yet any of his Majeſty's Officers might have quarrelled him the next day.</hi> But firſt, I would gladly know, upon what head? For if upon obtruding a ſenſe of his own, it is undeniable
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48501:109"/>that whatever the ſenſe was, the obtruding of it was purged by the Council's acceptation, and it became theirs, and was no more his. But if the Advocate doth think, that even the matter of the Explanation, though allowed and accepted, may ſtill be quarrelled: Then; 1. I hope, he will conſider in what terms he doth it; for if he charge it after it becomes the Councils (as in truth he hath done already) with the ſame liberty wherewith he treats it as the Earl's, he runs fair to make himſelf the <hi>arranteſt Defamer</hi> and <hi>Slanderer</hi> of the King and Council, that ever yet attempted it. But 2dly, It merits a worſe name than I am free to give it, to ſay, That an Explanation allowed by the Council, in the adminiſtrating of an Oath proper to be adminiſtrat by them, doth not ſecure the Taker as to that ſenſe, both in Law and Conſcience: Seeing in effect this quite takes away the beſt grounds of aſſurance among men, and turns their greateſt ſecurity to their greateſt ſnare. And 3dly, If this be ſound Doctrine, it is worth the enquiring, what ſecurity the Clergy, to whom the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, as you have heard, did indulge an Explanation, have thereby obtained: For as to ſuch Laicks as did only at their own hand take hold of, and ſnatch at this Indulgence, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them by the Councils Act, it is clear their doom is dight. It is not here debated how far that Explication of the Council's may ſatisfy, and quiet Conſcience, let ſuch concerned ſee to it. Some pleaſe themſelves with a general notion, That if the ſenſe given by the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator be ſound, then it is alſo ſafe whether it be agreeable to the plain and genuine mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Oath or not; nay, whether it be agreeable to the ſenſe of the firſt Impoſers, or not: But others, who conſider more tenderly what it is to ſwear in Truth, and in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, think it rather a prophanation, and a ſinful preferring of the Credit of Men to the glory of the Almighty, to offer to ſmooth an Oath by a diſagreeable interpretation, when in effect the Oath it ſelf ought to be changed: But the thing in queſtion <hi>is about the ſecurity of life and fortune;</hi> for ſeeing the Council's Explanation is, at leaſt, to ſay no worſe, liable enough to the Calumnies of an inventive malice, and the Advocate telleth us, <hi>Though all the Ceuncil had allowed a man to ſwear with an Explanation, yet any of His Majeſty's Officers may, the next day, quarrel him;</hi> it is evident that this allowance can afford him no ſecurity. It is true, the Advocate may alledge, and poſſibly find a difference betwixt the Council's <hi>emitting,</hi> and their <hi>accepting</hi> of an Explanation. But as in truth there is none, more than betwixt a <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat</hi> and a <hi>Ratihabition;</hi> ſo I am confident, if ever the thing come to be queſtioned, this Pretence will evaniſh, and come to nothing.</p>
               <p>It is likewiſe to be remembred, That when the Earl, the next day after he took the Teſt, was queſtioned for the Explanation he had made, and required to exhibit a Copy (which was afterwards made the ground of his Indictment) ſo ſoon as he obſerved that ſome began to carp, he refuſed to ſign it, demanded it back, and would have deſtroyed it, as you have heard, which were all clear Acts of diſowning, and retracting, for eviting offence, and of themſelves ſufficient to have prevented any further enquiry; there being nothing more juſt and human, than that words, though at the firſt hearing, offenſive; yet if inſtantly retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, when queſtioned, ſhould be paſt: But this, as well as other things, muſt in the Earl's Caſe be ſingular; and whether he plead the <hi>Councils allowing,</hi> or his own <hi>diſowning</hi> (as in effect he doth both) it is equally to no purpoſe, the thing determined muſt be accompliſhed. You heard before, how that a Reverend Biſhop, and many of the Orthodox Clergy, did take a far greater liberty of Explanation than the Earl pretended to: you ſee alſo that firſt the Council allows his words, whereupon he reſts: And when he finds that they begin to challenge, he is willing to diſown: And withal, it is undeniable, and acknowledged by the Council them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that the Teſt, as it ſtands in the Act of Parliament, is ambiguous, and needs to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained: And the Earl may confidently aver, that of all the Explanations that have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered (even the Councils not excepted) his is the moſt ſafe, ſound, and leaſt diſagreeable to the Parliament's true ſenſe and meaning. And yet, when all others eſcape, he alone muſt be ſeiſed; and for a thing ſo openly innocent, clearly juſtifiable, and undeniably allowed, found guilty of the worſt of Crimes, even <hi>Leaſing-making, Leaſing-telling, Depraving of Laws, and Treaſon;</hi> but all theſe things God Almighty ſees, and to him the Judgment yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs</p>
               <p>And thus I leave this Diſcouſe ſhutting it up with the Caſe of Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> plainly parallel to the Earl's, to ſhew how much he was more favourably dealt with by the King, and Government, in thoſe days, than the Earl now is, though he live under a much more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and juſt Prince, than that worthy Prelate did; for <hi>Cranmer</hi> being called and promoted by <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. of <hi>England</hi> to be Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and finding an Oath was to be offered to him, which, in his apprehenſion, would bind him up from what he accounted his duty, he altogether declined the Dignity and Preferment, unleſs he were allowed to take the Oath with ſuch an Explanation as he himſelf propoſed, for ſalving of his Conſcience; and tho this Oath was no other than the Statute, and ſolemn Oath, that all his Predeceſſors in that See, and all the mitered Clergy in <hi>England,</hi> had ſworn, yet he was admitted to take it, as you ſee in <hi>Fuller</hi>'s Church Hiſt. of <hi>Britain,</hi> lib. 5. p. 185, and 186. with this formal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtation.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Nor did that excellent Perſon, ſays Mr. <hi>Fuller,</hi> ſmother this privately in a corner, but publickly interpoſed it three ſeveral times; once in the <hi>Charter-houſe,</hi> before authentick Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; again upon his bended knees, before the high Altar, in view and hearing of many People, and Biſhops beholding him, when he was conſecrated; and the third time, when he received the Pall, in the ſame place.</p>
               <p>Now would it not be very ſtrange if the like liberty ſhould not be allowed to the Earl, under His Majeſty, in reference to the Teſt, which <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIIth, a Prince that ſtood as much on his Prerogative as ever any, did vouchſafe to this <hi>Thomas Cranmer,</hi> who, as another Hiſtorian obſerves, <hi>acted fairly, and above-board:</hi> But there wanted then the high and excellent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the great Miniſters, the rare fidelity of Councellors, ſound Religion and tender piety of Biſhops, ſolid Law and Learning of Advocates, incorruptible Integrity of Judges, and upright honeſty of Aſſizers, that now we have, to get Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> accuſed, and condemned, for <hi>Leaſing-making, depraving Laws, Perjury,</hi> and <hi>Treaſon,</hi> to which Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation his Explanation was certainly no leſs obnoxious than the Earl's.</p>
               <p>But I haſten to the fourth, and laſt Head of the Earl's Additional Defences, <hi>viz.</hi> The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving certain groundleſs Pretences, alledged by the Advocate, for aggravating the Earl's Offence: As 1. <hi>That the Earl, being a Peer, and Member of Parliament, ſhould have known the ſenſe of the Parliament, and that neither the Scruples of the Clergy, nor the Council's Proclamation, deſigned for meer Ignorants, could any way excuſe the Earl for offering ſuch an Explanation.</hi> But, firſt, the Advocate might have remembred, that in another Paſſage he taxes the Earl as having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated in Parliament againſt the Teſt, whereby it is eaſie to gather, that the Earl having been in the matter of the Teſt a diſſenter, this quality doth rather juſtify than aggravate the Earl's Scrupling. 2dly, If the Proclamation was deſigned for the meer Ignorants of the Clergy, as the Advocate calls them, who knew nothing of what had paſt in Parliament, an Explanation was far more neceſſary for the Earl, who knows ſo little of what the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate alledges to have paſt in Parliament, <hi>viz. That the Confeſſion of Faith was not to be ſworn to as a part of the Teſt,</hi> that of neceſſity (as I think) he muſt know the contrary; Inaſmuch as, firſt, this is obvious from the expreſs tenor of the Teſt, which binds <hi>to own, and profeſs the true Proteſtant Religion, contained in the</hi> Confeſſion of Faith, <hi>and to believe the ſame to be agreeable to the Word of God; as alſo to adhere thereto, and never to conſent to any change contrary to, or inconſiſtent with the ſaid Proteſtant Religion, and Confeſſion of Faith:</hi> Which to common ſenſe appears as plain, and evident, as can be contrived, or deſired. But 2dly, It is very well known, that it was expreſly endeavoured, and carried in Parliament, that the <hi>Confeſſion of Faith</hi> ſhould be a part of the Teſt and Oath: For the <hi>Confeſſion of Faith</hi> being deſigned to be ſworn to, by an Act, for ſecuring the Proteſtant Religion (which you have heard was prepared in the Articles, but afterwards thrown out) when this Act for the Teſt was brought into the Parliament, ſome days after, by the Biſhop of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and others, the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> was deſignedly left out of it: But it being again debated that the bare naming of the Proteſtant Religion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out condeſcending on a Standard for it, was not ſufficient, the <hi>Confeſſion of Faith</hi> was of new added: And, after the affirmative Clauſe for owning it, and adhering to it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:48501:110"/>upon a new motion, the negative, <hi>never to conſent to any alteration, contrary to, or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the ſaid Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> was alſo ſubjoined: But not without a new debate and oppoſition made againſt the words, And <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> by the Biſhop of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> until at length he alſo yielded; All which, it is hoped, was done for ſome purpoſe: And if, at that time, any had doubted of the thing, he had certainly been judged moſt ridiculous: For it was by that addition concluded by all, That the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> was to be ſworn. And further, it appears plainly, by the Biſhop of <hi>Edinburgh his Vindication,</hi> that, when he wrote it, he believed the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> was to be ſworn to, for he takes pains to juſtify it (though calumniouſly enough) alledging, <hi>That it was haſtily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled, in the ſhort ſpace of four days, by ſome Barons and Miniſters, in the infancy of our Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Where, by the by, you ſee that he makes no reckoning of what the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to which the Teſt refers, expreſly bears, <hi>viz. That that ſecond Ratification</hi> 1567. which we only have recorded, <hi>was no leſs then ſeven years after this Confeſſion was firſt exhibited, and approven Anno</hi> 1560. But moreover, he tells us, <hi>That the Doctors of</hi> Aberdeen, <hi>who refuſed the</hi> Covenant, <hi>were yet willing not only to ſubſcribe, but to ſwear this</hi> Confeſſion of Faith. Which again, to anſwer the Biſhops Critick of <hi>Four days,</hi> was more than 70. years after it was univerſally received. It's true, that, when the Biſhop finds himſelf ſtraitned how to anſwer Objections, he is forced to make uſe of the new Gloſs (I ſhall not call it of <hi>Orleans</hi>) whereby the Proteſtant Religion is made to be ſworn to only as far as every Man pleaſes to interpret, and as far as may be conſiſtent with any new principles of State. But the Parliament certainly (I do not ſpeak Ironically) did intend by this Teſt, to ſwear and aſſert the <hi>True Proteſtant Religion, and the ſaid Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> whatever may be now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. The Earl could not alſo but very well remember what his Highneſs had ſaid to himſelf, about the inſerting of the <hi>Confeſſion;</hi> and no doubt, the Advocate, if ingenuous, knows all this: For the thing was at that time matter of common talk, and indeed, till Papers objecting contradictions, and inconſiſtencies betwixt the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Teſt,</hi> began to be ſo numerous (which was about the end of <hi>October</hi>) that there was no poſſibility left to anſwer them, but by alledging, <hi>That in the</hi> Teſt <hi>men do not ſwear to every article and propoſition of the Confeſſion, but only to the Proteſtant Religion therein contained,</hi> this point was never doubted. And whether this anſwer be true, and a ſolid Vindication, conſonant to the words of the Teſt, or a circulating evaſion enervating all its force, let others judge. But the Advocate ſays, <hi>When it was moved in Parliament to read the Confeſſion, it was waved:</hi> Moſt true; and the reaſon given by the Biſhops for it was, <hi>That it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, they knew it, and it was already inſert in the Acts of Parliament:</hi> And, the truth was, the reading of it would have ſpent more time than was allowed on examining the whole Teſt. It was lik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> wiſe late, after a long <hi>Sederunt,</hi> and it was reſolved to have the Act paſſed that night, and ſo it went on: But it was likewiſe moved <hi>to read the Covenant, ſeeing it was to be diſclaimed,</hi> and this was flatly refuſed. And will the Advocate thence infer, That by the <hi>Teſt</hi> the <hi>Covenant</hi> is not abjured, albeit it be moſt certain, that many in the Parliament, at that time, had never read the one or the other? But to follow the Advocate's excurſions, and anſwer them more particularly: The motion for reading the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> being made on this very occaſion, <hi>Becauſe it was to be inſert in the</hi> Teſt <hi>and ſworn to,</hi> concludes enough againſt him: For no body can be ſo effronted as to ſay, it was uſed in Parliament as an argument not to read it, becauſe it was not to be ſworn to, but (though it coſt a debate) it was plainly agreed to be ſworn to, and therefore inſert. 2dly, Can any man doubt, the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> was to be ſworn to, when it is notour that ſeverals who were members of Parliament, and, by reaſon of offices they enjoyed, were called to ſwear the <hi>Teſt,</hi> pretending, with reaſon, tenderneſs of an Oath, did, before ſwearing, make a faſhion at leaſt of reading and ſtudying the <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> to ſatisfy themſelves how far they might ſwear it. And that this was done by an Hundred, I can atteſt themſelves. Laſtly, It is certain that, when, in the end of <hi>October,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> did quarrel Sir <hi>George Lockhart,</hi> for cauſing the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> to be inſert in the <hi>Teſt,</hi> and he anſwered that without it a <hi>Turk</hi> might ſign the <hi>Teſt,</hi> it was not then pretended by the Biſhop that the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> was not to be ſworn to, and therefore he at that time had no reply.</p>
               <p>But this is a debate, I confeſs, not altogether neceſſary for my preſent task, only there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you may ſee ground enough for the Earl to believe the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> was ſworn to: And all that did ſwear, before the Councils Explanation, having ſworn in that ſenſe, and, for ought I know, all (except the Clergy) being by the Councils Act ſtill bound to do ſo, It was not ſtrange the Earl might be of this Opinion. And ſeeing that many of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions were alledged to ariſe hence, and the Earl being a Diſſenter, it was yet leſs ſtrange that the Earl did ſcruple; nor is it unreaſonable that his modeſt Explanation ſhould have a moſt benign acceptance.</p>
               <p>This ſecond pretence of aggravation is, <hi>That His Majeſty did not only beſtow on the Earl his Lands and Juriſdictions, fallen into His Majeſty's hands by the forfaulture of his Father, but alſo pardon him the crimes of Leaſing-making and Miſconſtruing, whereof he was found guilty by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:48501:111"/>1662. <hi>And raiſed him to the title and dignity of an Earl, and to be a member of all His Majeſty's Judicatories.</hi> All which the Earl, as he hath ever, doth ſtill moſt thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg. But ſeeing the Advocate hath no warrand to upbraid him with His Majeſty's favours, and that theſe things are now remembred with a manifeſt deſign to raiſe duſt, and blind ſtrangers, and to add a very ill thing, Ingratitude, to the heap of groundleſs ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies caſt upon him, I muſt crave leave to anſwer a little more particularly, and refute this new <hi>Tout</hi> (as the <hi>Scots</hi> Proverb is) <hi>in an old Horn.</hi> This old <hi>Leaſing making</hi> is then now brought in ſeriouſly after it hath been treated in ridicule for Eighteen years, by the very Actors who did never pretend to defend it in cold blood: And, were it not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs too much, I could name the perſons, and make them (if capable) think ſhame of their falſhood and prevarications in that point, and of their abuſing His Majeſty, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating Juſtice, but I forbear.</p>
               <p>The Advocate, in his Book of Pleadings, makes this a <hi>Stretch,</hi> and ſays, <hi>His Majeſty reſcinded it.</hi> And His Majeſty himſelf hath ſeveral times expreſt his ſenſe of the <hi>ſtretches</hi> made by ſome againſt the Earl, at that time. It is well known the Family of <hi>Argyle</hi> is both Ancient and Honourable, and hath been Loyal and Serviceable to the Crown for ſeveral Hundreds of years; but they muſt now be deſtroyed, for having done, and being able, as they ſay, to do too much, which others neither can nor will do.</p>
               <p>Neither is the Advocate ignorant that the only failing that Family hath been charged with in all that long tract of time, was a compliance of the late Marqueſs of <hi>Argyle,</hi> the Earl's Father, in the time of the late Uſurpation, by ſitting in the then Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> ſome years after all the ſtanding Forces of the Kingdom were broken, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty beyond Sea, the whole Countrey over-run, the Uſurpers univerſally acknowledged, and neither probability of reſiſtance, nor poſſibility of ſhelter left to any that were moſt willing to ſerve His Majeſty, as the Advocate himſelf hath publiſhed in his Printed Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in which he likewiſe lays out the ſpecial and extraordinary Circumſtances whereby the Marqueſs was neceſſitate to do what he did. And the compliance charged on him was ſo epidemick, that all others were pardoned for the ſame, except he alone, though none had ſuch favourable Arguments to plead, and though he pleaded the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity that ſaved others. And ſeeing he ſubmitted, and delivered up himſelf, and loſt his Life, and ſeeing, at the ſame time of the Compliance that he ſuffered for, the Earl his Son was actually ſerving and ſuffering for His Majeſty, as you find in the former part of this Letter, the Earl's Reſtitution was no leſs than He and his Family might well expect of His Majeſty's Goodneſs and Juſtice. It is true, The Earl was again accuſed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned (which may appear indeed ſtrange to ſuch as know not all particulars) upon the ſame old? Acts of <hi>Leaſing-making,</hi> and with as little ground (if poſſible) as now, and was Pardoned by His Majeſty, for which he hath often, and doth always acknowledg, that he owes to His Majeſty both his Life and Fortune: But upon this occaſion, and being baited as he is, he hopes His Majeſty will not take it ill that he ſay, That His Majeſty's Mercy was in this caſe determined by Juſtice: And for proof that His Majeſty did then know him to be innocent, Did not His Majeſty then ſay. <hi>It was impoſſible to take a Man's Life upon ſo ſmall an account?</hi> Though nevertheleſs it had been done, if His Majeſty had not interpoſed and pardoned him. Did not the Chancellor <hi>Clarendon</hi> (who was Patron to the moſt conſiderable of the Earl's purſuers) hearing of his Condemnation, <hi>Bleſs God, he lived not in a Countrey where there were ſuch Laws? (He ſhould have ſaid ſuch Judges)</hi> And I believe many more will ſay the ſame now. Did it not plainly appear, at that time, that his principal purſuers were very bitter, malicious, and unjuſt to him? For the Earl had not only ſerved His Majeſty in that troubleſome and hazardous appearance in the Hills, but he had been particularly uſeful to Earl <hi>Middletoun,</hi> then His Majeſty's Lieutenant General, and had ſtood by him, when theſe deſerted him, whom notwithſtanding he took afterwards by the hand, when he was His Majeſty's Commiſſioner in the year 1661. and then deſigned new Intereſts and new Alliances, whereof ſome did hold, and ſome never held. And then indeed it was, that he and others thought it proper for them to deſtroy the Family of <hi>Argyle,</hi> to make their own Fortunes; But it pleaſed God and His Majeſty to diſpoſe otherwiſe: Then it was that the Earl was ſo hotly purſued for his Life; having at that time no Fortune, all being in His Majeſty's hands: Then was the accuſation of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon likewiſe urged by the ſame perſons, and muſt have carried, but it was not found ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, <hi>Leaſing-making</hi> being ſufficient to take his Life; and, as it falls out, when any Game is ſtarted, and the Hounds in chaſe, all the little Curs run alongs: So the Earl wanted not then many purſuers that are now ſcarce to be heard of. And further, ſome of the parties themſelves confeſſed the particulars to the Earl afterwards, who yet now return to act their former parts, and that they had then laid down a reſolution to intrap him, <hi>per fas, aut nefas;</hi> but notwithſtanding all this ill humour and violence, all the ground they could get for a quarrel, in two years time, was one ſingle Letter, among
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:48501:111"/>many they intercepted, the occaſion and import whereof was as follows: About a Twelvemonth after the death of the late Marqueſs of <hi>Argyle,</hi> The Earl his Son being, by the loſs of his Eſtate, and burden of his Debts, brought into ſtraits, a Friend from <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> wrote to him, then at <hi>London,</hi> to do what he could for himſelf at Court, and the ſooner the better; for he needed neither expect Favour nor Juſtice from ſome in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and, if matters were delayed, his Father's whole Eſtate would be begg'd away in parcels. His Friend likewiſe complained, that the Earl did not write to inform his Friends in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and on this he inſiſted ſeveral poſt-days, which, at laſt, drew an anſwer from the Earl, that he had been to wait upon His Majeſty, and had found him both juſt and kind to him, and doubted not the effects of his Royal favour; that he was ſenſible of his loſs by delay, yet muſt proceed diſcreetly, and not preſs to give His Majeſty trouble, but muſt take His Majeſty's method, and wait his time; That he judged, much of what his Friend told him was true, but he muſt have patience: It was his misfortune that ſome took pains to make His Majeſty believe, that the Parliament was his Enemy, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to believe the King was his Enemy; and by ſuch informations he was like to be a ſufferer, but he hoped in God all ſhould be well. <hi>This blaſt muſt blow out, and will blow over: The King will ſee their tricks.</hi> And upon this Letter, ſpecially thoſe laſt words, the Earl was accuſed of <hi>Leaſing-making betwixt King and Parliament, and that he expected changes;</hi> and ſo had a great deal of the ſame ſtuff laid to his charge, as now you have heard: And if the now Regiſter will produce the Eal's principal Letter, and the Paper the Earl gave in to the Parliament, theſe two would clear all, the Caſe then, and now, as you may ſee, <hi>Mutatis Mutandis,</hi> being much the ſame, and ſome of the ſame Tools uſed. But to go on, The Earl's words in that Letter being clear and plain, <hi>viz. That he complained of others that reported Lies to the King and Parliament, but did himſelf report none to either;</hi> He acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Letter, which could never have been proven to be his; and as ſoon as he heard that it was intercepted, did render himſelf to His Majeſty before he was called for: But, which very much troubled him, had not acceſs. Yet His Majeſty was ſo gracious, that inſtead of ſending him Priſoner to <hi>Scotland</hi> with a Guard (as was much preſſed) he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him to go down on a Verbal Bail: And His Majeſty was pleaſed to ſay, <hi>That he ſaw nothing in the Earl's Letter againſt His Majeſty or the Parliament; but believed the Earl did deſign to reflect on the Earl of Middleton.</hi> The Earl came to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> a fourthnight before the day appointed by His Majeſty, and thought to have had the liberty of the City, till that day ſhould come; but was ſent to the Caſtle the next day after his arrival: Upon which he advertiſed His Majeſty of his condition, who would hardly believe they would take his Life, till it was told plainly it was deſigned, and if he died it lay at His Majeſty's door; upon which His Majeſty was graciouſly pleaſed to ſend immediately an Order to the Earl of <hi>Middleton,</hi> not to proceed to Execution againſt him: Yet the Sentence of Death was pronounced, and the Day of Execution remitted by the Parliament to the Earl of <hi>Middleton:</hi> Which he accepted of, albeit he had no particular inſtruction for it from His Majeſty, which, before a year went about, Earl <hi>Middleton</hi> found could not be juſtified by him, and ſome of the Earl's chief accuſers were declared by His Majeſty to be them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Leaſing-makers;</hi> And then the Earl, by His Majeſty's favour and goodneſs, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to a part of his Predeceſſors Eſtate and Titles, which he took as thankfully, as if a new Eſtate, and new and greater Honours had been conferred upon him. And though His Majeſty was pleaſed, at the granting of theſe Titles, to ſay, <hi>He could help them when he pleaſed;</hi> yet His Majeſty knows, that the Earl never troubled him about any ſuch matter, nor ſolicited him now theſe Eighteen years, for any Title, Office, or Imployment, (though he confeſſes he had of all ſorts) nor hath he been burthenſom to His Majeſty's Exchequer (500 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> yearly for four or five years that the Earl ſerved in the Treaſury, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that ever he touched of his Majeſty's Money) albeit few attended more, and none ſo much that lived at his diſtance. He was alſo twice at <hi>London,</hi> to kiſs His Majeſty's hand, but ſtill on his own Charges: Which things are not ſaid to leſſen His Majeſty's bounty and goodneſs, whereof the Earl ſtill retains all juſt, tender, and dutiful impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but to anſwer the Advocate, and to teach others to hold their peace, that cannot ſay ſo much.</p>
               <p>His Life is known to have been True, Honeſt, and of a piece, and all alongs he hath walked with that ſtraightneſs, that he can compare his Integrity with all that now attacque him.</p>
               <p>By all which it is apparent, That what the Advocate here pretends for an aggravation, may w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Seeing therefore the ground of the Earl's preſent accuſation, with all he either deſigned, ſaid, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> did, in this matter, was only that, when called, nay required to take the Teſt, and after leave firſt obtained from his Highneſs and Council, he did in their preſence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the giving of his Oath, declare, and propoſe to them the ſenſe wherein he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48501:112"/>to take it; That this his ſenſe neither contains, nor inſinuates, the leaſt ſlander, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, or reflection, either upon the King, the Parliament, or any Perſon whatſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; but, on the contrair, is in effect tenfold more agreeable to the words of the Teſt, and meaning of the Parliament that framed it, than the Explanation emitted by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; and was alſo moſt certainly, the firſt day, by them accepted; and, when the next day challenged, by him offered to be retracted, and refuſed to be ſigned: That the whole Indictment, and more eſpecially that part of it about the Treaſon, is a meer Rapſody of the moſt irrational, abſurd, and pernicious conſequences, that ever the Sun beheld, not only forcing the Common rules of Speech, Charity, and Humanity, but ranverſing all the Topicks of Law, Reaſon, and Religion, and threatning no leſs, in the Earl's perſon, than the ruine of every Man's Fortune, Life, and Honour; That the Earl's Defences, and grounds of Exculpation, were moſt pregnant, and unanſwerable, and either in themſelves notour, or offered to be inſtantly verified. And laſtly, That the aggravations pretended againſt him do either directly make for him, or moſt evidently diſcover the reſtleſs malice of ſome of his implacable enemies: Shall our Gracious King, who not only clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands Right, and hates Oppreſſion, but alſo, to all his other excellent qualities, hath by his Gentleneſs and Clemency, even towards his Enemies, added that great Character of Goodneſs, upon vain and falſe inſinuations, and unreaſonable and violent ſtretches, not only take away the Life of an innocent perſon, but of one who himſelf, and his Family (be it ſaid without diſparagement) have, for a longer time, and more faithfully, and ſignally ſerved His Majeſty and the Crown, than any perſon, or Family of his degree and quality, of all his Perſecutors can pretend to? Shall his numerous Family, hopeful Children, his Friends and Creditors, all be deſtroyed? Shall both former Services be forgot, Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence oppreſſed, and all Rules of Juſtice, and Laws of ſociety and humanity for his ſake overturned? Shall not only the Earl be cut off, and his noble and ancient Family ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, but his Blood and Memory tainted with as black and horrible a ſtain, as if he had conſpired with <hi>Jacques Clement, Ravillack,</hi> The Gun-powder Miſcreants, The Bloody <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels, and all the other moſt wicked and hainous Traytors of that Gang? And all this for a meer imaginary Crime, whereof it is moſt certain, that no Man living hath, or can have, the leaſt real conviction, and upon ſuch frivolous allegations as all men ſee to be, at the top, meer Moon-ſhine; and at the bottom, Villany unmixed.</p>
               <p>After clearing theſe things, the Earl, it ſeems, intended to have addreſſed himſelf to His Majeſty's Advocate in particular, and to have told him, that he had begun very time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in Parliament to fall firſt on his heritable juriſdictions, and then upon his Eſtate, and that now he was fallen upon his Life and Honour, whereby it was eaſie to divine that more was intended, from the beginning, than the ſimple taking away of his Offices: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſome of them, on his refuſing the Teſt, were taken away by the Certification of the Act of Parliament, and that thoſe that were heritable he offered, in Parliament, to preſent and ſurrender to His Majeſty on his knee, if His Majeſty, after hearing him, ſhould think it fit; only he was not willing to have them torn from him, as hath been ſaid; and if that were all were deſigned, as was at firſt given out, the Advocate need not have ſet him on high, as <hi>Naboth,</hi> and accuſe him as a Blaſphemer of God and the King.</p>
               <p>Then turning his Speech to the Lords of Juſtitiary, he thought to have deſired that they would yet ſeriouſly conſider his words, in their true ſenſe and circumſtances, his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of his Explication, and eſpecially the foregoing matter of Fact to have been laid before them, with his Defences, and grounds of Exculpation; as alſo to have told them, That they could not but obſerve how that he was ſingled out amongſt Thouſands, (againſt whom much more then all he is charged with could be alledged) and that they muſt of neceſſity acknowledg (if they would ſpeak out their own Conſcience) that what he had ſaid was ſpoke in pure innocence, and duty, and only for the exoneration of himſelf, as a Chriſtian, and one honoured to be of His Majeſty's Privy Council (where he was bound, by his Oath, to ſpeak truth freely) and not to throw the ſmalleſt reproach on either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or thing. Adding, That he was loath to ſay any thing that looks like a reflection upon His Majeſty's Privy Council; but if the Council can wrong one of their own number, he thought he might demand, If he had not met with hard meaſure? For firſt he was preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and perſuaded to come to the Council; then they receive his Explanation, and take his Oath, then they complain of him to His Majeſty, where he had no acceſs to be heard; and by their Letter, under their hands, affirm, That they had been careful not to ſuffer any to take the Teſt with their own Explanations, albeit they had allowed a thing very like it, firſt to Earl <hi>Queensberry,</hi> then to the Clergy: And the Preſident, now Chancellour, had permitted ſeveral Members of the College of Juſtice to premiſe, when they ſwear the Teſt, ſome one ſenſe, and ſome another, and ſome nonſenſe, as one ſaying he took it, <hi>in ſano ſenſu;</hi> another making a Speech that no Man underſtood; a third, all the time of the reading, repeating, <hi>Lord have mercy upon me miſerable ſinner:</hi> Nay, even an Advocate, after being debarred a few days, becauſe albeit no Clerk, yet he would not take it without
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48501:112"/>the <hi>benefit of his Clergy, viz.</hi> the <hi>Councils Explanation,</hi> was yet thereafter admitted without the <hi>Warrant of the Councils Act:</hi> but all this in the Caſe of ſo many other was right and good. Further the Council expreſly declare the Earl to be Guilty, before he had ever ſaid one word in his own defence. Thereafter ſome of them become his Aſſizers, and others of them wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt him; and after all, they do of new concern themſelves, by a Second Letter to His Majeſty (<hi>wherein they aſſert, That after full debate, and clear probation, he was found guilty of Treaſon,</hi> &amp;c.) to have a ſentence paſt againſt him, and that of ſo high a nature, and ſo dreadful a conſequence, as ſuffers no perſon to be unconcerned, far leſs their Lordſhips his Judges, who upon grounds equally juſt, and, which is more, already predetermined by themſelves, may ſoon meet with the ſame meaſure, not only as Concealers of Treaſon, but upon the leaſt pretended diſobedience, or non-compliance with any Act of Parliament: and, after all, muſt infallably render an account to God Almighty. He bids them therefore <hi>lay their hands to their bearts,</hi> and whatever they ſhall judge, he is aſſured that God knows, and he hopes all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blaſſed men in the World will, or may know, he is neither guilty of Treaſon, nor any of the Crimes libelled. He ſays he is glad how many out-do him in aſſerting the true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, and their Loyalty to His Majeſty; only, he hadds, If he could juſtify himſelf to God, as he can to His Majeſty, he is ſure he might account himſelf the happieſt man alive. But yet, ſeeing he hath a better hope in the mercy of God through Jeſus Chriſt, he thereupon reſts, whether he finds Juſtice here on Earth, or not. He ſays, he will add nothing to move them either to tenderneſs or pity; he knows that not to be the place, and pretends to neither from them; He pleads his Innocence, and craves Juſtice, leaving it to their Lordſhips to conſider not ſo much his particular Caſe, as what a Preparative it may be made, and what may be its Conſequences: And if all he hath ſaid, do neither convince, nor perſuade them to alter their judgment, yet he deſires them to conſider, whether the Caſe do not, at leaſt, deſerve to be more fully repreſented, and left to His Majecty's wiſdom and juſtice, ſeeing that if once the matter paſs upon record for Treaſon, it is undoubted, that hundreds of the beſt, and who think themſelves moſt innocent, may, by the ſame methods, fall under the like Condemnation, whenever the King's Advocate ſhall be thereto prompted.</p>
               <p>And thus you have a part of what the Earl intended to have ſaid, before pronouncing Sentence, if he had not made his Eſcape before the day: Yet ſome things I perceive by his Notes are ſtill in his own breaſt, as only proper to be ſaid to His Majeſty. I find ſeveral Quotations out of the Advocate's printed Books, that, it ſeems, he was to make ſome uſe of; but, ſeeing it would have been too great an interruption to have applied them to the places deſigned, I have ſubjoined them together, leaving them to the Advocate's own, and all mens conſideration.</p>
               <p>It was by ſome remarked, That when the Lords of Juſtitiary, after the ending of the firſt days debate, reſolved that ſame night to give judgment upon it, they ſent for the Lord <hi>Nairn,</hi> one of their number, an old and infirm man, who being alſo a Lord of the Seſſion, is ſo decayed through age, that he hath not for a conſiderable time, been allowed to take his turn, in the Outer-houſe (as they call it) where they judge leſſer Cauſes alone: But notwithſtanding both his age, and infirmity, and that he was gone to bed, he was raiſed, and brought to the Court, to conſider a Debate, a great deal whereof he had not heard, in full Court; and withal, as is informed, while the Clerk was reading ſome of it, fell of new aſleep.</p>
               <p>It was alſo remarked, that the Lords of Juſtitiary being, in all, five, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lord <hi>Nairn</hi> above-mentioned, with the Lords, <hi>Collintoun, Newtoun, Hirkhouſe,</hi> and <hi>Forret,</hi> the Libel was found relevant only by the odds of three to two, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lord <hi>Nairn</hi> aforeſaid, the Lord <hi>Newtoun,</hi> ſince made Preſident of the Seſſion, and the Lord <hi>Forret,</hi> both well enough known, againſt the Lord <hi>Collintoun,</hi> a very ingenious Gentleman, and a true old Cavalier, and the Lord <hi>Hirkhouſe,</hi> a learned and upright Judge: As for the Lord Juſtice General, who was alſo preſent, and preſided, his vote, according to the conſtitution of the Court, was not asked.</p>
               <p>But to return to my Narrative, the Earl, as I have already told you, did not think fit, for reaſons that you ſhall hear, to ſtay till His Majeſty's return came to the Council's laſt Letter, but, taking his opportunity, made his eſcape out of the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> the Twentieth of <hi>December,</hi> about eight at night, and, in a day or two after, came His Majeſty's Anſwer here ſubjoined.</p>

                  <hi>MOST dearly,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>having this day received your Letter of the</hi> 14th <hi>inſtant, giving an account, that our Advocate having been ordered by you to inſiſt in that Proceſs raiſed at our inſtance againſt the Earl of</hi> Argyle, <hi>he was, after full debate, and clear probation, found guilty of</hi> Treaſon, <hi>and</hi> Leaſing-making betwixt us, our Parliament, and our People; <hi>and the</hi> reproaching our Laws and Acts of Parliament: <hi>We have now thought fit, notwithſtanding of what was ordered by us in our Letter to you of the</hi> 15th <hi>of</hi> November <hi>laſt, hereby to authorize you to grant a Warrand to our Juſtice General, and the remanent Judges of our Juſtice Court, for proceeding to pronounce a Sentence, upon the Verdict of the Jury, againſt the ſaid Earl; nevertheleſs it is our expreſs pleaſure, and we do hereby require you, to take care, that all execution of the Sentence be ſtopped, until we ſhall think fit to declare our further pleaſure in this Affair: For doing whereof,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Which Anſwer being read in Council on the <hi>Thurſday,</hi> and the Court of Juſticiary, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its laſt Adjournment, as ſhall be told you, being to meet upon the <hi>Friday,</hi> after a little heſitation in Council whether the Court of Juſticiary could proceed to the Sentence of Forfaulture againſt the Earl, he being abſent, it was reſolved in the affirmative; And what were the grounds urged, either of heſitation or reſolution, I cannot preciſely ſay, there being nothing on record that I can learn. But that you may have a full, and ſatisfying ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, I ſhall briefly tell you what was ordinarily diſcourſed, a part whereof I alſo find in a Petition given in by the Counteſs of <hi>Argyle</hi> to the Lords of Juſtitiary, before pronouncing ſentence, but without any anſwer or effect. It was then commonly ſaid, that by the old Law, and Cuſtom, the Court of Juſtitiary could no more in the caſe of Treaſon, than of any other Crime, proceed further againſt a Perſon not compearing, and abſent, than to declare him Out-Law, and Fugitive: And that, albeit it be ſingular, in the caſe of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the Trial may go on, even to a final Sentence, though the Party be abſent, yet ſuch Trials were only proper to, and always reſerved for Parliaments: And that ſo it had been conſtantly obſerved until after the Rebellion in the Year 1666: But there being ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons notourly engaged in that Rebellion, who had eſcaped, and thereby withdrawn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from Juſtice, it was thought, that the want of a Parliament, for the time, ought not to afford them any immunity; and therefore it was reſolved by the Council, with advice of the Lords of Seſſion, that the Court of Juſtitiary ſhould ſummon, and proceed to trial, and ſentence, againſt theſe Abſents, whether they compeared or not, and ſo it was done: Only becauſe the thing was new, and indeed an innovation of the old Cuſtom, to make all ſure, in the firſt Parliament held thereafter, in the Year 1669. it was thought fit to confirm theſe Proceedings of the Juſtitiary, in that point, and alſo to make a perpetual Statute, that, in caſe of <hi>open Rebellion, and Riſing in Arms</hi> againſt the King, and Government, the Treaſon, in all time coming, might by an Order from His Majeſty's Council be tried, and the Actors proceeded againſt by the Lords of Juſtitiary, even to final ſentence, whether the Traytors compeared, or not. This being then the preſent Law, and cuſtom, it is apparent in the firſt place, that the Earl's Caſe, not being that of an <hi>open Rebellion,</hi> and <hi>Riſing in Arms,</hi> is not at all comprehended in the Act of Parliament; So that it is without queſtion, that, if in the beginning he had not entered himſelf Priſoner, but abſented himſelf, the Lords of Juſticiary could not have gone further, than, upon a citation, to have declared him <hi>Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi> But others ſaid, that the Earl having both entered himſelf Priſoner, and compeared, and after debate having been found guilty, before he made his eſcape, the caſe was much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. And whether the Court could, notwithſtanding of the Earl's intervening eſcape, yet go on to ſentence, was ſtill debatable: for it was alledged for the affirmative, that ſeeing the Earl had twice compeared, and that, after debate, the Court had given judgment, and the Aſſize returned their Verdict, ſo that had nothing remained but the pronouncing of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; it was abſurd to think that it ſhould be in the power of the Party, thus accuſed, and found guilty, by his eſcape to fruſtrate Juſtice, and withdraw himſelf from the puniſhment he deſerved. But on the other hand it was pleaded for the Earl; That firſt, It was a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Rule, <hi>That until once the Cauſe were concluded, no Sentence could be pronounced:</hi> Next that, it was a ſure Maxim in Law, that in <hi>Criminal Actions there neither is, or can be any other concluſion of the cauſe than the Parties preſence and ſilence;</hi> So that, after all that had paſt, the Earl had ſtill freedom to add what he thought fit, in his own defence, before pronouncing ſentence, and therefore the Lords of Juſticiary could no more proceed to ſentence againſt him, being eſcaped, than if he had been abſent from the beginning, the Cauſe being in both caſes equally not concluded, and the principle of Law uniformly the ſame, <hi>viz. That in Criminals</hi> (except in caſes excepted) <hi>no final ſentence can be given in abſence:</hi> For, as the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48501:113"/>Law, in caſe of abſence from the beginning, doth hold that juſt temper, as neither to ſuffer the Contumacious to go altogether unpuniſhed, nor, on the other hand, finally to condemn a party unheard. And therefore doth only declare him Fugitive, and there ſtops: So in the caſe of an Eſcape, before Sentence, where it cannot be ſaid the Party was fully heard, and the Cauſe concluded, the Law doth not diſtinguiſh, nor can the parity of Reaſon be refuſed. Admitting then that the Cauſe was ſo far advanced, againſt the Earl, that he was found guilty: Yet 1. This is but a declaring of what the Law doth as plainly preſume againſt the Party abſent from the beginning, and conſequently, of it ſelf can operate no further. 2dly, The finding of a Party guilty is no concluſion of the Cauſe. And 3dly, As it was never ſeen, nor heard, that a Party was condemned in abſence, (except in excepted Caſes) whereof the Earl's is none; ſo he having eſcaped, and the Cauſe remaining thereby unconcluded, the general rule did ſtill hold, and no ſentence could be given againſt him.</p>
               <p>It was alſo remembred, that the Dyets and days of the Juſtice Court are peremptour; and that in that caſe, even in Civil, far more in Criminal Courts and Cauſes, a Citation to hear Sentence is conſtantly required: which induced ſome to think, that at leaſt the Earl ſhould have been lawfully cited to hear Sentence, before it could be pronounced. But it is like this courſe, as confeſſing a difficulty, and occaſioning too long a delay, was therefore not made uſe of. However, upon the whole, it was the general Opinion, That ſeeing the denouncing the Earl Fugitive would have wrought much more in Law, than all that was commonly ſaid, at firſt, to be deſigned againſt him: And that his Caſe did appear every way ſo favourable, that impartial men ſtill wondered how it came to be at all queſtioned; It had been better to have ſiſted the Proceſs, with his Eſcape, and taken the ordinary courſe of Law, without making any more ſtretches.</p>
               <p>But as I have told you, when the <hi>Friday</hi> came, the Lords of Juſticiary, without any reſpect, or anſwer given to the Petition above-mentioned, given in by the Counteſs of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle</hi> to the Court for a ſtop, pronounced Sentence, firſt in the Court, and then cauſed pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the ſame, with all ſolemnity, at the <hi>Mercat-Croſs at</hi> Edinburgh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FOraſmuch as it is found by an Aſſize, That</hi> Archibald, <hi>Earl of</hi> Argyle, <hi>is guilty and culpable of the Crimes of Treaſon, Leaſing-making, and Leaſing-telling, for which he was detained within the Caſtle of</hi> Edinburgh, <hi>out of which he has now ſince the ſaid Verdict made his Eſcape: Therefore the Lords Commiſſioners of Juſticiary decern and adjudge the ſaid</hi> Archibald, <hi>Earl of</hi> Argyle, <hi>to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute to the death, demained as a Traytor, and to underly the pains of Treaſon, and other puniſhments appointed by the Laws of this Kingdom, when he ſhall be apprehended, at ſuch a time, and place, and in ſuch manner as his Majeſty in his Royal pleaſure ſhall think fit to declare and appoint: And his Name, Memory, and Honours, to be extinct: And his Arms to be riven forth, and delete out of the Books of Arms, ſwa that his Poſterity may never have place, nor be able hereafter to bruick or joyſe any Honour, Offices, Titles, or Dignities, within this Realm in time coming; and to have forfaulted, amit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and tint, all and ſundry his Lands, Tenements, annual-rents, Offices, Titles, Dignities, Tacks, Steed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Rowmes, Poſſeſſions, Goods, and Geere whatſumever pertaining to him, to our Sovereign Lord, to remain perpetually with his Highneſs in property. Which was pronounced for Doom</hi>—23 Dec. 1681.</p>
               <p>After the reading (and publſhing) whereof, The Earl's Coat of Arms, by order of the Court, was alſo torn, and ranverſed, both in the Court, and at the <hi>Mercat-Croſs.</hi> Albeit ſome thought that this was rather a part of the Execution, which His Majeſty's Letter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges, than a neceſſary Solemnity, in the Publication: and the Advocate himſelf ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 61. of his printed Criminals, That it ſhould only be practiſed in the Crime of <hi>Perduellion,</hi> but not in other Treaſons.</p>

            <div type="conclusion">
               <head>The Reaſons and Motives of the Earl's Eſcape, with the Concluſion of the whole Narrative.</head>
               <p>THE Earl's Eſcape was at firſt a great ſurpriſe, both to his Friends and Unfriends: for, as it is known that his Proceſs, in the beginning, did appear, to the leſs concerned, more like a piece of pageantry, than any reality; and even by the more concerned was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted but a politick Deſign, to take away his Offices, and leſſen his Power and Intereſt: So neither did any of his Friends fear any greater hazard, nor did moſt of his Unfriends imagine them to be more apprehenſive. Whereby it fell out, that upon report of his Eſcape, many, and ſome of his Well-wiſhers, thought he had too lightly abandoned a fair Eſtate, and the probable expectation he might have had of His Majeſty's favour: As alſo ſome, that were judged his greateſt Adverſaries, did appear very angry, as if the Earl had taken that courſe, on purpoſe to load them with the odium of a deſign againſt his life. And truly, I am apt to think, it was not only hard and uneaſie for others to believe, that a Perſon of the Earl's quality, and character, ſhould, upon ſo ſlender a pretence, be deſtroyed, both as to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48501:114"/>life, and fortune, but alſo that he himſelf was ſlow enough to receive the impreſſions neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ripen his Reſolution; and that if a few Accidents, as he ſays himſelf, happening a little before his eſcape, had not as it were opened his eyes, and brought back, and preſented to him ſeveral things paſt, in a new light, and ſo made all to operate to his final determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he had ſtayed it out to the laſt.</p>
               <p>Which that you may the better underſtand, you may here conſider the ſeveral Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, that, together with what he himſelf hath ſince told ſome Friends, apparently occurred to him in theſe his ſecond thoughts, in their following order.</p>
               <p>And firſt you have heard, in the beginning of this Narrative, what was the firſt occaſion of the Earl his declining in his Highneſs's favour: You may alſo remember, that his Majeſty's Advocate takes notice, that he debated againſt the Act enjoining the Teſt, in the Parliament: And, as I have told you, he was indeed the Perſon that ſpoke againſt excepting the King's Brothers, and Sons, from the Oath then intended for ſecuring the Proteſtant Religion, and the Subjects Loyalty, not thinking it fit to complement with a Privilege where all poſſible caution appears rather to be neceſſary: And this a Reverend Biſhop told the Earl afterwards had downright fired the kiln. What thereafter happened in Parliament, and how the Earl was always ready to have laid all his Offices at his Majeſty's feet: And how he was content, in Council, to be held a Refuſer of the Teſt, and thereby incur an intire deprivation of all publick Truſt, is above fully declared; and only here remembred, to ſhew what Reaſon the Earl had, from his firſt coming to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> in the end of <hi>October,</hi> to think that ſomething elſe was intended againſt him than the ſimple deveſting him of his Employments and Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions. And yet ſuch was his aſſurance of his Innocence, that when ordered by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to enter his Perſon in Priſon under the pain of Treaſon, he entered freely, in an Hackney Coach, without either heſitation or noiſe, as you have heard.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, The ſame day of the Earl's Commitment, the Council met, and wrote (as I have told you) their Letter to his Majeſty, above ſet down, Num. 22. Wherein they expreſly charge him with Reproaching, and depraving; but yet neither with Perjury nor Treaſon; and a few days after, the Earl wrote a Letter to his Highneſs; wherein he did endeavour to remove his Offence, in terms that, it was ſaid, at firſt had given ſatisfaction: But yet the only return the Earl had, was a Criminal Summons containing an Indictment, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Anſwer was come from His Majeſty. And then, ſo ſoon as his Majeſty's Anſwer came, there was a new Summons ſent him, with a new Indictment, adding the Crimes of Treaſon and Perjury to thoſe of Reproaching and Depraving, which were in the firſt Libel, as you have heard above; whereby you may perceive, how early the Deſign againſt the Earl began to grow, and how eaſily it took encreaſe, from the leaſt encouragement.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, When the Earl petitioned the Council for Advocates to plead for him: Albeit he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned twice, and upon clear Acts of Parliament, yet he had no better Anſwer than what you have above ſet down. And when the Earl's Petition, naming Sir <hi>George Lockhart</hi> as his ordinary Advocate, was read in Council, his Highneſs openly threatned, that in caſe Sir <hi>George</hi> ſhould undertake for the Earl, he ſhould never more plead for the King, nor him. But the Earl taking Inſtruments upon Sir <hi>George</hi> his refuſal, and giving out, that he would not anſwer a word at the Bar, ſeeing the benefit of Lawyers, according to Law, was denied him; Sir <hi>George,</hi> and other Lawyers, were allowed to aſſiſt him, but ſtill with a grudge. Likewiſe afterwards, they were queſtioned and convened before the Council, for having, at the Earl's deſire, ſigned their poſitive Opinion of the Caſe. At which time it was alſo ſaid in Council by his Highneſs, That their fault was greater than the Earl's: However, we ſee that as he was the occaſion of the anger, ſo he hath only found the ſmart of it.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly, The whole Proceſs, with the Judgment of the Lords of Juſtitiary, and Verdict of the Aſſize, whereby the Earl was found guilty, as you have ſeen (notwithſtanding of what hath ſo plainly appeared, and was ſo ſtrongly pleaded in his behalf) of Leaſing-making, Depraving, and Treaſon, Is of it ſelf a clear demonſtration, that either the higheſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was intended for ſo high a guilt; or that, at leaſt, it was no ſmall humiliation that ſome deſigned for him: It being equally againſt reaſon, and prudence, ſetting aſide the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Juſtice, to ſtrain things of this nature beyond the ends truly purpoſed, and which, in effect, are only the more to be ſuſpected, the more they are concealed.</p>
               <p n="5">5thly, The Proceſs being carried on to the Verdict of the Aſſize, and the Council being tied up by His Majeſty's Letter, <hi>before pronouncing Sentence, to ſend a particular account to His Majeſty of what the Earl ſhould be found guilty of, for His Majeſty's full information:</hi> The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil doth indeed diſpatch away a new Letter immediately, for His Majeſty's leave to proceed; but inſtead of that particular account required by His Majeſty, for his full information, all the information was ever heard of to be ſent by the Council, was what is contained in the body of the Letter, wherein they, briefly, but poſitively, affirm, <hi>That after full debate, and clear probation, he was found guilty of Treaſon.</hi> Which, all men muſt ſay, was far better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to prompt his Majeſty to a ſpeedy allowance, than to give him that particular infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the caſe which His Majeſty's Letter expreſly requires, and the Earl expected ſhould have been performed.</p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:48501:114"/>
               <p>But further, the Council was commanded to ſign this Letter, not ſimply in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry form, but by a ſpecial Command laid on every Member, and the Clerk appointed to go about and get their Subſcriptions, telling them <hi>they were Commanded;</hi> and complaining to the Duke when any ſcrupled to do it. The ſtrictneſs of which Orders is apparent enough from the very Subſcriptions, where you may not only read the names of Biſhops ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing <hi>in cauſa ſanguinis,</hi> but ſome of the Earl's Friends and Relations who wanted Courage to refuſe; And, in effect, how many of all the Members did it willingly, is hard to ſay, ſeeing generally they excuſe the deed in private.</p>
               <p n="6">6thly, About a week or two before the Trial, the Earl had notice, that at a <hi>cloſe Juncto,</hi> where were Perſons of the greateſt eminency, it was remembred by one preſent, how that <hi>Anno</hi> 1663. The Earl had been pardoned by His Majeſty, after he had been found guilty by the Earl of <hi>Middleton</hi> and that Parliament. And that then it was looked on as an Error in the Earl of <hi>Middletoun,</hi> that he had not proceeded to Execution, albeit His Majeſty had given command to the contrary, becauſe (as it was ſaid) it would have been but the ſame thing to him. <hi>But now,</hi> adds this kind Remembrancer, <hi>The caſe is much more eaſie: Now his Royal Highneſs is on the Throne: It might have coſt Earl</hi> Middletoun <hi>a frown, but now it can ſignify nothing, but will rather be commended in his Royal Highneſs, as acting freely like himſelf. The ſtop of the ſentence looks like a diſtruſt; but this will vindicate all, and ſecure all.</hi> And as the firſt part of the Story the Earl remembred well he had heard it from the ſame Perſon, <hi>An.</hi> 1664. and had reported it to the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> a little after; ſo the ſecond part being of a very well known dialect, could not but give the Earl the deeper impreſſions. It was further told the Earl, at the ſame time when the Councils Letter to obtain His Majeſty's aſſent to the pronouncing Sentence, and leaving all to diſcretion, was ſent, that it was thought fit that nothing ſhould appear but fair weather till the very cloſe. Yet was the Earl ſo confident of his own Innocence, and His Majeſty's Juſtice, that he did not doubt but His Majeſty, ſeeing the Proceſs, would at leaſt put a ſtop to the Sentence. But after the Councils Letter was gone, in ſuch terms as you have ſeen, to ſeek Liberty from His Majeſty to proceed to Sentence (without either double, or abbreviate of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs ſent with it) and no doubt ſmooth inſinuations made with it, that all deſigned was to <hi>humble the Earl,</hi> or <hi>clip his wings:</hi> And that this Letter was haſted away by a fleeing Pacquet, to prevent the Earl's Application, which it could not but do; and ſo could not but have weight, and prevail with His Majeſty, (to whom the Earl's Petition, as coming too late, was indeed never preſented) Then, and not till then, the Earl began to have new thoughts.</p>
               <p n="7">7thly, The Earl's Trial having been upon <hi>Monday</hi> and <hi>Tueſday,</hi> the 12th and 13th of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember;</hi> upon the 14th, the Councils Letter was diſpatched; and upon the 15th, the Earl intreated, by a friend, for liberty to ſpeak to his Royal Highneſs; whoſe Anſwer was, <hi>That it was not ordinary to ſpeak to criminals, except with Rogues on ſome Plot, where diſcoveries might be expected:</hi> Yet his Highneſs ſaid, he would adviſe upon it. But, upon <hi>Friday</hi> the 16th, he did refuſe it. Yet the Earl did renew his ſuit, and urged, That he had ſent a Petition to His Majeſty, which was the firſt he had ſent upon that occaſion, and that, before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn ſhould come, he was deſirous to have his Highneſs Anſwer, that he might owe ſome part of the favour he expected, to his Highneſs.</p>
               <p>But on <hi>Monday</hi> morning, the 19th, the Earl was told, he was not like to have any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; and in the afternoon, he heard that the return of the Councils Expreſs was looked for, on <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 22d. being the Council day. And further, That the Juſtice Court (which according to its cuſtom had ſat the ſame <hi>Monday,</hi> and, in courſe, ſhould have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed till <hi>Monday</hi> the 26th of <hi>December,</hi> or, becauſe of <hi>Chriſtmaſs,</hi> to the firſt <hi>Monday</hi> of <hi>January</hi>) was, for the Earl's ſake, adjourned till <hi>Friday</hi> the 23d. to the end, that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon the King's return, they might pronounce Sentence. He was moreover in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that his Royal Highneſs was heard ſay, That if the Expreſs returned not timouſly, he would take upon himſelf what was to be done. Which being general, and dark, was the more to be ſuſpected. All this, the Earl told, made him the ſame <hi>Monday</hi> late, caſt in his thoughts whether it were not fit for him to attempt an eſcape; but his doubtings were ſo many he could reſolve nothing, that night, except to put off till <hi>Wedneſday.</hi> Yet on <hi>Tueſday</hi> morning he began to think, if he did at all deſign to eſcape, he had beſt do it that ſame evening. However he was, even then, not fully reſolved, nor had he as yet ſpoke one word of it to any mortal. But about Ten of the Clock this <hi>Tueſday,</hi> his Highneſs ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute refuſal to ſuffer the Earl to ſee him, until His Majeſty's Return came, was confirmed: And about Noon the Earl heard that ſome Troops, and a Regiment of Foot were come to Town; and that the next day he was to be brought down from the Caſtle to the Common Jail (from which Criminals are ordinarily carried to Execution) and then he reſolved to make his eſcape that very Night, and yet did not conclude it throughly till five of the Clock in the Evening: At which time he gave directions about it, not thinking to eſſay it, till near Ten: But at Seven, one coming up from the City, and telling him that new Orders were privately given for further ſecuring of him; That the Caſtle Guards were
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48501:115"/>doubled, and none ſuffered to go out without ſhowing their faces, and that ſome Ladies had been already put to do it, and therefore diſſwading him to attempt any eſcape, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was impoſſible: The Earl ſaid, <hi>No, then it is full time.</hi> And ſo he made haſte, and within half an hour after, by God's bleſſing, got ſafe out, queſtioned pretty warmly by the firſt Centry, but not at all by the Main-guard; and then, after the great Gate was opened, and the lower Guard drawn out double, to make a Lane for his Company, one of the Guard who opened the Gate, took him by the Arm, and viewed him; but it pleaſed God he was not diſcerned. When he was out, he was not fully reſolved whither to go. Home he had judged ſafeſt; but he thought it might breed Miſtakes and Trouble that he deſigned not: So he reſolved to go for <hi>England,</hi> and to take the Road, That by Poſt he might be His Majeſty's firſt informer of his eſcape. But being diſappointed of Horſes that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, he found that the notice of his eſcape was got before him; and ſoon after, as he came the length of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> heard that His Majeſty had given way to pronounce Sentence againſt him, according as he had apprehended from the circumſtances and other grounds I have told you; which made him judge, it would be an undiſcreet preſumption, in that ſtate, to offer himſelf to his Majeſty, while he knew none durſt addreſs him, and ſo he rather chuſed to ſhift in the wide World, till His Majeſty might be at ſome greater freedom both to underſtand his Caſe, and apply ſuitable Remedies. His Majeſty's clear and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent underſtanding, and gracious and benign diſpoſition, do fully aſſure him, that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty doth not, in His thoughts, charge him with the leaſt Diſloyalty, and that he hath no Complacence in his ruine. But if His Majeſty do, at preſent, lye under the preſſure of ſome unlucky influences, not ſo eaſie to his Royal inclinations, the Earl, it ſeems, thinks it reaſonable to wait patiently for a better opportunity. It may indeed appear ſtrange, that Innocence and Honour oppreſſed in his Perſon, almoſt beyond a parallel, ſhould not, ere now, have conſtrained him to ſome publick Vindication; eſpecially when to the horrid Sentence given againſt him, his Adverſaries have further prevailed to cauſe His Majeſty diſpoſe, not only of his Heritable Offices and Juriſdictions (the pretended eye-ſore); but alſo upon his whole Eſtate and Fortune, with as little conſideration of the Earl's perſonal Intereſt, as if he had fallen for the blackeſt Treaſon, and moſt atrocious <hi>Perduellion.</hi> But, beſides that ſome things are of themſelves ſo abſurdly wicked, that all palliating pretences do only render them the more hateful; and the very ſimple hearing doth ſtrike with an horrour, not to be heightned by any repreſentation: Next that the Earl, being ſo aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhingly overtaken for words, as fairly and honeſtly uttered as he could poſſibly deviſe, doth, with reaſon, apprehend that there is nothing he can ſay in this matter, though with the ſereneſt mind, and in the greateſt truth and fobriety, that may not be conſtrued to flow from a deſign to lay blame where hitherto he hath been tender to give any ground of offence. I ſay (beſides theſe things) he is withal (I know) moſt firmly perſuaded, That, if ever he ſhall have the happineſs to be once heard by His Majeſty, and in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence allowed to explain a few Particulars, in Duty here omitted, His Majeſty's Juſtice and Goodneſs will quickly diſpel all the Clouds that now hang over him, and reſtore him to that favour wherein he hath ſometime reckoned himſelf very happy, and which he will ever be moſt ready to acknowledg. And therefore all that in the mean time he judged neceſſary, or would give way to, was that for preſerving the remembrance of ſo odd a Tranſaction, until a more ſeaſonable juncture, ſome Memorials ſhould be drawn, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited in ſure keeping; which being grown under my hand unto this Narrative, I thought I could not better obſerve his Order, than by tranſmitting it to your faithful cuſtody. I have carefully therein obſerved the Truth, in point of fact, avouching nothing but upon the beſt and cleareſt evidence can poſſibly be expected; nor have I, as to the manner, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenced or indulged my ſelf in any ſeverity of expreſſion, which, I thought, could be juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in ſuch a caſe, omitted, without betraying the Cauſe. Yet if you now, or any other hereafter, ſhall judge, that I do ſometime exceed, let it not be imputed to him; for as he did indeed charge me to guard againſt any more warm or vehement expreſſion, than the merit and exigence of the ſubject do indiſpenſibly require; ſo I am aſſured that he ſilently and patiently waits on the Lord, committing his way to him, and truſting in him, that he may bring it to paſs; and that <hi>He ſhall bring forth his righteouſneſs as the light, and his judgment as the noon-day.</hi>

Pag. 11. l. 7. of his <hi>Book of Criminals,</hi> having made the queſtion, <q>Whether what tends to a Crime, not perfected, doth fall under the Statue, or Law, by which that Crime to which it approaches is puniſhed: He inſtances in the Crime of Miſconſtruing His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Government, and Proceedings, or depraving his Laws, which, as he ſays, is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable by death, <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. Par. 10. Act 10. And then further moves, Whether Papers, as tending to miſconſtrue His Majeſty's Proceedings, and Government, or bearing inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which may raiſe in the people jealouſy againſt the Government, be puniſhed by that Law?</q> Which being one of the great Crimes pretended and libelled againſt the Earl, I ſhall here (omitting his Reaſons in the affirmative, which have not the leaſt ground in the Earl's Caſe, as you have heard) repreſent to you, how exactly he himſelf, and others, have acted for the Earl's overthrow, all theſe dangerous and pernicious things, from which he argues in the Negative. His words then are theſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>And that ſuch inſinuations and tendencies are not puniſhed criminally, He ſays, 1. It is the intereſt of mankind to know expreſly what they are to obey, eſpecially where ſuch great Certifications are annexed, as in Crimes. 2. The Law, having taken under its conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this guilt, has puniſhed the actual miſconſtruing, or depraving; but has not declared ſuch inſinuations or tendencies puniſhable: <hi>Et in ſtatutis caſus omiſſus habetur pro omiſſo.</hi> 3. This would infallibly tend to render all Judges Arbitrary; for tendencies and inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are in effect the product of conjecture, and Papers may ſeem innocent, or criminal, according to the zeal, or humour, as well as malice of Judges; Men being naturally prone to differ in ſuch conſequential inferences, and too apt to make conſtructions in ſuch, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the favour or malice they bear to the Perſon or Cauſe: Are not ſome men apt to conſtruct that to tend to their diſhonour, which was deſigned for their honour? and to think every thing an innovation of Law or Privilege, which checks their inclination and deſign? Whereas ſome Judges are ſo violent in their Loyalty, as to imagine the meaneſt miſtakes do tend to an oppoſition againſt Authority; and thus Zeal, Jealouſie, Malice, or Intereſt, would become Judges. 4. Men are ſo ſilly, or may be in ſuch haſte, or ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, (and the beſt are ſubject to ſuch miſtakes) as that no Man could know when he were innocent; ſimplicity might oft times become a Crime, and the fear of offending might occaſion offence, and how uncomfortably would the people live, if they knew not how to be innocent.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2dly, P. 47. l. 9. Of the ſame Book, he ſays, <q>That the eighth point of Treaſon is to impugn the Dignity and Authority of the three Eſtates; or to ſeek, and procure the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and diminution of their Power and Authority,</q> Act 103. <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 6. Now this being another of the Crimes charged upon the Earl, hear how the Advocate there under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands it. <q>But this (he adds immediately) is to be underſtood of a (N. B.) direct impugn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Authority; as if it were contended, that Parliaments were not neceſſary, or that one of the three Eſtates might be turned out.</q> Which how vaſtly different from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct, forced, and horrible inferences, in the Earl's Caſe, is plain and obvious.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, Ibid. p. 58 l. 2. After having ſaid, <q>That, according to former Laws, no ſort of Treaſon was to be purſued in abſence before the Juſtices;</q> and urging it to be reaſonable, he adds, 'Nor is it imaginable, but if it had been ſafe, it had been granted formerly. And <hi>l.</hi> 31. he ſays, <q>The Juſtices are never allowed, even by the late Act of Parliament, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſentence againſt abſents, but ſuch as are purſued for Riſing in Arms againſt the King. The true reaſon whereof, he tells us, is that the Law is not ſo inhumane as to puniſh equally preſumed and real guilt: And that it hath been often found, that men have abſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, rather out of fear of a prevailing Faction, or corrupt Witneſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of guilt:</q> Reaſons which albeit neither true nor juſt, (ſeeing that the Law puniſhes nothing, even in caſe of abſence, but either manifeſt contumacy, or Crimes fully proven: And that the only reaſon why it allows no other Crime ſave <hi>Perduellion</hi> to be proceeded againſt in abſence, is becauſe it judges no other Crime <hi>tanti</hi>) yet you ſee how this whole paſſage quadrats with the Earl's Caſe; who being neither purſued for <hi>Perduellion,</hi> nor preſent at giving Sentence, was yet ſentenced in abſence, as a moſt deſperate Traytor.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly, Ibid. p. 60. l. 24. Speaking of the Solemnities uſed in Parliament, at the pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Sentences for Treaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Pannel receives his Sentence kneeling; and that after the doom of Forfaulture pronounced againſt him, the Lyon, and his Brethren the Heraulds in their Formalities, come and tear his Coat of Arms at the Throne; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after hang up his Eſcutchion ranverſed upon the Mercat-Croſs: He adds, <q>But this, I think, ſhould only hold in the Crime of <hi>Perduellion;</hi> and then goes on to add, That the Children
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:48501:116"/>of the Delinquent are declared incapable to bruik any Office or Eſtate, is another Speciality introduced in the puniſhment of <hi>Perduellion</hi> only.</q> And yet both theſe terrible Solemnities were practiſed againſt the Earl, even by a Court of Juſtitiary, and not in Parliament; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he was not accuſed of <hi>Perduellion,</hi> nor be indeed more guilty of any Crime than all the World ſees.</p>
               <p n="5">5thly, Ibid. <hi>page</hi> 303. <hi>ult.</hi> He ſays, <q>That verbal injuries are theſe that are committed by unwarrantable expreſſions, as to call a Man a Cheat, a Woman Whore: But becauſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions may vary, according to the intention of the ſpeaker; therefore except the words can allow of no good ſenſe, as Whore or Thief, or that there be ſtrong preſumptions againſt the ſpeaker, the <hi>injuriandi animus,</hi> or deſign of injuring, as well as the injuring words, muſt be proven; and the ſpeaker will be allowed to purge his guilt by declaring his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and his declaration, without an Oath, will be ſufficient. 2dly, The purſuer ſhould libel the deſign, and prove it, except the words clearly infer it. 3dly, The purſuer is preſently to reſent the injury, and if, at firſt, the words be taken for no injury, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not afterward become ſuch.</q> Which things, being applied to the Earl's words, do evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſay, That unleſs his words could allow of no good ſenſe, or that there were ſtrong preſumptions againſt him, or that he could not purge his guilt, by declaring his intention, or that his words did clearly infer the guilt, there could be no Crime of Slandering, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching or Depraving, charged againſt him, except the <hi>injuriandi animus,</hi> as well as the words, had been both libelled, and proven. But ſo it is that his words do manifeſtly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of a good ſenſe, that there is not the leaſt preſumption of injury can be alledged againſt him; That he did moſt plainly purge himſelf of all ſuſpition of guilt, by declaring his ſound and upright intention; and that his words do not infer, either clearly, or unclearly, the ſmalleſt meaſure of guilt; and withal neither was the <hi>injuriandi animus</hi> at all proven: But on the contrary, the words at firſt were taken for no injury; ſo that they could not afterward become ſuch, as is above fully cleared: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Even the Advocate being Judge, the Earl is no Slanderer.</p>
               <p n="6">6thly, If it were neceſſary, I could further tell you ſeveral things that he alledges to be ſufficient for purging a Man of any criminal intention: As, where he ſays, <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 563. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <q>That, in matters of fact, perſons, even judicious, following the Faith of ſuch as underſtand, are to be excuſed.</q> And <hi>l.</hi> 30. <q>That, if it appear by the meanneſs of the crime (he ſhould ſay the ſmallneſs of the deed: And what can be leſs than the uttering of a few words in the manner that the Earl ſpoke them?) that there was no deſign of tranſgreſſion; And that the committer deſigned not, for ſo ſmall a matter to commit a crime (much leſs ſuch horrid ones as Depraving and Treaſon). In that caſe, the meanneſs of the tranſgreſſion (or deed) ought to defend againſt the relevancy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> But to give you one inſtance for all, how much the Advocate may, one day or other, be obliged to plead the innocence of his intentions, to free himſelf of words downright in themſelves ſlanderous and depraving an Act of Parliament, much better nor he underſtands it, and in freſh and conſtant obſervance. <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 139. towards the middle, ſpeaking of the 151 Act, <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. P. 12. Whereby it is Statute: <q>That ſeeing divers exceptions and objections riſes upon criminal Libels, and parties are fruſtrate of Juſtice by the alledged irrelevancy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. That in time coming all Criminal Libels ſhall contain, that the perſons complained on are <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Part</hi> of the Crimes Libelled; which ſhall be relevant to accuſe them thereof: ſwa that no exception, or objection take away that part of the Libel in time coming.</q> He ſays, <q>That he finds no Act of Parliament more unreaſonable; for the Statutory part of that Act, committing the Tryal of Art and Part to Aſſizers, ſeems moſt unjuſt: Seeing in committing the greateſt queſtions of the Law to the moſt ignorant of the Subjects, it puts a ſharp Sword into the hands of blind men. And the reaſon of this Act ſpecified in the Narrative, is likewiſe moſt inept, and no ways illative, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> What Reproaches! What Blaſphemies! The Earl ſaid not one word againſt any Act of Parliament: But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, That he was confident the Parliament intended no contradiction; and that he was willing to take the Teſt in the Parliaments ſenſe. But here the Advocate both ſays and Prints it, That <hi>an Act of Parliament is moſt unreaſonable, and moſt unjuſt, and it's reaſon moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ept, and that it puts a ſharp Sword in the hands of blind men.</hi> Whereof the ſmalleſt branch is infinitely more reproachful than all can be ſtrained out of the Earl's words. But, Sir, Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation is but Speculation; and if the Advocate, when his day comes, be as able to purge himſelf of Practical Depravations, as I am inclined to excuſe all his Viſionary Lapſes, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of the famous Title, <hi>Quod quiſque juris in alterum ſtatuorit ut ipſe eodem jure uta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> he ſhall never be the worſe of my cenſure.</p>

            <p>LAST <hi>Thurſday</hi> we came to Trial with my Lord Marqueſs of <hi>Antrim;</hi> but according to my Fears (which you always ſurmiſed to be in vain) he was by the King's Extraordinary and Peremptory <hi>Letter of Favour</hi> reſtored to his Eſtate, as an Innocent Papiſt. We proved Eight Qualifications in the <hi>Act of Settlement</hi> againſt him, the leaſt of which made him unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being reſtored as Innocent.</p>
            <p>We proved 1. <hi>That he was to have a hand in ſurprizing the Caſtle of</hi> Dublin, <hi>in the Year</hi> 1641.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That he was of the Rebels Party before the 15th of</hi> September, 1643. <hi>which we made appear by his hourly and frequent intercourſe with</hi> Renny O Moore, <hi>and many others; being himſelf the moſt notorious of the ſaid Rebels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That he entered into the Roman-Catholick Confederacy before the Peace in</hi> 1643.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That he conſtantly adhered to the Nuncio's Party, in oppoſition to his Majeſty's Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>That he ſate from time to time in the Supream Council of</hi> Kilkenny.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>That he ſigned that execrable Oath of Aſſociation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>That he was Commiſſionated, and acted as Lieutenant-General, from the ſaid Aſſembly at</hi> Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>That he declared by ſeveral Letters of his own penning, himſelf in Conjunction with</hi> Owen Ro Oneale, <hi>and a conſtant Oppoſer to the ſeveral Peaces, made by the Lord Lieutenant with the</hi> Iriſh.</p>
            <p>We were ſeven hours by the Clock in proving our Evidence againſt him, but at laſt the King's Letter being opened, and read in Court, <hi>Rainsford,</hi> one of the Commiſſioners, ſaid to us, <hi>That the King's Letter on his behalf was Evidence without Exception,</hi> and thereupon declared him to be an Innocent Papiſt.</p>
            <p>This Cauſe (Sir) hath (tho many Reflections hath paſſed upon the Commiſſioners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) more ſtartled the Judgments of all men, than all the Tryals ſince the beginning of their ſitting; and it is very ſtrange and wonderful to all of the Long Robe, that the King ſhould give ſuch a Letter, having diveſted himſelf of that Authority, and repoſed the Truſt in the Commiſſioners for that purpoſe: And likewiſe it is admired, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners having taken ſolemn Oaths, <hi>To execute nothing but according to, and in purſuance of the Act of Settlement,</hi> ſhould, barely upon his Majeſty's Letter, declare the Marqueſs Innocent.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort; There never was ſo great a Rebel, that had ſo much favour from ſo good a King: And it is very evident to me, though young, and ſcarce yet brought upon the ſtage, that the conſequence of theſe things will be very bad; and if God of his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary mercy do not prevent it, War, and (if poſſible greater Judgments, cannot be far from us; where Vice is Patroniz'd, and <hi>Antrim,</hi> a Rebel upon Record, and ſo lately and clearly proved one, ſhould have no other colour for his Actions but the King's own Letter; which takes all Imputations from <hi>Antrim,</hi> and lays them totally upon his own Father.</p>
            <p>Sir, I ſhall by the next, if poſſible, ſend you over one of our Briefs againſt my Lord, by ſome Friend: It's too large for a Pacquet, it being no leſs in bulk than a Book of Martyrs. I have no more at preſent, but refer you to the King's Letter, hereto annexed.</p>

            <p>RIght Truſty and well-beloved Couſins and Counſellors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We greet you well. How far we have been from interpoſing on the behalf of any of our <hi>Iriſh</hi> Subjects, who by their miſcarriages in the late Rebellion in that Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> had made themſelves unworthy of Our Grace and Protection, is notorious to all men; and We were ſo jealous in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, that ſhortly after Our return into this Our Kingdom, when the Marqueſs of <hi>Antrim</hi> came hither to preſent his duty to Us, upon the Information We received from thoſe Perſons who then attended Us, by a Deputation from Our Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or from thoſe who at that time owned our Authority there, that the Marqueſs of <hi>Antrim</hi> had ſo misbehaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf towards Us, and Our late Royal Father of bleſſed memory, that he was in no degree wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the leaſt Countenance from Us, and that they had manifeſt and unqueſtionable Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſuch his guilt. Whereupon We refuſed to admit the ſaid Marqueſs ſo much as into Our Preſence, but on the contrary, committed him Priſoner to our Tower of <hi>London,</hi> where after he had continued ſeveral Months under a ſtrict reſtraint, upon the continual Information of the ſaid Perſons, We ſent him into <hi>Ireland,</hi> without interpoſing the leaſt on his behalf, but left him to undergo ſuch a Tryal and Puniſhment, as by the Juſtice of that Our Kingdom ſhould be found due to his Crime, expecting ſtill that ſome heinous Matter would be objected
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48501:117"/>and proved againſt him, to make him uncapable, and to deprive him of that Favour and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from Us, which we knew his former Actions and Services had merited. After many months attendance there, and (We preſume) after ſuch Examinations as were requiſite, he was at laſt diſmiſſed without any Cenſure, and without any tranſmiſſion of Charge againſt him to Us, and with a Licenſe to tranſport himſelf into this Kingdom; We concluded that it was then time to give him ſome inſtance of Our Favour, and to remember the many Services he had done, and the Sufferings he had undergone, for his Affections and Fidelity to Our Royal Father, and Our ſelf, and that it was time to redeem him from thoſe Calamities, which yet do lie as heavy upon him ſince, as before Our happy Return; And thereupon We recommend him to You Our Lieutenant, that you ſhould move Our Council there, for preparing a Bill to be tranſmitted to Us, for the Re-inveſting him the ſaid Marqueſs, into the poſſeſſion of his Eſtate into that Our Kingdom, as had been done in ſome other Caſes. To which Letter, you Our ſaid Lieutenant returned us anſwer, That you had informed Our Council of that Our Letter, and that you were upon conſideration thereof, unanimouſly of Opinion, that ſuch a Bill ought not to be tranſmitted to Us, the Reaſon whereof would forthwith be preſented to Us from our Council. After which time We received the incloſed Petition from the ſaid Marqueſs, which We referred to the conſiderations and examinations of the Lords of Our Privy Council, whoſe Names are mentioned in that Our Reference, which is annexed to the ſaid Petition, who thereupon met together, and after having heard the Marqueſs of <hi>Antrim,</hi> did not think fit to make any Report to Us, till they might ſee and underſtand the Reaſons which induced you not to tranſmit the Bill We had propoſed, which Letter was not then come to Our Hands: After which time We have received your Letter of the 18th of <hi>March,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſeveral Petitions which had been preſented to you, as well from the Old Soldiers and Adventurers, as from the Lady Marchioneſs of <hi>Antrim,</hi> all which We likewiſe tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Lords Referees; Upon a ſecond Petition preſented to Us by the Lord Marqueſs, which is here likewiſe encloſed, commanding Our ſaid Referees to take the ſame into their ſerious conſideration, and to hear what the Petitioner had to offer in his own Vindication, and to report the whole matter to Us, which upon a third Petition herein likewiſe incloſed, We required them to expedite with what ſpeed they could. By which deliberate Proceedings of ours you cannot but obſerve, that no importunity, how juſt ſoever, could prevail with Us to bring Our Self to a Judgment in this Affair, without very ample Information. Our ſaid Referees, after ſeveral Meetings, and peruſal of what hath been offered to them by the ſaid Marqueſs, have reported unto Us, That they have ſeen ſeveral Letters, all of them the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of Our Royal Father to the ſaid Marqueſs,
<note place="margin">☞</note> and ſeveral Inſtructions concerning his treating and joining with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> in order to the King's Service, by reducing to their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and by drawing ſome Forces from them for the Service of <hi>Scotland.</hi> That beſides the Letters and Orders under His Majeſty's Hand, they have received ſufficient Evidence and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of ſeveral private Meſſages and Directions ſent from Our Royal Father, and from Our Royal Mother, with the privity, and with the Directions of the King Our Father, by which they are perſuaded, that whatever Intelligence, Correſpondence or Actings, the ſaid Marqueſs had with the Confederate <hi>Iriſh</hi> Catholicks, was directed or allowed by the ſaid Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Inſtructions and Directions; and that it manifeſtly appears to them, that the King Our Father was well pleaſed with what the Marqueſs did,
<note place="margin">☞</note> after he had done it, and approved the ſame.</p>
            <p>This being the true ſtate of the Marqueſs his Caſe, and there being nothing proved upon the firſt Information againſt him, nor any thing contained againſt him in your Letter of <hi>March</hi> 18. but that you were informed, he had put in his Claim before the Commiſſioners appointed for executing the <hi>Act of Settlement;</hi> and that if his Innocency be ſuch as is alledged, there is no need of tranſmitting ſuch a Bill to us as is deſired; and that if he be Nocent, it conſiſts not with the Duty which you owe to Us, to tranſmit ſuch a Bill, as if it ſhould paſs into a Law, muſt needs draw a great prejudice upon ſo many Adventurers and Soldiers, which are, as is alledged, to be therein concerned. We have conſidered of the Petition of the Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and Soldiers, which was tranſmitted to Us by you, the Equity of which conſiſts in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that they have been peaceably in poſſeſſion for the ſpace of ſeven or eight years, of thoſe Lands which were formerly the Eſtate of the Marqueſs of <hi>Antrim,</hi> and others, who were all engaged in the late <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion; and that they ſhall ſuffer very much, and be ruined, if thoſe Lands ſhould be taken from them. And We have likewiſe conſidered another Petition from ſeveral Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> near ſixty in number, directed to our Self, wherein they deſire, That the Marqueſs his Eſtate may be made liable to the payment of his juſt Debts, that ſo they may not be ruined in the favour of the preſent Poſſeſſors, who (they ſay) are but a few Citizens and Soldiers, who have disburſed very ſmall Sums thereon. Upon the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter no man can think We are leſs engaged by Our <hi>Declaration,</hi> and by the <hi>Act of Settlement,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect thoſe who are <hi>Innocent,</hi> and who have faithfully endeavoured to ſerve the <hi>Crown,</hi> how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate ſoever, than to expoſe to Juſtice thoſe who have been really and maliciouſly <hi>guilty.</hi> And therefore we cannot in Juſtice, but, upon the <hi>Petition</hi> of the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> of <hi>Antrim,</hi> and after the ſerious
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48501:117"/>and ſtrict Inquiſition into his Actions, declare unto you, That We do find him Innocent from any malice, or rebellious Purpoſe againſt the Crown; and that what he did by way of Correſpondence or Compliance with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels, was in order to the Service of Our Royal Father, and warranted by his Inſtructions, and the Truſt repoſed in him; and that the benefit thereof accrued to the Service of the Crown, and not to the particular advantage and benefit of the Marqueſs. And as we cannot in juſtice deny him this Teſtimony, ſo We require You to tranſmit Our Letter to Our Commiſſioners that they may know our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Caſe of the Lord of <hi>Antrim</hi>'s, and proceeded accordingly. And ſo we bid you heartily farewel.</p>

                  <p>And thus (ſaith my Lord <hi>Coke</hi>) you have a Statute of K. <hi>Alfred,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lord <hi>Coke</hi>'s Comment upon it.</note> as well concerning the holding of this Court of Parliament twice every year at the City of <hi>London,</hi> as to manifeſt the threefold end of this great and honourable Aſſembly of Eſtates; As,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Subject might be kept from offending; that is, that Offences might be prevented both by good and provident Laws, and by the due Execution thereof.</p>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That men might live ſafely, and in quiet.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That all men might receive Juſtice by certain Laws, and holy Judgments; that is, to the end, that Juſtice might be the better adminiſtred, that Queſtions and Defects in Laws might be by the High Court of Parliament planed, reduced to certainty and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged. And further tells us, That this Court being the moſt Supream Court of this Realm, is a part of the frame of the Common-Laws, and in ſome caſes doth proceed Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally, according to the ordinary courſe of the Common-Law,</q> as it appeareth, 39 <hi>E.</hi> 3. f. <hi>Coke Inſt. ch.</hi> 29. <hi>fol.</hi> 5. To be ſhort, of this Court it is truly ſaid, <hi>Si veteſtatem ſpecter eſt antiquiſſima, ſi dignitatem eſt honoratiſſima, ſi juriſdictionem eſt capaciſſima.</hi> If you regard Antiquity, it is the moſt Ancient; if Dignity, the moſt Honourable; if Juriſdiction, the moſt Sovereign.</p>
               <p>And where queſtion hath been made, whether this Court continued during the Heptar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, let the Records themſelves make anſwer, of which he gives divers Inſtances in the times of King <hi>Ine, Offa, Ethelbert.</hi> After the Heptarchy, King <hi>Edward</hi> Son of <hi>Alfred,</hi> King <hi>Ethelſton, Edgar, Ethelred, Edmond, Canutus.</hi> All which (he ſaith) and many more, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and publickly known; proving by divers Arguments, that there were Parliaments unto which the Knights and Burgeſſes were ſummoned, both before, in, and after the Reign of the Conqueror, till <hi>Hen.</hi> 3d's time; and for your further ſatisfaction herein, ſee 4 <hi>E.</hi> 3.25. 49 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.22, 23. 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Littl. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>Whereby we may underſtand,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Parliaments are part of the frame of the Common-Law, [which is laid in the Law and Light of Nature, right Reaſon and Scripture.]</p>
               <p n="2">2. That according to this Moral Law of Equity and Righteouſneſs, Parliaments ought frequently to meet for the common peace, ſafety and benefit of the People, and ſupport of the Government.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Parliaments have been all along eſteemed an eſſential part of the Government, as being the moſt ancient, honourable and Sovereign Court in the Nation, who are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and perpetually to ſit, for the making and aboliſhing Laws, Redreſſing of Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, and ſee to the due adminiſtration of Juſtice.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That as to the place of Meeting, it was to be at <hi>London</hi> the Capital City, the Eye and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48501:118"/>Heart of the Nation, as being not only the Regal Seat, but the principal place of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and reſidence of the chief Officers, and Courts of Juſtice, where alſo the Records are kept, as well as the principal place of Commerce and Concourſe in the Nation, and to which the People may have the beſt recourſe, and where they may find the beſt accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Antiquity of Parliaments in this Nation, which have been ſo ancient, that no Record can give any account of their Beginning; my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> thus tracing them from the <hi>Britains,</hi> through the <hi>Saxons, Danes</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> to our days.</p>
               <p>So that not to ſuffer Parliaments to ſit to anſwer the great ends for which they were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, is expreſly contrary to the Common Law, and ſo conſequently of the Law of God as well as the Law of Nature, and thereby Violence is offered to the Government it ſelf, and Infringement of the Peoples fundamental Rights and Liberties.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Secondly, What we find hereof in the Statute-Law.</head>
               <p>The Statute Laws are Acts of Parliament which are (or ought to be) only Declarato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Common Law, which as you have heard, is founded upon right Reaſon and Scripture; for we are told, that if any thing is Enacted contrary thereto, it is void and null: As <hi>Coke Inſt.</hi> l. 2. c 29. f. 15. <hi>Finch.</hi> p. 3. 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 27. <hi>Doct. and Stud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe Statures which require the frequent Meeting and Sitting of Parliaments, agreeable to the Common Law, we find to be in the time of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. viz. 4 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. &amp; <hi>ch.</hi> 14. In theſe words:</p>
               <p>'Item, <hi>It is accorded that a Pariament ſhall be holden every year once, or more often if need be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next is in the 36 of the ſame K. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Item, <hi>For the maintenance of the ſaid Articles and Statutes, and Redreſſing of divers Miſchiefs and Grievances which dayly happen, a Parliament ſhall be holden every year, as at another time was ordained by a Statute,</hi>
                  </q> viz. the aforementioned, in his 4th year. And agreeable hereto, are thoſe Statutes upon the Rolls, <hi>viz.</hi> 5 <hi>Ed.</hi> 2.—1 <hi>R.</hi> 2. No. 95.</p>
               <p>By which Statutes it appeareth, That Parliaments ought annually to meet, to ſupport the Government, and to redreſs the Grievances which may happen in the Interval of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; That being the great End propoſed in their ſaid Meetings. Now, for Parliaments to meet Annually, and not ſuffered to ſit to Anſwer the Ends, but to be Prorogued or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved before they have finiſhed their Work, would be nothing but a deluding the Law, and a ſtriking at the foundation of the Government it ſelf, and rendering Parliaments alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether uſeleſs; for it would be all one to have No Parliaments at all, as to have them turn'd off by the Prince before they have done that that they were called and intruſted to do. For by the ſame Rule whereby they may be ſo turn'd off one Seſſion, they may be three Seſſions, and ſo to threeſcore, to the breaking of the Government, and introducing Arbitrary Power. To prevent ſuch intollerable Miſchiefs and Inconveniencies, are ſuch good Laws as theſe made in this King's time, and which were ſo Sacredly obſerved in after times, That it was a Cuſtom, eſpecially in the Reigns of <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>H</hi> 5. <hi>H.</hi> 6. to have a Proclamation made in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> before the end of every Seſſion,
<note n="*" place="margin">An honeſt and a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be made every Parliament.</note> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>That all thoſe who had any matter to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Parliament, ſhould bring it in before ſuch a day, for otherwiſe the Parliament at that day ſhould Determine.</hi>
                  </q> Whereby it appears, the People were not to be eluded, nor diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by ſurprizing Prorogations and Diſſolutions, to fruſtrate and make void the great ends of Parliaments.</p>
               <p>And to this purpoſe, ſaith a late Learned Author, <q>
                     <hi>That if there was no Statute, or any thing upon record extant, concerning the Parliaments ſitting to redreſs grievances, yet that I muſt believe, that it is ſo by the fundamental Law of the Government, which muſt be lame and imperfect without it; [For, otherwiſe the Prince and his Miniſters may do what they pleaſe, and their Wills may be their Laws].</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Therefore it is provided for in the very Eſſence and Conſtitution of the Government it ſelf; and this</hi> (ſaith our Author) <hi>we may call the Common-Law, which is of as much value (if not more) than any Statute, and of which all our good Acts of Parliament and</hi> Magna-Charta <hi>it ſelf is but Delaratory; ſo that though the King is intruſted with the formal part of ſummoning and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Diſſolution of Parliaments, which is done by Writ; yet the Laws which oblige him (as well as us) have determined how, and when he ſhall do it; which is enough to ſhew, that the King's ſhare in the Soveraignty, that is in the Parliament, is cut out to him by Law, and not left at his diſpoſal.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The next Statute we ſhall mention, to inforce this fundamental Right and Privilege,
<note place="margin">25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. c. 23. Statute of Proviſors.</note> is the 25th <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>ch.</hi> 23. called the <hi>Statute of Proviſors,</hi> which was made to prevent and cut off the Incroachments of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe Uſurpations in diſpoſing of Benefices occaſioned intollerable Grievances, wherein, in the Preamble of the ſaid Statute, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed as followeth:</p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:48501:119"/>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Whereupon the Commons have prayed our ſaid Soveraign Lord the King, that ſith the Right of the Crown of</hi> England, <hi>and the Law of the ſaid Realm is ſuch, that upon the Miſchiefs and Damage which happeneth to his Realm, be ought, and is bounden of the accord of his ſaid People in his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, thereof to make Remedy and Law, in avoiding the Miſchiefs and Damage which thereof cometh; That it may pleaſe him thereupon to provide Remedy. Our Soveraign Lord the King ſeeing the Miſchiefs and Damage before-named, and having regard to the ſaid Statute made in the time of his ſaid Grand-Father, and to the Cauſes contained in the ſame, which Statute holdeth always his force, and was never defeated or annulled in any point, and by ſo much is bound by his Oath to do the ſame, to be kept as the Law of this Realm, tho that by Sufferance and Negligence it hath ſince been attempted to the contrary: And alſo having regard to the grievous Complainte made to him by his People in divers Parliaments holden heretofore, Willing to ordain Remedy for the great Damages and Miſchiefs which have happened, and dayly do happen by the ſaid Cauſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>By the aſſent of all the great Men and Commonalty of his ſaid Realm, hath Ordained and Eſtabliſhed,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In which preamble of the Statute we may obſerve, (1.) The intollerable grievance and burden which was occaſion'd by the illegal Incroachments of the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> (2.) The many Complaints the People had made, who in thoſe dark times under Popery were ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of, groaning under thoſe Burdens. (3.) The Endeavours uſed in vain by former Parliaments to Redreſs the ſame, and to bring their Laws in being, to have their Force and Effect. (4.) The acknowledgment of the King and Parliament, that the Obligation hereto was upon the King,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) From the Right of the Crown, which obliged every King to paſs good Laws. (2.) The Statute in force. (3.) The King's Oath to keep the Old, and paſs New Laws for his Peoples ſafeguard, which they ſhould tender to him. (4.) From the ſence of the People, expreſſed in their Complaints; and, (5.) From the Miſchief and Damage which would otherwiſe enſue.</p>
               <p>And therefore by the deſire and accord of his People, He paſſes this famous Law. The Preamble whereof is here recited.</p>
               <p>Another Statute to the ſame purpoſe you find 2 <hi>R.</hi> 2. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 28. <q>
                     <hi>Alſo the Commons in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament pray, That foraſmuch as Petitions and Bills preſented in Parliament by divers of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, could not heretofore have their Reſpective Anſwers; That therefore both their Petitions and Bills in this preſent Parliament, as alſo others which ſhall be preſented in any future Parliament, may have a good and gracious Anſwer, and Remedy ordained thereupon before the departing of every Parliament: And that to this purpoſe, a due Statute be enſealed</hi> [or Enacted] <hi>at this preſent Parliament, to be and remain in Force for all times to come.</hi>

(2.) That a Law might paſs in that very Parliament to rectifie that Abuſe for the future. And, (3.)

               <p>Concerning the Antiquity and Authority of this Ancient Treatiſe, called, <hi>Modus tenendi Parliamentum</hi> (ſaith my Lord <hi>Coke</hi>) whereof we make often uſe in our Inſtitutes: Certain it is, <hi>that this</hi> Modus <hi>was Rehearſed and Declared before the Conqueror at the time of his Conqueſt, and by him approved for</hi> England; <hi>and accordingly he, according to</hi> Modus, <hi>held a Parliament for</hi> England, <hi>as appears</hi> 21 E. 3. ſo 60.</p>
               <p>Whereby you clearly perceive, that theſe wholſome Laws are not only in full agreement with the Common Law, and declarative thereof, but in full accord with the Oath and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Prince, who has that great truſt by the Law, lodged with him for the good and benefit, not hurt and miſchief of the People, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Theſe Laws are very ſuitable to the Duty and Office of a Ruler, and the end for which he was inſtituted by God himſelf, who commands him to do Judgment and Juſtice to all, eſpecially to the Oppreſſed; and not to deny them any requeſt for their relief, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection or welfare, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.3. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.1, to 5.2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9.8.19.5, &amp;c <hi>Eſt.</hi> 1.13.

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> They are alſo in full Harmony with the King's Coronation Oath ſolemnly made to all his Subjects, <hi>viz. To grant, fulfill, and defend all rightful Laws which the Commons of the Realm ſhall chooſe, and to ſtrengthen and maintain them after his Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Theſe Laws are alſo in full agreement, and oneneſs with <hi>Magna Charta</hi> it ſelf, that Ancient Fundamental Law, which hath been Confirmed by at leaſt Forty Parliaments, <hi>viz. We ſhall deny, We ſhall defer to no Man Juſtice and Right,</hi> much leſs to the whole Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Kingdom, in denying or deferring to paſs ſuch neceſſary Bills which the Peoples needs call for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But to all this which hath been ſaid, it may be objected, That ſeveral of our Princes have otherwiſe practiſed, by Diſſolving, or [as laterly uſed, by] Prorogucing Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments at their pleaſures, before Grievances were Redreſſed, and Publick Bills of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Safety Paſſed, and that as a Privilege belonging to the Royal Prerogative.</p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>To which it is Anſwered, That granting they have ſo done: Firſt, It is moſt manifeſt, that deth not therefore create a right to them ſo to do; according to that known Maxim.</hi> a facto ad jus non valet Conſequentia, <hi>eſpecially, when ſuch Actions are againſt ſo many expreſs and poſitive Laws, ſuch Principles of Common Right and Juſtice, and ſo many particular Tyes and Obligations upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>es to the contrary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> But if it had been ſo, yet neither can Prerogative be pleaded to juſtify ſuch Practices, becauſe the King has no Prerogative, but what the Law gives him; and it can give none to deſtroy its ſelf, and thoſe it protects, but the contrary. <hi>Bracton,</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>pag.</hi> 487. tells us,
<note place="margin">

                  <q>
                     <hi>That although the Common Law doth allow many Prerogatives to the King, yet it doth not allow any, that He ſhall wrong, or hurt any by His Prerogative.</hi>
                  </q> Therefore 'tis well ſaid, by a late Worthy Author upon this point, <hi>That what Power or Prerogative the Kings have in Them, ought to be uſed according to the true and genuine intent of the Government; that is, for the Preſervation and Intereſt of the People. And not for the diſappointing the Councils of a Parliament, towards reforming Grievances, and making proviſion for the future Execution of the Laws; and whenever it is applied to fruſtrate thoſe ends, it is a Violation of Right, and Infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King's Coronation Oath, who is obliged to Paſs or Confirm thoſe Laws His People ſhall cluſe.</hi> And tho he had ſuch a Prerogative by Law, yet it ſhould not be ſo uſed, eſpecially in time of Eminent danger and diſtreſs. The late King in His Advice to His Majeſty that now is, in his <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nor would he have him entertain any Averſion or Diſlike of Parliaments,
<note place="margin">The Late King's advice to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty.</note> which in their right Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, with freedom and Honour, will never Injure or Diminiſh His Greatneſs, but will rather be as interchangings of Love, Loyalty and Confidence, between a Prince and His people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, ſome Flatterers and Traytors have preſumed, in defiance to their Countries Rights, to aſſert, that ſuch a boundleſs Prerogative belongs to Kings.

               <head>The Concluſion.</head>
               <p n="1">1. IF this be ſo, That by ſo great Authority (<hi>viz.</hi> ſo many Statutes in force, The ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, of the Common Law, the Eſſentials of the Government it ſelf, <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> The King's Coronation Oath, ſo many Laws of God and Man;) The Parliament ought ro ſit to Redreſs Grievances, and provide for Common Safety, eſpecially in times of Common Danger. (And that this is eminently ſo, who can doubt, that will believe the King; ſo many Parliaments, The Cloud of Witneſſes, the Publick Judicatures, their own ſenſe and experience of the manifold Miſchiefs which have been acted, and the apparent Ruine and Confuſion that impends the Nation, by the reſtleſs Attempts of a bloody In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, if ſpeedy Remedy is not applied.)</p>
               <p>Then let it be Queried, Whether the People having thus the Knife at the Throat, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Habitations Fired, and therein their Perſons fried, Invaſions and Inſurrections threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Deſtroy the King and Subjects, Church and State; and as ſo lately told us, (upon Mr. <hi>Fitz Harris</hi>'s Commitment) the preſent Deſign on Foot was to Depoſe and Kill the King; and their only remedy hoped for, under God, to give them relief Relief thus from time time, cut off, <hi>viz.</hi> Their Parliaments, who with ſo much care, coſt and pains, are Elected, ſent up, and Intruſted for their help, turned off <hi>ré infecta,</hi> and rendred ſo inſigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant by thoſe frequent Prorogations and Diſſolutions.</p>
               <p>Are they not therefore juſtified in their important Cries, in their many Humble Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to their King, Fervent Addreſſes to their Members, earneſt Claims for this their Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right here Pleaded, which the Laws of the Kingdom, conſonant to the Laws of God and Nature, has given them?</p>

               <p>If King <hi>Alfred</hi> (as <hi>Andrew Horne</hi> in his <hi>Mirror of Juſtice</hi> tells us) hanged <hi>Darling, Segnor, Cadwine, Cole,</hi> and Forty Judges more, for Judging contrary to Law; and yet all thoſe falſe Judgments were but in particular and private Caſes: What death do thoſe Men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, who offer this violence to the Law it ſelf, and all the Sacred Rights of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? If the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Thorp,</hi> in <hi>Ed.</hi> 3d's. time, for receiving the Bribery of One hundred pounds was adjudged to be Hanged as one that had made the King break his Oath to the People; How much more guilty are they of making the King break His Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Oath, that perſuade him to Act againſt all the Laws for holding Parliaments, and paſſing Laws therein, which he is ſo ſolemnly ſworn to do? And if the Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice <hi>Treſilian</hi> was Hanged, Drawn, and Quartered, for Adviſing the King to Act contrary to ſome Statutes only; What do thoſe deſerve that adviſe the King to Act not only againſt ſome, but againſt all theſe Ancient Laws and Statutes of the Realm?</p>
               <p>And if <hi>Blake,</hi> the King's Council, but for aſſiſting in the matter, and drawing up In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments by the King's Command contrary to Law, tho it is likely he might Plead the King's Order for it, yet if he was Hang'd, Drawn and Quartered, for that, What Juſtice is due to them that aſſiſt in the Total Deſtruction of all the Laws of the Nation, and as much in them lies, their King and Country too? And if <hi>

And if <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudley</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time, tho two of the King's Privy Council, were Hanged for Procuring and Executing an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment contrary to the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, and to the great vexation of the People; ſo that tho they had an Act of Parliament, of their ſide, yet that Act being againſt the known Laws of the Land, were Hang'd as Traytors for putting that Statute in Execution: Then what ſhall become of thoſe who have no ſuch Act to ſhelter themſelves under, and who ſhall Act not only contrary to, but to the Deſtruction of the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom?

               <hi>The Security of</hi> Engliſh-mens <hi>Lives; or, the Truſt, Power, and Duty of the Grand Juries of</hi> England. <hi>Explained according to the Fundamentals of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Government, and the Declarations of the ſame made in Parliament by many Statutes.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Principal Ends of all Civil Government, and of Humane Society, were the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Mens Lives, Liberties and Properties, mutual aſſiſtance and help each unto other, and proviſion for their common benefit and advantage; and where the Fundamental Laws and Conſtitution of any Government have been wiſely adapted unto thoſe Ends, ſuch Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Kingdoms have increaſed in Vertue, Proweſs, Wealth and Happineſs, whilſt others through the want of ſuch excellent Conſtitutions, or negect of preſerving them, have been a Prey to the Pride, Luſt and Cruelty of the moſt Potent; and the People have had no aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of Eſtates, Liberties or Lives, but from their Grace and Pleaſure. They have been many times forced to welter in each other's Blood in their Maſter's quarrel for Dominion, and at beſt they have ſerved like Beaſts of burthen, and by continual baſe ſubſerviency to their Maſter's Vices, have loſt all ſenſe of true Religion, Virtue and Manhood.</p>
            <p>Our Anceſtors have been famous in their Generations for Wiſdom, Piety and Courage, in forming and preſerving a Body of Laws to ſecure themſelves and their Poſterities from Slavery and Oppreſſion, and to maintain their Native Freedoms; to be ſubject only to the Laws made by their own Conſent in their general Aſſemblies, and to be put in execution chiefly by themſelves, their Officers and Aſſiſtants; to be guarded and defended from all Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Force, by their own Arms, kept in their own hands, and uſed at their own charge under their Prince's Conduct; entruſting nevertheleſs an ample Power to their Kings, and other Magiſtrates, that they may do all the good, and enjoy all the happineſs that the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Soul of man can honeſtly wiſh; and carefully providing ſuch means of correcting and puniſhing their Miniſters and Councellors, if they tranſgreſſed the Laws, that they might not dare to abuſe or oppreſs the People, or deſign againſt their freedom or welfare.</p>
            <p>This Body of Laws our Anceſtors always eſteemed the beſt Inheritance they could leave to their Poſterities, well knowing that theſe were the ſacred Fence of their Lives, Liberties and Eſtates, and an unqueſtionable Title whereby they might call what they had their own, or ſay they were their own Men: The ineſtimable value of this Inheritance moved our Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors with great reſolution bravely from Age to Age to defend it: and it now falls to our lot to preſerve it againſt the Dark Contrivances of a Popiſh Faction who would by Frauds, Sham-Plots, and Infamous Perjuries, deprive us of our Birth-rights, and turn the points of our Swords (our Laws) into our own Bowels; they have impudently ſcandalized our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments with Deſigns to overturn the Monarchy, becauſe they would have excluded a Popiſh Succeſſor, and provided <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or the Security of the Religion and Lives of all Proteſtants: They have cauſed Lords and Commoners to be for a long time kept in Priſons, and ſuborned Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to ſwear matters of Treaſon againſt them; endeavouring thereby, not only to cut off ſome who had eminently appeared in Parliament for our ancient Laws, but through them to blaſt the Repute of Parliaments themſelves, and to leſſen the Peoples Confidence in thoſe great Bulwarks of their Religion and Government.</p>
            <p>The preſent purpoſe is to ſhew, how well our Worthy Fore-fathers have provided in our Law for the ſafety of our Lives, not only againſt all attemps of open Violence, by the ſevere puniſhment of Robbers, Murtherers, and the like; but the ſecret poiſonous Arrows that fly in the dark, to deſtroy the Innocent by falſe Accuſation and Perjuries. Our Law-makers foreſaw both their dangers from the Malice, and Paſſion, that might cauſe ſome of private condition, to accuſe others falſly in the Courts of Juſtice, and the great hazards of Worthy and Eminent Mens Lives, from the Malice, Emulation, and Ill Deſigns of Corrupt Miniſters of State, or otherwiſe potent, who might commit the moſt odious of Murthers in the form and courſe of Juſtice; either by corrupting of Judges, as dependant upon them for their Honour and great Revenue, or by bribing and hiring men of depraved Principles, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Fortunes, to ſwear falſly againſt them; doubtleſs they had heard the Scriptures, and obſerved that the great men of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſought out many to ſwear Treaſon and Blaſphemy againſt Jeſus Chriſt: They had heard of <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Courtiers and Judges, who, in the Courſe and Form of Juſtice, by falſe Witneſſes, murthered <hi>Naboth, becauſe he would not ſubmit his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty to an A bitrary Power.</hi> Neither were they ignorant of the Ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtories, and the peſtilent falſe Accuſers that abounded in the Reign of ſome of thoſe Emperors, under whom the greateſt of Crimes was, to be virtuous: Therefore, as became good Legiſlators, they made as prudent Provinon, as perhaps any Country in the World enjoys, for equal and impartial Adminiſtration of Juſtice in all the concerns of the Peoples Lives; that every
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:48501:121"/>man, whether Lord or Commoner, might be in ſafety, whilſt they lived in due obedience to the Laws.</p>

Twelve whereof at leaſt muſt agree to every Indictment, or elſe 'tis no legal Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict; If 11 of 21, or of 13, ſhould agree to find a Bill of Indictment, it were no Verdict. The other Twelve, in Commoners Caſes, are called the Petit-Jury, and their number is ever Twelve; but the Jury for a Peer of the Realm may be more in number, though of like Authority. The Office and Power of theſe Juries is <hi>Judicial,</hi> they only are the Judges, from whoſe Sentence the Indicted are to expect Life or Death: upon their Integrity and Underſtanding, the Lives of all that are brought into Judgment do ultimately depend; from their Verdict there lies no Appeal, by finding Guilty or not Guilty; they do compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately reſolve both Law and Fact.</p>
            <p>As it hath been the Law, ſo it hath always been the Cuſtom and Practice of theſe Juries, upon all general Iſſues, pleaded in Caſes Civil as well as Criminal, to judge both of the Law and Fact.
<note place="margin">See the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports</hi> of the Ld Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice <hi>Vaughan,</hi> p. 150, 151.</note> So it is ſaid in the Report of the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Vaughan,</hi> in <hi>Buſhel</hi>'s Caſe, That theſe Juries determine the Law in all matters where Iſſue is joined and tried, in the Principal Caſe, whether the Iſſue be about Treſpaſs, or a Debt, or Diſſeizin in Aſſizes, or a Tort, or any ſuch like, unleſs they ſhould pleaſe to give a ſpecial Verdict, with an implicite faith in the Judgment of the Court, to which none can oblige them againſt ther wills.</p>
            <p>Theſe laſt 12 muſt be Men of equal condition with the Party indicted, and are called his Peers; therefore if it be a Peer of the Realm, they muſt be all ſuch, when indicted at the Suit of the King; and in the Caſe of Commoners, every man of the 12 muſt agree to the Verdict freely, without compulſion, fear, or menace, elſe it is no Verdict. Whether the Caſe of a Peer be harder, I will not determine. Our Anceſtors were careful, that all men of the like condition, and quality, preſumed to be ſenſible of each other's infirmity, ſhould mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally be Judges each of others lives, and alternately taſte of Subjection and Rule; every man being equally liable to be accuſed, or indicted, or perhaps to be ſuddenly judged by the Party, of whom he is at preſent Judge, if he be found innocent. Whether it be Lord or Commoner that is indicted, the Law intends (as near as may be) that his Equals that judge him, ſhould be his Companions, known to him, and he to them, or at leaſt his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, or Dwellers near about the place where the Crime is ſuppoſed to have been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to whom ſomething of the Fact muſt probably be known; and though the Lords are not appointed to be of the Neighbourhood to the indicted Lord, yet the Law ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes them to be Companions, and perſonally well known each unto other, being preſumed to be a ſmall number (as they have anciently been) and to have met yearly, or oftner in Parliament, as by Law they ought, beſides their other meetings, as the hereditary Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors of the Kings of <hi>England.</hi> If time hath altered the caſe of the Lords as to the number, indifferency, and impartiality of the Peers, it hath been, and may be worthy of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's conſideration; and the greater duty is incumbent upon Grand Juries to examine with the utmoſt diligence the Evidence againſt Peers, before they find a Bill of Indictment againſt any of them, if in truth it may put their Lives in greater danger.</p>
            <p>It is not deſigned at this time to undertake a Diſcourſe of Petit-Juries, but to conſider the Nature and Power of Grand Inqueſts; and to ſhew how much the Reputation, the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and the Lives of <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> depend upon the Conſcientious performance of their Duty.</p>
            <p>It was abſolutely neceſſary for the ſupport of the Government, and the ſafety of every Man's Life and Intereſt, that ſome ſhould be truſted to inquire after all ſuch, as by Treaſons, Felonies, or leſſer Crimes, diſturbed the peace, that they might be proſecuted, and brought to condign puniſhment; and it was no leſs needful for every man's quiet and ſafety, that the truſt of ſuch Inquiſitions ſhould be put into the hands of Perſons of underſtanding, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, indifferent, and impartial, that might ſuffer no man to be falſely accuſed, or defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; nor the Lives of any to be put in jeopardy, by the malicious Conſpiracies of greator ſmall, or the Perjuries of any profligate Wretches: For theſe neceſſary, honeſt Ends, was the inſtitution of Grand Juries.</p>
            <p>Our Anceſtors thought it not beſt to truſt this great concern of their Lives and Intereſts in the hands of any Officer of the King's, or in any Judges named by him, nor in any certain number of men during life, leſt they ſhould be awed or influenced by great men, corrupted by Bribes, Flatteries, or love of Power, or become negligent, or partial to Friends and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:48501:121"/>or purſue their own Quarrels or private Revenges; or connive at the Conſpiracies of others, and indict thereupon. But this truſt of enquiring out, and indicting all the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals in a County, is placed in men of the ſame County, more at leaſt than Twelve of the moſt honeſt, and moſt ſufficient for knowledge, and ability of Mind and Eſtate, to be from time to time at the Seſſions and Aſſizes, and all other Commiſſions of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> named and returned by the chief Sworn Officer of the County, the Sheriff, (who was alſo by expreſs Law anciently choſen annually by the People of every County) and truſted with the Execution of all Writs and Proceſſes of the Law, and with the Power of the County to ſuppreſs all Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences, unlawful Routs, Riots and Rebellions. Yet our Laws left not the Election of theſe Grand Inqueſts abſolutely to the Will of the Sheriffs, but have deſcribed in general their Qualifications, who ſhall enquire and indict either Lord or Commoner: They ought, by the old Common-law, to be Lawful Liedge-people, of ripe Age, not over aged or infirm, and of good Fame amongſt their Neighbours, free from all reaſonable ſuſpicion of any deſign for himſelf or others upon the Eſtates or Lives of any ſuſpected Criminals, or quarrel or controverſie with any of them: They ought to be indifferent and impartial, even before they are admitted to be ſworn, and of ſufficient underſtanding and Eſtate for ſo great a Truſt. The ancient Law-book, called <hi>Briton,</hi> of great Authority, ſays,
<note place="margin">See <hi>Brit.</hi> p. 9, and 10.</note> The Sheriffs Bailiffs ought to be ſworn to return ſuch as know beſt how to enquire, and diſcover all breaches of the Peace; and leſt any ſhould intrude themſelves, or be obtruded by others, they ought to be returned by the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff, without the denomination of any, except the Sheriff's Officers. And agreeable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto was the Statute of 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. in theſe words. <q>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> Becauſe of late,
<note place="margin">See 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4.</note> Inqueſts were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> of perſons named to the Juſtices, without due Return of the Sheriff, of which perſons ſome were outlawed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſome fled to fanctuary for Treaſon and Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by whom, as well many Offenders were indicted, as other lawful Liege-people of the King not guilty; by Conſpiracy, Abetment, and falſe imagination of others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> againſt the force of the Common-Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is therefore granted, for the Eaſe and Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs of the People, that the ſame Indictment, with all its Dependences, be void, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den for none for ever; and that from henceforth, no Indictment be made by any ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but by Inqueſt of the King's Liedge-people, in the manner as was uſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> returned by the Sheriffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without any denomination to the Sheriffs,
<note place="margin">See <hi>Coke</hi>'s <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtit.</hi> 3d part, fol. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the Law of <hi>England;</hi> and if any Indictment be made hereafter in any point to the contrary, the ſame be alſo void, and holden for none for ever.</q> See alſo the Statute of <hi>Weſtm.</hi> 2d cap. 38. and <hi>Articul ſuper Cortas,</hi> cap. 9.</p>
            <p>So careful have our Parliaments been, that the power of Grand Inqueſts might be placed in the hands of good and worthy men; that if one man of a Grand Inqueſt, though they be Twenty three or more, ſhould not be <hi>Liber &amp; Legalis Homo,</hi> or ſuch as the Law requires, and duly returned without denomination to the Sheriff; all the Indictments found by ſuch a Grand Jury, and the proceedings upon them, are void and null. So it was adjudged in <hi>Searlet</hi>'s Caſe.</p>
            <p>I know too well, that the Wiſdom and Care of our Anceſtors, in this Inſtitution of Grand Juries, hath not been of late conſidered as it ought; nor the Laws concerning them duly obſerved; nor have the Gentlemen, and other men of Eſtates, in the ſeveral Counties, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned how inſenſibly their Legal Power and Juriſdiction in their Grand and Petit Juries is decayed, and much of the means to preſerve their own Lives and Intereſts, taken out of their hands. 'Tis a wonder that they were not more awakened with the Attempt of the late L. Ch. <hi>K.</hi> who would have uſurped a Lordly Dictatorian power over the Grand Jury of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſetſhire,</hi> and commanded them to find a Bill of Indictment for Murther, for which they ſaw no Evidence; and upon their refuſal, he not only threatned the Jury, but aſſumed to himſelf an Arbitrary Power to fine them.</p>
            <p>Here was a bold Battery made upon the ancient Fence of our Reputations and Lives: If that Juſtice's Will had paſſed for Law, all the Gentlemen of the Grand Juries muſt have been the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> baſeſt Vaſſals to the Judges, and have been penally obliged, <hi>Jurare in Verba Magiſtri,</hi> to have ſworn to the Directions or Dictates of the Judges: But thanks be to God, the late long Parliament (though filled with Penſioners) could not bear ſuch a bold Invaſion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberty; but upon the Complaint of one Sir <hi>Hugh Windham,</hi> Foreman of the ſaid Jury, and a Member of that Parliament, the Commons brought the then Chief Juſtice to their Bar, to acknowledge his fault, whereupon the Proſecution ceaſed.</p>
            <p>The Truſt and Power of Grand Juries is, and ought to be accounted amongſt the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and of moſt concern, next to the Legiſlative. The Juſtice of the whole Kingdom, in Criminal Caſes, almoſt wholly depending upon their Ability and Integrity, in the due exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their Office; Beſides, the Concernments of all Commoners, the Honour, Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Eſtates and Lives of all the Nobility of <hi>England,</hi> are ſo far ſubmitted to their Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that they may bring them into queſtion for Treaſon, or Felony, at their Diſcretion; Their Verdict muſt be entred upon Record, againſt the greateſt Lords, and proceſs muſt le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48501:122"/>go out againſt them thereupon, to impriſon them if they can be taken, or to outlaw them, as the Statutes direct; and if any Peer of the Realm, though innocent, ſhould juſtly fear a Conſpiracy againſt his Life, and think fit to withdraw; the direction of the Statutes, in proceeding to the Outlawry, being rightly purſued, he could never reverſe the Outlawry, as the Law now ſtands, ſave by Pardon, or Act of Parliament. Hence it appears, that in caſe a Grand Jury ſhould be drawn to indict a Noble Peer unjuſtly, either by means of their own weakneſs, or partiality, or a blind ſubmiſſion to the Direction or Opinion of Judges: One ſuch failure of a Jury may occaſion the Ruine of any of the beſt or greateſt Families in <hi>England:</hi> I mention this extent of the Grand Juries Power over all the Nobility, only to ſhew their joint Intereſt and Concern with the Commons of <hi>England</hi> in this ancient Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
            <p>The Grand Juries are truſted to be the princpal means of preſerving the Peace of the whole Kingdom, by the terror of executing the Penal Laws againſt Offenders, by their Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Diligence, and Faithfulneſs in making due Inquiries after all Breaches of the Peace, and bringing every one to anſwer for his Crime, at the peril of his Life, Limb and Eſtate; that every man, who lives within the Law, may ſleep ſecurely in his own Houſe.</p>
            <p>'Tis committed to their Charge and Truſt, to take care of bringing Capital Offenders to pay their Lives to Juſtice, and leſſer Criminals to other puniſhments, according to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral demerits. The Courts, or Judges, or Commiſſioners of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> and of Goal-Delivery, are to receive only from the Grand Inqueſt, all Capital Matters whatſoever, to be put in iſſue, tried and judged before them by the Petit Juries. The whole ſtream of Juſtice in ſuch Caſes, either runs freely, or is ſtopped and diſturbed, as the Grand Inqueſts do their Duties, either faithfully and prudently, or neglect or ornit them.</p>
            <p>And as one part of their Duty is to indict Offenders, ſo another part is to protect the Innocent, in their Reputations, Lives and Intereſts, from falſe Accuſers, and malicious Conſpirators: They are to ſearch out the Truth of ſuch Informations as come before them, and to reject the Indictment if it be not ſufficiently proved; and farther, if they have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſuſpicion of Malice, or wicked Deſigns againſt any Man's Life or Eſtate by ſuch as offer a Bill of Indictment; the Laws of God, and of the Kingdom, bind them to uſe all poſſible means to diſcover the Villany; and if it appear to them (whereof they are the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Judges) to be a Conſpiracy, or malicious Combination againſt the Accuſed, they are bound by the higheſt Obligations upon Men and Chriſtians, not only to reject ſuch a Bill of Indictment, but to indict forthwith all the Conſpirators, with their Abettors and Aſſociates.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs there hath been Pride and Covetouſneſs, Malice, and deſire of Revenge in all Ages, from whence have ſprung falſe Accuſations and Conſpiracies; but no Age before us ever hatched ſuch Villanies, as our Popiſh Faction have contrived againſt our Religion, Lives and Liberties. No Hiſtory affords an Example of ſuch Forgeries, Perjuries, Subornations and Combinations of infamous Wretches, as have been lately diſcovered amongſt them, to defame Loyal, Innocent Proteſtants, and to ſhed their guiltleſs Blood in the Form and Courſe of Juſtice, and to make the King's moſt faithful Subjects appear to be the vileſt Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors unto him. In this our miſerable State, Grand Juries are our only ſecurity, inaſmuch as our Lives cannot be drawn into jeopardy, by all the malicious Crafts of the Devil, unleſs ſuch a number of our honeſt Countrymen ſhall be ſatisfied in the truth of the Accuſations. For prevention of ſuch Plotters of wickedneſs as now abound, was that Statute made in the 42 of E. 3.3.
<note place="margin">See the Stat. 42 <hi>E.</hi> 3.3.</note> in theſe words: <q>To eſchew the miſchiefs and damage done to divers of the Commons by <hi>Falſe Accuſers,</hi> which oft-times have made the Accuſations more for Revenge and ſingular Benefit, than for the profit of the King, or of his People; which accuſed Perſons, ſome have been taken, and ſometimes cauſed to come before the King's Council by Writ, and otherwiſe, upon grievous pain, againſt the Law; It is aſſented and accorded for the good Government of the Commons, That no man be put to anſwer without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment before Juſtices, or matter of Record, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the old Law of the Land, and if any thing be done to the contrary,</q> it ſhall be void in Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And (ſaith the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the 25 of <hi>E.</hi> 3.4.) <q>None ſhall be taken by Petition, or Suggeſtion made to the King, or his Council, unleſs it be by Indictment, or Preſentment of good and lawful Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the ſame Neighbourhood where ſuch deeds be done, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> That is to ſay, by a Grand Jury.</p>
            <p>All our Lives are thus by Law truſted to the Care of our Grand Inqueſts, that none may be put to anſwer for their Lives, unleſs they indict them. If a cauſleſs Indictment of any man ſhould careleſly paſs from them, his guiltleſs Blood, or what prejudice ſoever the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed ſhould thereby ſuffer, muſt reſt upon them, who by breach of their Truſt were the occaſions of it; their fault cannot be excuſed by the proſecution of an Attorney, or Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor General, or any other Accuſer, if it were in their power to be more truly informed in the Caſe. Whoſoever prevents not an Evil when he may, conſents to it.</p>
            <pb n="229" facs="tcp:48501:122"/>
            <p>Now to oblige theſe Juries to the more conſcientious care, to Indict all that ſhall appear to them Criminals, and to ſave every Innocent, if it may be, from unjuſt vexation, and danger, by Malice and Conſpiracy, our Anceſtors appointed an Oath to be impoſed upon them, whico cannot be altered, except by Act of Parliament: Therefore every Grand-Jury-Man is ſworn, as the Foreman, in the words following, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>You ſhall diligently enquire, and true Preſentment make of all ſuch Articles, matters and things as ſhall be given you in charge: And of all other matters and things as ſhall come to your own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, touching this preſent ſervice. The King's Counſel, your Fellows, and your own, you ſhall keep ſecret: You ſhall preſent no perſon for Hatred or Malice; neither ſhall you leave any one unpreſented for Favour or Affection, for Love or Gain, or any hopes thereof; but in all things you ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth, to the beſt of your knowledg; ſo help you God.</hi> The Tenor of the Oath is plain, ſaving in theſe words, <hi>All ſuch matters and things as ſhall be given you in charge:</hi> But whenſoever a general Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> is Iſſued, all Capital Offences are always the principal matters given in charge to the Grand Jury, which is enough for the preſent diſcourſe of their duty: Hence then it evidently appears, that every Grand Jury is bound to enquire diligently after the Truth of every thing, for which they ſhall Indict or Preſent any Man: They are not only bound by the Eternal Law of Loving their Neighbour, to be as tender of the Life and good Name of every Man, as of their own, and therefore to take heed to the Truth in Accuſing or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting any Man; but their expreſs Oath binds them to be diligent in their Enquiries, that is, to receive no ſuggeſtion of any Crime for Truth, without examining all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances about it, that fall within their knowledge; they ought to conſider the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, and enquire as far as they can into their Aims and Pretences in their proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; if Revenge or Gain ſhould appear to be their ends, there ought to be the greater ſuſpition of the Truth of their Accuſations; the Law intending all Indictments to be for benefit of the King and of his People, as appears by the Stat. of 42 <hi>E.</hi> 3.3. Next the Jury are bound to enquire into the matters themſelves, whereof any man is accuſed, as to the time, place, and all other circumſtances of the Fact alledged. There have been falſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers that have ſuggeſted things impoſſible; for inſtance, That Thirty Thouſand Men in Arms were kept in readineſs for an Exploit, in a ſecret place, as if they could have been hid in a Chamber, or a Cabinet. The Jury ought alſo to enquire after the Witneſſes, their condition and quality, their ſame and reputation, their means of ſubſiſtence, and the occaſion whereby the Facts, whereof they bear witneſs, came to their knowledg. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times perſons of debauched lives, and low condition, have depoſed Diſcourſes, and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Councils againſt Perſons of Honour and Virtue, ſo unlikely to come to their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, (if ſuch things had been) that their pretence of being privy to them, was a ſtrong Evidence that their whole ſtory was falſe and feigned. It is alſo agreeable unto our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Law and Practice, and of great conſequence in caſes of Treaſon or Felony, that the Jury enquire after the time, when firſt the matters depoſed came to the Witneſſes know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and whether they purſued the directions of the Law in the immediate Diſcovery and purſuit of the Traytor or Felon, by Hue and Cry, or otherwiſe, or how long they concealed the ſame; their Teſtimony being of little or no value, if they have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves partakers of the Crime by their voluntary Concealment.</p>
            <p>Neither may the Jury lawfully omit to enquire concerning the Parties Accuſed, of their Quality, Reputation, and the manner of their Converſation, with many other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; from whence they may be greatly helped to make right Inferences of the Falſhood or Truth of the Crimes whereof any Man ſhall be accuſed. The Jury ought to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of nothing whereof they can enquire, or be informed, that may in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings enable them to make a true Preſentment or Indictment of the matters before them.</p>
            <p>When a Grand Jury is ſworn to enquire diligently after all Treaſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'tis natural and neceſſary to their buſineſs, to think of whom they ſhould enquire; and 'tis plainly and eaſily reſolved, that they ought to enquire of every Man that can or will inform them; and if any kind of Treaſon be ſuggeſted to them, to have been done by any Man, or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men, their Duty is the ſame in that particular, as it was in the general; that is, to ſeek diligently to find the truth. 'Tis certainly inconſiſtent with their Oaths, to ſhut their Ears againſt any lawful Man that can tell them any thing relating unto a crime in queſtion before them: No man will believe, nor can they themſelves think that they deſire to find and preſent the truth of a fact, if they ſhall refuſe to hear any Man who ſhall pretend ſuch knowledg of it, or ſuch material Circumſtaeces, as may be uſeful to diſcover it; whether that which ſhall be ſaid by the pretenders will anſwer the Juries expectations, muſt reſt in their Judgments, when they have heard them. It ſeems therefore, from the words of the Oath, that there is no bound or limit ſet (ſave their own underſtanding or Conſcience) to reſtrain them to any number or ſort of perſons of whom they are bound to enquire;
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48501:123"/>they ought firſt and principally to enquire of one another mutually, what knowledg each of them hath of any matters in queſtion before them; the Law preſumes that ſome at leaſt of ſo many ſufficient men of a County, muſt know or have heard of all notable things done there againſt the publick peace; for that end the Juries are by the Law to be of the Neighbourhood to the place where the crimes are committed. If the parties, and the facts where of they are accuſed, be known to the Jury, or any of them, their own knowledg will ſupply the room of many Witneſſes. Next, they ought to enquire of all ſuch Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes as the Proſecutors will produce againſt the Accuſed; they are bound to examine all fully and prudently to the beſt of their skill; every Jury-man ought to ask ſuch queſtions (by the Fore-man at leaſt) as he thinks neceſſary to reſolve any doubt that may ariſe in him, either about the Fact, or the Witneſſes, or otherwiſe; if the Jury be then doubtful, they ought to receive all ſuch further Teſtimony as ſhall be offered them, and to ſend for ſuch as any of them do think able to give Teſtimony in the caſe depending.</p>
            <p>If it be asked how, or in what manner the Juries ſhall enquire; the Anſwer is ready, According to the beſt of their underſtandings. They only, not the Judges, are ſworn to ſearch diligently to find out all Treaſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> within their charge, and they muſt and ought to uſe their own diſcretion in the way and manner of their Enquiry: No directions can le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally be impoſed upon them by any Court or Judges. An honeſt Jury will thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept good Advice from Judges, as they are Aſſiſtants; but they are bound by their Oaths to preſent the Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth, to the beſt of their own, not the Judges, knowledg: Neither can they, without breach of that Oath, reſign their Conſciences, or blindly ſubmit to the dictates of others; and therefore ought to receive, or reject ſuch Advices, as they judge them good or bad.</p>
            <p>If the Jury ſuſpect a Combination of Witneſſes againſt any Man's Life, (which perhaps the Judges do not diſcern) and think it needful to examine them privately and ſeparately, the diſcretion of the Juries in ſuch a caſe, is their only beſt and lawful guide, though the example of all Ages and Countries, in examining ſuſpected Witneſſes privately and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately, may be a good direction to them.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be more plain and expreſs, than the words of the Oath are to this purpoſe. The Jurors need not ſearch the Law-Books, nor tumble over heaps of old Records for the explanation of them. Our geateſt Lawyers may from hence learn more certainly our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Law in this caſe, than from all the Books in their Studies. The Language wherein the Oath is penned, is known and underſtood by every Man, and the words in it have the ſame ſignification, as they have whereſoever elſe they are uſed. The Judges (without aſſuming to themſelves a Legiſlative Power) cannot put a new ſenſe upon them, other than according to their genuine, common meaning. They cannot Magiſterially impoſe their Opinions upon the Jury, and make them forſake the direct words of their Oath, to purſue their gloſſes. The Grand Inqueſt are bound to obſerve alike ſtrictly every part of their Oath; and to uſe all juſt and proper ways which may enable them fully to perform it; otherwiſe it were to ſay, that after men had ſworn to enquire diligently after the Truth, according to the beſt of their knowledg, they were bound to forſake all the natural and proper means which their Underſtandings ſuggeſt for the Diſcovery of it, if it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Judges.</p>
            <p>And therefore if they are jealous of a Combination of the Witneſſes, or that Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and Subornation hath been made uſe of, they cannot be reſtrained from asking all ſuch Queſtions, as may conduce to the ſifting out of the Truth, nor from examining the Witneſſes privately and ſeparately;
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fort. D. Laud. Leg. Ang.</hi> cap. 26.</note> leſt (as <hi>Forteſcue</hi> ſays) the ſaying of one ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke or inſtruct others to ſay the like.</p>
            <p>Nor are the Jury tied up to enquire only of ſuch Crimes as the Judges ſhall think fit to give them directly in charge, much leſs of ſuch Bills only as ſhall be offered to them; but their Enquiry ought to extend to <hi>All other Matters and Things which ſhall come to their Knowledg, touching the preſent Service.</hi> If they have ground to ſuſpect that any Accuſation before them proceeds from a Conſpiracy, they are obliged by their Oaths to turn the Enquiry that way, and if they find cauſe, not only to reject the Bills offered upon ſuch Teſtimonies, but to Indict ſuch Witneſſes, and all the Abettors of their Villany.</p>
            <p>They are carefully to examine what ſort of men the Witneſſes are; for 'tis a Rule in all Laws, That <hi>Turpes à Tribunalibus arcentur,</hi> Vile Perſons ought to be rejected by Courts of Juſtice. Such Witneſſes would deſtroy Juſtice inſtead of promoting it. And the Grand Jury are to take care of admitting ſuch: They may and ought (if they have no certain knowledge of them) to ask the Witneſſes themſelves of their Condition, and way of living, and all other Queſtions, which may beſt inform them what ſort of men they are. 'Tis true, it may be lawful for the Witneſſes, in many caſes, to refuſe to give anſwer to ſome demands which the Jury may make; as where it would be to accuſe themſelves of Crimes: but yet that very refuſal, or avoiding to give direct Anſwers, may be of great
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48501:123"/>uſe to the Jury, whoſe only buſineſs is to find out the Truth; and who will be in a good meaſure enabled to judge of the Credit of ſuch Witneſſes, as dare not clear themſelves of Crimes, which common Fame, or the knowledg of ſome of the Grand Inqueſt has charged them with?</p>
            <p>If the Witneſſes which come before the Grand Jury upon an Indictment for Treaſon, ſhould diſcover upon their examination, that they concealed it a long time without juſt Impediment; The preſumption of Law will be ſtrong againſt them, that no ſenſe of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty or of their duty brought them at laſt to reveal it.</p>

Law,</hi> lib. 26.3.</note> that in Caſes of Treaſon the Juries were in his days adviſed (as now they ought) to be ſo ſevere in their Enquiry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in what time the Witneſſes diſcovered the Treaſon after it came to their knowledg: That if it were not evident that they revealed it with as much expedition as was well poſſible lor them, they were not by Law to be heard as Witneſſes; It was ſcarce permitted them (ſaith he) <hi>to look back</hi> in their going; ſuch ought to be their ſpeed to make known the Treaſon. Or if in any caſe they be otherwiſe openly flagitious, though they be not le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally infamous, or if they are men of deſperate Fortunes, ſo that the temptation of want is manifeſtly ſtrong upon them, and the reſtraint of Conſcience can be ſuppoſed to be little or none at all; whatever they ſay is (at leaſt) to be heard with extraordinary caution, if not totally rejected. In <hi>Scotland</hi> ſuch a degree of Poverty, that a Witneſs cannot ſwear himſelf to be worth Ten pounds, is ſufficient to lay him aſide wholly in theſe high Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of Criminal Caſes: And in ſome other Kingdoms to be a looſe liver is an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the ſame force, againſt any produced for VVitneſſes.</p>
            <p>And for the better diſcovery of the Truth of any fact in queſtion, the Credit of the VVitneſſes, and the Value of the Teſtimonies, it is the duty of the Grand Inqueſt to be well informed concerning the Parties Indicted; of their uſual Reſidence, their Eſtates and manner of Living; their Companions and Friends with whom they are accuſtomed to Converſe; ſuch knowledg being neceſſary to make a good judgment upon moſt accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but moſt of all in Suſpitions, or Indictments of ſecret Treaſons, or Treaſonable Words where the Accuſers can be of no credit, if it be altogether incredible that ſuch things as they teſtify ſhould come to their knowledg.</p>
            <p>Sometimes the quality of the accuſed perſon may ſet him at ſuch a diſtance from the Witneſſes, that he cannot be ſuppoſed to have converſed with them familiarly, if his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Conduct has been always ſuch, that it is not credible he would truſt men ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, or meer ſtrangers to him, and ſuch as are wholly uncapable to aſſiſt in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign which they pretend to diſcover.</p>
            <p>Can the Grand Inqueſt believe ſuch Teſtimony to be of any value? Or can they avoid ſuſpecting Malice, Combination, and Subornation in ſuch a Caſe? Or can they ſhew themſelves to be juſt, and conſcientious in their Duty, if they do not ſuſpend their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict until further Enquiry, and write <hi>Ignoramus</hi> upon the Bill?</p>
            <p>It is undoubtedly Law which we find reported in <hi>Stiles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Stiles, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port 11.</note> That <hi>Though there be Witneſſes who prove the Bill, yet the Grand Inqueſt is not bound to find it, if they ſee cauſe to the contrary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to make their Enquiry more inſtrumental and advantageous to the Execution of Juſtice, they are enjoined by their Oath to keep ſecret the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Counſel, their fellows, and their own.</hi> Perhaps 'tis not ſufficiently underſtood or conſidered, what Duty is enjoined to every Man of a Grand Inqueſt by this clauſe of their Oath, being ſeldom (if ever) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to them in the general charge of the Judges at Seſſions or Aſſizes: But it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that they ſhould apprehend what Counſel of the King is truſted with them. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there is or ought to be much more of it communicated to them, than is commonly thought, and in things of the greateſt conſequence. To them ought to be committed in the ſeveral Counties where any Proſecutions are begun, the firſt Informations and Suſpitions of all Treaſons, Murders, Felonies, Conſpiracies, and other Crimes, which may ſubvert the Government, endanger, or hurt the King, or deſtroy the Lives or Eſtates of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent People, or any way diſquiet or diſturb the common Peace. Our Law intends the Counſels of the King to be continually upon the protection and ſecurity of the People, and prevention of all their miſchiefs and dangers by wicked, lawleſs, and injurious men. And in order thereunto to be adviſing how to right his wronged Subjects in general, if the publick ſafety be hazarded by Treaſons of any kind; or their Relations ſnatcht from them by Murderers, or any way deſtroyed by malicious Conſpirators in form of Law; or their Eſtates taken away by Robbery and Thieves, or the Peace broken. And for theſe ends to bring to exemplary Juſtice all offenders, to deter others from the like wickedneſs. And until theſe Counſels of the King come to the Grand Jury, he can bring no ſuch Criminals to judgment, or to anſwer to the Accuſations and Suggeſtions againſt them. Hence it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes unavoidably neceſſary to reveal to the Grand Juries all that hath been diſcovered to the King or any of his Miniſters, Judges, or Juſtices, concerning any Treaſons, or other
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:48501:124"/>Offences, whereof any Man is accuſed. And where ſuſpition hath cauſed any to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, all the grounds of their ſuſpitions ought to be opened, concerning the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals and the Acceſſories, as well before as after the fact, all the circumſtances and preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions that may induce a belief of their Guilt, and all notices whatſoever, which may enable the Jury to make a more exact and effectual Enquiry, and to preſent the whole Truth. They themſelves will not only be offenders againſt God by reaſon of their Oath, but ſubject to legal puniſhments, if they knowingly conceal any Criminals, and leave them unpreſented; and none can be innocent, who ſhall conceal from them any thing that may help and aſſiſt them in their Duty.</p>
            <p>The firſt notices of Crimes or ſuſpitions of the Criminals by whomſoever brought in, and the intentions of ſearching them out, and proſecuting them legally, are called the King's Counſel, becauſe the principal care of executing Juſtice is entruſted to him, and they are to be proſecuted at his Suit, and in his Name; and ſuch proceedings are called Pleas of the Crown. From hence may be eaſily concluded, that the King's Counſel, which by the Oath of the Grand Inqueſt is to be kept ſecret, includeth all the perſons offered to them to be Indicted, and all the matters brought in Evidence before them, all circumſtances whatſoever whereof they are informed, which may any way conduce to the diſcovery of offences; all intimations given them of Abettors and Encouragers of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Felonies, or Perjuries and Conſpiracies, or of the Receivers, Harbourers, Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Concealers of ſuch Criminals.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe the Oath which enjoins the Counſel of their Fellows, and their own, to be kept, implies that they ſhall not reveal any of their perſonal knowledg concerning Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences or Offenders; nor their intentions to Indict any Man thereupon; nor any of the Propoſals and Advices amongſt them of ways to enquire into the truth of any matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, either about the Crimes themſelves, or the Accuſers and Witneſſes, or the party accuſed, nor the debates thereupon amongſt themſelves, nor the diverſity of opinions in any caſe before them.</p>
            <p>Certainly this Duty of ſecrecy concerning the King's Counſel was impoſed upon the Grand Inqueſt with great reaſon, in order to the publick good. It was intended that they ſhould have all the advantages which the ſeveral caſes will afford, to make effectual En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries after Criminals, to offer them to Juſtice. If packs of Thieves, private Murderers, ſecret Traitors, or Conſpirators and Suborners, can get intelligence of all that is known of their Villanies, all the parties concerned may conſult together, how to hide their crimes, and prevent ſuch further enquiries as can be made after them; they may form Sham-Stories by agreement, that may have appearance of Truth to miſlead and delude the Jury in their Examination, and avoid contradicting each other; they may remove or conceal all ſuch things as might occaſion a fuller diſcovery of their Crimes, or become circumſtantial Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences againſt any of their Aſſociates, if one or more of them be known or taken, or is to be Indicted. There hath been Confederates in high Crimes, who have ſecured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Juſtice done upon ſome of their Companions, by their confident appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and denial of the Fact, having been emboldened therein from their knowledg of all the grounds of ſuſpition, and all the Witneſſes examined about them, and the matter of their Teſtimonies. 'Tis too well known what helps of diſcovering the whole Popiſh Plot were loſt, through the want of keeping ſecret the King's Counſel therein, before the matter was brought either to the Parliament, or to any Grand Inqueſt; and thereby they were diſabled for the effectual execution of their Offices, and could never ſearch into the Bowels of that dangerous Treaſon in any County. But our Law having placed this great truſt of Enquiry in the prudence and faithfulneſs of the Grand Inqueſt, was careful that they might not diſable themſelves for their own truſt, by the indiſcretion or worſer fault of any of their own number, in revealing the King's Counſel or their own.</p>
            <p>And as it was intended hereby to preſerve unto them all reaſonable helps for their bringing to light the hidden miſchiefs that might diſturb the common Peace; ſo it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to prevent the Flight of Criminals; if the Evidence againſt one that is accuſed ſhould be publickly known, whether it ſhould be ſufficient for an Indictment of him, and how far it extends to others; his Confederates and Accomplices might eaſily have notice of their danger, and take opportunity to eſcape from Juſtice.</p>
            <p>Yet the reaſon will be ſtill more manifeſt for keeping ſecret the Accuſations and the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by the Grand Inqueſt, if it be well conſidered, how uſeful and neceſſary it is for diſcovering Truth in the Examinations of Witneſſes in many, if not in moſt Caſes that may come before them; when if by this Privacy Witneſſes may be examined in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and Order, as prudence and occaſion direct; and no one of them be ſuffered to know who hath been examined before him, nor what queſtions have been asked him, nor what anſwers he hath given, it may probably be found out whether a Witneſs hath been biaſſed in his Teſtimony by Malice or Revenge, or the Fear or Favour of Men in Power, or the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48501:124"/>Love or Hopes of Lucre and Gain in preſent or future, or Promiſes of impunity for ſome enormous Crime.</p>
            <p>The ſimplicity of Truth in a Witneſs may appear by the natural plainneſs, eaſineſs, and directneſs of his Anſwers to whatſoever is propounded to him, by the equality of his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ſuitableneſs of his Anſwers to queſtions of ſeveral kinds, and perhaps to ſome that may be asked for trial ſake only of his uprightneſs in other matters. And the Falſeneſs, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, or ill Deſign of another, may be juſtly ſuſpected from his ſtudiouſneſs and difficulty in anſwering; his Artifice and cunning in what he relates, not agreeable to his way of breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and parts; his reſerved, indirect, and evaſive Replies to eaſie Queſtions; his pretences of doubtfulneſs, and want of remembring things of ſuch ſhort dates, or ſuch Notoriety, that 'tis not credible he could be ignorant or forgetful of them. In this manner the Truth may be evidenced to the ſatisfaction of the Jurors Conſciences, by the very demeanor of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in their private Examinations, inaſmuch as the greateſt certainty doth often ariſe from the careful obſervation and comparing of ſuch minute matters; of which a diſtinct account is not poſſible to be given to a Court: And for that Reaſon (among others) the Juries are made the only abſolute Judges of their Evidence.</p>
            <p>Yet further, Their private Examination may diſcover truth out of ſome diſagreement of the Witneſſes, when ſeparately interrogated, and every of the Grand Inqueſt ask them Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions for his own ſatisfaction about the matters which have come to his particular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and this freely without Awe or Controul of Judges, or diſtruſt of his own Parts, or fear to be checked for asking impertinent Queſtions.</p>
            <p>Conſpiracies againſt the Lives of the Innocent in a form of Juſtice, have been frequently detected by ſuch ſecret and ſeparate Examination of Witneſſes. The Story of <hi>Suſanna</hi> is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous; that two of their Elders and Judges of great Credit and Authority, teſtified in the open Aſſembly a malicious Invention againſt her, with all the ſolemnity uſed in capital Caſes, and Sentences of Death paſſed upon her, and was ready to be executed,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny given in the Aſſembly without ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the witneſſes, and trying the Truth by Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed no Examination, or knowledge of the Truth.</note> had not wiſe <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> cried out in her behalf: <hi>Are ye ſuch Fools, O Iſraelites, that without examination, or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth, ye have condemned a Daughter of Iſrael? Return</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>again to judgment, and put theſe two one far from another, and I will examine them:</hi> And being asked ſeparately (tho in publick, the Teſtimony having been ſo given before) concerning the place of the Fact then in queſtion, they had not agreed upon that Circumſtance, as they had upon their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and ſo their falſhood became manifeſt, one ſaying <hi>the Adultery was committed under a Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Tree,</hi> the other, <hi>it was under a Pine Tree:</hi> And upon that conviction of the falſe Witneſſes, the whole Aſſembly cried with a loud voice, and praiſed God. Theſe falſe Witneſſes were put to death as their Law required.</p>
            <p>We have alſo a late Inſtance of the uſefulneſs of private and ſeparate Examinations, in the Caſe of the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> againſt whom the Attorney-General proſecuted an Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Treaſon, the laſt <hi>Midſummer</hi> Term, before the Grand Inqueſt for <hi>Middleſex.</hi> Mrs. <hi>Fitz Herris,</hi> and <hi>Tereſa Peacock</hi> her Maid, ſwore words of Treaſon againſt him poſitively, and agreed in every point whilſt they were together: But by the prudence of the Inqueſt, being put aſunder, and the Miſtreſs asked how her Maid came to be admitted to the knowledge of ſuch Matters; ſhe had an Evaſion ready, pretending her Maid to have craftily hearkened behind a Wainſcot Door, and ſo heard the Treaſon. But the Maid not ſuſpecting what her Miſtreſs had ſaid, continued her firſt Story, that ſhe heard the Treaſon from the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> himſelf, and was as much truſted by him as her Miſtreſs: By this Circumſtance the Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Perjury (which Mrs. <hi>Fitz Harris</hi> hath ſince acknowledged) was diſcovered, and the Snare for the Life of the injured Lord was broken, as is manifeſt by his liberty now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Law.</p>
            <p>Witneſſes may come prepared, and tell plauſible Stories in open Court, if they know from the Proſecutor to what they muſt anſwer; and have agreed and acquainted each other with the Tales they will tell; and have reſolved to be careful, that all their Anſwers to croſs Interrogatories, may be conformable to their firſt Stories: And if theſe relate only to Words ſpoken at ſeveral times in private to diſtinct Witneſſes, in ſuch a caſe, Evidence, if given in open Court, may ſeem to be very ſtrong againſt the Perſon accuſed, though there be nothing of truth in it. But if ſuch Witneſſes were privately and ſeparately examined by the Grand Inqueſt, as the Law requires, and were to anſwer only ſuch Queſtions as they thought fit; and in ſuch order as was beſt in their Judgments, and moſt natural to find out the Truth of the Accuſation, ſo that the Witneſſes could not gueſs what they ſhould be asked firſt, or laſt, nor one conjecture what the other had ſaid, (which they are certain of when they know beforehand what the Proſecutor will ask in Court of every of them, and what they have reſolved to anſwer) if the Inqueſt ſhould put them out of their Road, and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare all their ſeveral Anſwers together, they might poſſibly diſcern marks enough of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, to ſhew that their Teſtimonies ought not to be depended upon, where Life is in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
            <pb n="234" facs="tcp:48501:125"/>
            <p>By what is now ſaid, the reaſonableneſs of this Inſtitution of Secrecy may be diſcerned in reſpect to the diſcovery of Truth, and the protection of the Innocent from malicious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations and Perjuries. Yet the ſame Secrecy of the King's Counſel is no leſs neceſſary to reſerve the guilty for puniſhment; when the Evidence againſt any party accuſed is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and full, it may be kept without prejudice under Secrecy until further enquiry; and if ſufficient proof can afterwards be made of the Offence, an Indictment may be found by a Grand Inqueſt, and the Party brought to anſwer it: But when the Examinations are in open Court, or the King's Council any other way divulged, and the Evidence is weak, and leſs than the Law requires, 'tis not probable that it will be more or ſtronger; and ſhould an Indictment be found, and the Party tried by a Petit Jury, whilſt the Evidence is not full, they muſt and ought to acquit him, and then the further proſecution for the ſame Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is for ever barred, though his guilt ſhould afterwards be manifeſt, and confeſſed by himſelf.</p>
            <p>From hence may certainly be concluded, That Secrecy in the Examinations and Enquiries of Grand Juries is in all reſpects for the Intereſt and advantage of the King. If he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to have ſecret Treaſon, Felonies, and all other Enormities brought to light, and that none of the Offenders ſhould eſcape Juſtice; if the gain of their Forfeitures be thought his Intereſt (which God forbid) then the firſt notices of all dangerous Crimes, and wicked Confederacies ought to be ſecretly and prudently purſued and ſearcht into by the Grand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt: the Accuſers and Witneſſes ought not to publiſh in a Court before a multitude what they pretend to know in ſuch Caſes, until the diſcretion of ſo many honeſt Men of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, hath firſt determined whether their Teſtimony will amount to ſo good and full Evidence, that it may be made publick with ſafety to the King and People in order to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. Elſe they are obliged by Oath to lock up in their own Breaſts all the Circumſtances and Preſumptions of Crimes, until they, or ſuch as ſhall ſucceed in the ſame Truſt, ſhall have diſcovered (as they believe) Evidence enough to convict the Accuſed, and then, and not before, they are to accuſe the Party upon Record, by finding the Bills, (as it's uſually called.) But when Bills are offered without ſatisfactory Evidence, and they neither know, nor can learn any more, they ought for the King's ſake to indorſe <hi>Ignoramus</hi> upon them, leſt his Honour and Juſtice be ſtained by cauſing or permitting ſuch Proſecution of his People in his own name, and at his Suit, as ſhall appear upon their Tryal and Acquittal to have been frivolous, or elſe malicious deſigns upon their Lives and Fortunes.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be ſaid, That whatſoever Reaſons there are for this Oath of Secrecy; yet it cannot deprive the King of the benefit of having the Evidence made publick, if he deſires it; and that the Grand Jury do not break their Oaths, when the King, or the Proſecutor for him, will have it ſo: 'Tis not hard to ſhew, that ſuch Notions have no foundation in Law or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſeem to come from Men who have not well ſtudied the firſt Principles of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, or of True Religion.</p>
            <p>Whoſoever hath learnt that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> were ordained for the good Government of the Kingdom in the Execution of the Laws, muſt needs know, that the King cannot lawfully ſeek any other benefit in judicial proceedings, than that common Right and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice be done to the People according to their Laws and Cuſtoms. Their Safety and Proſperity are to be the Objects of his continual Care and Study, that being the higheſt concern. The Greatneſs and Honour of a Prince conſiſts in the Virtue, Multitude, Wealth and Proweſs of his People; and his greateſt Glory is, by the excellency of his Government ſo to have encouraged Virtue and Piety, that few or no Criminals are to be found in his Dominions. Thoſe who have made this their principal aim, have in ſome places ſo well ſucceeded, as to introduce ſuch a Diſcipline and rectitude of Manners, as rendred every man a Law unto himſelf.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gar.</hi> de la Veg Hiſt. de los Incas.</note> As it is reported in the Hiſtory of <hi>Peru,</hi> that though the Laws were ſo ſevere as to make very ſmall Crimes capital, yet it often fell out, that not one man was put to death in a year, within the whole compaſs of that vaſt Empire.</p>
            <p>The King's only benefit in finding out and puniſhing Offenders by Courts of Juſtice, are the preſervation and ſupport of the Government, the protection of the Innocent, reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their wrongs, and preventing further miſchiefs by the terrors of exemplary Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>The King is the head of Juſtice in the eſteem of our Laws, and the whole Kingdom is to expect right to be done them in his ſeveral Courts inſtituted by Law for that purpoſe. Therefore Writs iſſue out in his name in all caſes where relief is ſought by the Subject: and the wrongs done to the Lives or Limbs of the People, are ſaid to be done againſt the Peace of the King, his Crown and Dignity; reckoning it a diſhonour to him and his Government, that Subjects ſhould not, whilſt they live within the Law, enjoy Peace and Security. It ought to be taken for a ſcandal upon the King, when he is repreſented in a Court of Juſtice as if he were partially concerned, or rather inclined to deſire, that a Party accuſed ſhould be found guilty, than that he ſhould be declared innocent, if he be ſo in truth. Doubtleſs the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48501:125"/>King ought to wiſh in all Enquiries made after Treaſon, Felonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that there were none to be found in his Kingdom; and that whoſoever is accuſed, might be able to anſwer ſo well and truly for himſelf, as to ſhew the Accuſation to be erroneous or falſe, and to be acquitted of it. Something of this appears in the common Cuſtom of <hi>England,</hi> that the Clerks of the King's Courts of Juſtice, when any man hath pleaded Not guilty to an Indictment, prays forthwith that God would ſend him a good deliverance.</p>
            <p>The deſtruction of every Criminal is a loſs to a Prince, and ought to be grievous to him, in the common regard of humanity, and the more particular Relation of his Office, and the name of Father. The King's Intereſt and Honour is more concerned in the protection of the Innocent, than in the puniſhment of the Guilty. This Maxime can never run them into exceſſes; for it hath ever been lookt upon as a mark of great Wiſdom and Vertue in ſome Princes and States, upon ſeveral occaſions to deſtroy all Evidences againſt Delinquents; and nothing is more uſual than to compoſe the moſt dangerous Diſtempers of Nations by Acts of general Amneſty, which were utterly unjuſt, if it were as great a Crime to ſuffer the Guilty to eſcape, as to deſtroy the Innocent. We do not only find thoſe Princes repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in Hiſtory under odious Characters, who have baſely murthered the Innocent, but ſuch as by their Spies and Informers were too inquiſitive after the Guilty; whereas none was ever blamed for Clemency, or for being too gentle Interpreters of the Laws. Tho <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi> was an excellent Prince, endowed with all heroical Virtues; yet the moſt Eloquent Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and his beſt Friends, found nothing more to be praiſed in his Government,
<note place="margin">

But if the puniſhment of Offenders were as univerſally neceſſary as the protection of the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, he were as much to be abhorred as <hi>Nero;</hi> and that Clemency which is ſo highly praiſed, were to be lookt upon as the worſt of Vices; and thoſe who have hitherto been taken for the beſt of Princes, were altogether as deteſtable as the worſt.</p>
            <p>Moreover all humane Laws were ordained for the preſervation of the Innocent, and for their ſakes only are puniſhments inflicted; that thoſe of our own Country do ſolely regard this, was well underſtood by <hi>Forteſcue,</hi> who ſaith,

Such Blood hath cried to Heaven for Vengeance againſt Families and Kingdoms, and their utter deſtruction hath enſued. If a Criminal build be acquitted by too great lenity, caution, or otherwiſe, he may be reſerved for future Juſtice from Man or God, if be doth not repent; but 'tis impoſſible that ſatisfaction or reparation ſhould be made for innocent Bloodſhed in the forms of Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Without all queſtion, the King's only juſt Intereſt in the Evidence given againſt the Party accuſed, and in the manner of taking it, is to have the truth made manifeſt, that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice may thereupon be done impartially: And if Accuſations may be firſt examined in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret more ſtrictly and exactly, to prevent Fraud and Perjury, than is poſſible to be done in open Court, (as hath before appeared) then 'tis for the King's benefit to have it ſo. And nothing done in, or by a Court, about the Trial of the Accuſed, is for the King, (in the ſenſe of our Law) unleſs it ſome way conduce to Juſtice in the caſe. The Witneſſes which the Proſecutor brings, are no further for the King, than they tell the truth, and the whole truth impartially: and by whomſoever any others may be called, upon the Enquiry, or the Trial to be examined, if they ſincerely deliver the truth of the matters in queſtion, they are therein the King's Witneſſes, though the Accuſed be acquitted by reaſon of their Teſtimonies. If ſuch as are offered by the Attorny-General to prove Treaſon againſt any man, ſhall be found to ſwear falſly, maliciouſly, or for Reward or Promiſes, though they depoſe poſitively Facts of Treaſon againſt the Accuſed, yet they are truly and properly Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt the King, by endeavouring to prevent Juſtice, and deſtroy his Subjects: Their Malice and Villany being confeſſed or proved, the King's Attorney ought <hi>(ex Officio)</hi> to proſecute them in the King's Name, and at his Suit, for their Offences againſt him in ſuch Depoſitions pretended to have been for him: and the legal Form of the Indictment ought to be for their ſwearing falſly and maliciouſly againſt the Peace of the King, his Crown and Dignity. The Proſecutors themſelves, notwithſtanding their big words, and aſſuming to themſelves to be for the King, if their Proſecution ſhall be proved to be malicious, or by Conſpiracy againſt the Life or Fortune of the Accuſed, they are therein againſt the King, and ought to be indicted at the King's Suit, for ſuch Proſecutions done againſt His Crown and Dignity. And if an Attorney-General ſhould be found knowingly guilty of abetting ſuch a Conſpiracy, his Office could not excuſe or legally exempt him from ſuffering the villanous Judgment to the deſtruction of him and his Family. 'Tis eſteemed in the Law one of the moſt odious Offences againſt the King, to attempt in his Name to deſtroy the Innocent, for whoſe Protection he himſelf was ordained. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had the true ſenſe of our Law,

Whoever is truſted in that employment, diſhonours his Maſter and Office, if he gives occaſion to the Subjects to believe that his Maſter ſeeks other profits or Advantages by Accuſations, than the common Peace and Welfare: He ought not to excite a jealouſie in any of their minds, that confiſcations of Eſtates are deſigned or deſired by any of the King's Miniſters; whoſoever makes ſuch advantages to the Crown, their principal aim in accuſing, are either Robbers and Murtherers, (in the Scripture-ſenſe) in ſeeking innocent Blood for gain; or in the mildeſt Conſtruction, (ſuppoſing the Accuſation to be on good grounds) they ſhew themſelves to be of corrupt minds, and a ſcandal to their Maſter, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Profit or loſs of that kind ought to have no place in judicial proceedings againſt ſuſpected Criminals, but truth is only to be regarded; and for this reaſon the Judgments given in Court of humane Inſtitution, are in Scripture called, the Judgments of God, who is the God of truth.</p>
            <p>Yet further, If any benefit to the King could be imagined by making the Evidence to the Grand Jury publick, it could not come in competition with the Law expreſſed in their Oath; which by conſtant uninterrupted uſage, for ſo many Ages, hath obtained the force of Law. <hi>Bracton</hi> and <hi>Britton</hi> in their ſeveral Generations bear witneſs, that it was then practiſed; and greater proof of it needs not be ſought, than the Diſputes that appear by the Law-Books to have been amongſt the ancient Lawyers, whether it was Treaſon or Felony for a Grand-Jury to diſcover, either who was indicted, or what Evidence was given them. The Truſt of the Grand Juries was thought ſo ſacred in thoſe Ages, and their ſecrecy of ſo great concern to the Kingdom, that whoſoever ſhould break their Oath therein, was by all thought worthy to die;
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Co.</hi> Inſtit. 3d part, p. 107. <hi>Rulls</hi> Indic. 771.</note> only ſome would have had them ſuffer as Traytors, others as Felons. And at this day it is held to be a high Miſpriſion, puniſhable by Fine and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhment. The Law then having appointed the Evidence to be given to Grand Juries in ſecret, the King cannot deſire to have it made publick. He can do no wrong, ſaith the old Maxime, that is, He can do nothing againſt the Law; nor is any thing to be judged for his benefit that is not warranted by Law: His Will, Commands, and Deſires, are therein no otherwiſe to be known. He cannot change the legal Method or manner of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring by Juries, nor vary in any particular caſe from the cuſtomary and general forms of judicial proceedings; he can neither abridge nor enlarge the power of Juries, no more than he can leſſen the legal Power of the Sheriffs or Judges, or by ſpecial Direction order the one how they ſhall execute Writs, and the other how they ſhall give Judgments, though theſe made by himſelf.</p>
            <p>'Tis criminal, no doubt, for any to ſay, that the King deſires a Court of Juſtice, or a Jury, to vary from the direction of the Law, and they ought not to be believed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: If Letters, Writs, or other Commands ſhould come to the Judges for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they are bound by their Oaths not to regard them, but to hold them for null; the Statutes of 2 <hi>E.</hi> 3.8. and 20 <hi>E.</hi> 3.1. are expreſs, That if any Writs or Commandments come to the Juſtices in diſturbance of the Law, or the Execution of the ſame, or of right to the Parties, they ſhall proceed as if no ſuch Letters, Writs, or Commands were come to them: And the ſubſtance of theſe and other Statutes is inſerted into the Oath taken by every Judge; and if they be under the moſt ſolemn and ſacred Tye in the Execution of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, to hold for nothing, or none, the Commands of the King under the Great Seal, ſurely the Word, or Deſire of an Attorney-General, in the like caſe, ought to be leſs than nothing.</p>
            <p>Beſides, they are ſtrangely miſtaken, who think the King can have an Intereſt different from, or contrary unto that of the Kingdom, in the proſecution of Accuſed Perſons: His Concernments are involved in thoſe of his People; and he can have none diſtinct from them. He is the Head of the Body Politick; and the legal Courſe of doing Juſtice, is like the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly circulation of the Blood in the Natural Bodies, by which both Head and Body are equally preſerved, and both periſh by the interruption of it.</p>
            <p>The King is obliged to the utmoſt of his Power, to maintain the Law, and Juſtice in its due courſe, by his Coronation Oath, and the Truſt thereby repoſed in him. In former Ages he was conjured not to take the Crown, unleſs he reſolved punctually to obſerve it.

The violation of which Truſt cannot but be as well a wound unto their Conſciences, as bring great Prejudice upon their Perſons and Affairs.</p>
            <p>The Common-Law that exacts this, doth ſo far provide for Princes, That having their minds free from cares of preſerving themſelves, they may reſt aſſured, that no Acts, Words, or Deſigns, that may bring them into danger, can be concealed from the many Hundreds of Men, who by the Law are appointed in all parts of the Kingdom, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to take care of the King; and are ſo far concerned in His ſafety, that they can hope no longer to enjoy their own Lives and Fortunes in Peace, than they can preſerve him, and the good Order which according to the Laws he is to uphold.</p>
            <p>It is the joynt Intereſt of King and People, that the ancient Rules of doing Juſtice be held ſacred and inviolable; and they are equally concerned in cauſing ſtrict enquiries to be made into all Evidences given againſt ſuſpected, or accuſed Perſons, that the Truth may be diſcovered; and ſuch as dare to diſturb the Publick Peace by breaking the Laws, may be brought to puniſhment.

            <p>The whole Courſe of doing Juſtice upon Criminals, from the beginning of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, unto the Execution of the Sentence, is, and ever was eſteemed to be the Kingdoms concernment, as is evidenced by the frequent Complaints made in Parliament, that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Offenders were pardon'd to the Peoples damage and wrong. In the 13 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. it is ſaid, that the King hearing the grievous complaints of his Commons in Parliament, of the outragious miſchiefs which happened unto the Realm, for that Treaſons, Murders, and Rapes of Women, be commonly done, and committed, and the more becauſe Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Pardon had been eaſily granted in ſuch Caſes; And thereupon it was enacted, That no Pardon for ſuch Crimes ſhould be granted, unleſs the ſame were particularly ſpecified therein; and if a Pardon were otherwiſe granted for the Death of a Man, the Judges ſhould notwithſtanding enquire by a Grand Jury, of the Neighbourhood, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Death of every ſuch Perſon, and if he were found to have been wilfully Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, ſuch Charter of Pardon to be diſallowed; and proviſions were made by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing grievous Fines upon every perſon, according to his Degree and Quality, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, who ſhould preſume to ſue to the King for any Pardons of the aforeſaid Crimes, and that ſuch perſons might be known to the whole Kingdom, their Names were to be upon ſeveral Records. The like had been done in many Statutes made by ſeveral Parliaments, as in the 6 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1.9. the 2 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.2. the 10 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.2. and the 14 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.15. where it was acknowledged by the King in Parliament, <hi>That the Oath of the Crown had not been kept, by reaſon of the Grant of Pardons contrary to the aforeſaid Statutes; and Enacted that any ſuch Charter of Pardon, from thenceforth granted againſt the Oath of his Crown, and the ſaid Statutes, the ſame ſhould be holden for none.</hi> In the 27 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.2. It is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther provided, for preventing the Peoples damage by ſuch Pardons, <hi>That from thenceforth in every Charter of Pardon of Felony, which ſhall be granted at any mans ſuggeſtion, the ſaid ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, and the name of him that maketh the ſuggeſtion, ſhall be compriſed in the ſame Charter; and if after the ſame ſuggeſtion be found untrue, the Charter ſhall be diſallowed and holden for none: And the Juſtices before whom ſuch Charter ſhall be alledged, ſhall enquire of the ſame ſuggeſtion, and that as well of Charters granted before this time, as of Charters which ſhall be granted in time to come; and if they find them untrue, then they ſhall diſallow the Charter ſo alledged, and ſhall moreover do as the Law demandeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have Parliaments from time to time declared, that the Offences againſt the Crown are againſt the publick welfare, and that Kings are obliged by their Oath and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48501:127"/>Office to cauſe Juſtice to be done upon Traytors and Felons for the Kingdom's ſake; according to the ancient Common-Law,
<note place="margin">9 Hen 3.29.</note> declared by <hi>Magna Charta</hi> in theſe words: <hi>Nulli negabimus, nulli vendemus, nulli differemeus Juſtitiam.</hi> VVe will ſell to no Man, we will not deny or defer to any Man either Juſtice or Right.</p>
            <p>And as the publick is concerned, that the due and legal Methods be obſerved in the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Offenders, ſo likewiſe doth the ſecurity of every ſingle Man in the Nation depend upon it: No Man can aſſure himſelf he ſhall not be accuſed of the higheſt crimes. Let a Man's Innocence and Prudence be what it will, yet his moſt inoffenſive VVords and Actions are liable to be miſconſtrued, and he may, by Subornation and Conſpiracy, have things laid to his charge, of which he is no ways guilty. VVho can ſpeak or carry himſelf with that circumſpection, as not to have his harmleſs VVords or Actions wreſted to another ſenſe than he intended? VVho can be ſecure from having a Paper put into his Pockets, or laid in his Houſe, of which he ſhall know nothing till his Accuſation?

Theſe things happening thus, the King thought that he was juſtly ſlain; in this manner the worthy <hi>Epigenes</hi> ended his days: But this great Man's deſigns did not reſt here; for within a while, heightned with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, he ſo arrogantly abuſed His Maſter's Authority, as he grew dangerous to the King himſelf, as well as to thoſe about him; inſomuch as <hi>Antiochus</hi> was forced, for that he hated and feared <hi>Hermes,</hi>
               </q> to take away his Life by Stratagem, thereby to ſecure himſelf. By theſe, and a Thouſand other ways, the moſt unblemiſh'd Innocence may be brought into the greateſt danger. Since then every Man is thus eaſily ſubject to queſtion, and what is one Man's Caſe this day, may be another Man's to morrow, it is undoubtedly every Man's concern to ſee (as far as in him lies) in every caſe, that the accuſed Perſon may have the benefit of all ſuch proviſions, as the Law hath made for the defence of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and Reputation.</p>
            <p>Now to this end there is nothing ſo neceſſary as the ſecret and ſeparate examination of Witneſſes, for though perhaps (as hath been already obſerved) it may be no very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult thing for ſeveral perſons, who are permitted to diſcourſe with each other freely, and to hear, or be told what each of their fellows had been asked and anſwered, to agree in one ſtory, eſpecially if the Jury may not ask what queſtions they ſhall think fit for the ſatisfaction of their own Conſciences; but that they ſhall be ſo far under the correction and cenſure of the Judges, as to have the queſtions which they put, called by them trifles, impertinent, and unfit for the Witneſſes to ſpeak to; yet if they be examined apart, with that due care of ſifting out all the Circumſtances which the Law requires, where every Man of the Jury is at full liberty to enquire into any thing for his clearer Information, and that with what deliberation they think fit, and all this be done with that Secrecy which the Law commands; it will be almoſt impoſſible for a Man to ſuffer under a falſe Accuſation.</p>
            <p>Nor has the Law been leſs careful for the Reputation of the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> than for their Lives and Eſtates, and this ſeems to be one reaſon why in criminal Caſes, a Man ſhall not be brought to an open legal Tryal by a Petit Jury, till the Grand Jury have firſt found the Bill: The Law having entruſted the Grand Inqueſt in a ſpecial manner with their good names; they are therefore not only to enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the fact that is laid, was done by the party accuſed, but into the circumſtances thereof too, whether it were done Traiterouſly, Feloniouſly, or Maliciouſly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the manner charged; which Circumſtances are not barely matter of form, but do conſtitute
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:48501:127"/>the very eſſence of the Crime; and laſtly into the Credit of the Witneſſes, and that of the party accuſed, and unleſs they find both the Fact proved upon him, and ſtrong preſumptions of ſuch aggravating circumſtances attending it, as the Law requires in the ſpecification of ſuch Crime, and likewiſe are ſatisfied in the credibility of the Witneſſes; they ought not to expoſe the Subject to an open Trial in the face of the County, to a certain loſs of his Reputation, and hazard of his Life and Eſtate. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over ſhould this practice of publick Examination prevail, and the Jurors Oath of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy continue, how partial and unequal a thing would it be to declare that to all the World, which will blaſt a Man's good name, and religiouſly conceal what they may know tending to his Juſtification: To examine Witneſſes (perhaps ſuborned) cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly prepared, and have Evidence dreſſed up with all the advantages that Lawyers wits can give it, of the fouleſt Crimes a Man can be guilty of, and this given before ſome thouſands againſt him, and yet for the ſame Court to ſwear thoſe, whom the Law makes Judges in the Caſe, not to reveal one word of thoſe reaſons, which have ſatisfied their Conſciences of his Innocence. What is this, but an Artifice of ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring men (it may be) of the moſt unſpotted Converſation, and of abuſing Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, not ſo much to find Men guilty, as to make them infamous? After this Ignominy is fixed, what Judgment can the Auditors (and from them the World) make, but of high probability of guilt in the party accuſed, and Perjury in the Jury.</p>
            <p>This courſe, if it ſhould be continued, muſt needs be of moſt dangerous conſequence to all ſorts of Men; it will both ſubject every one without relief to be defamed, and fright the beſt and moſt conſcientious Men, from ſerving on Grand Juries, which is a moſt neceſſary part of their duty. Now ſince there is in our Government (as in every one that is well conſtituted there ought to be) great liberty of Accuſation, that no Man may be encouraged to do ill through hopes of impunity, if by this means a Method be opened, for the blaſting the moſt innocent Man's honour, and deterring the moſt honeſt from being his Judges, what remains, but that every Man's Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which is moſt dear unto ſuch as are good, is held precariouſly, and it will be in the power of great Men to pervert the Laws, and take away whoſe Life and Eſtate they pleaſe, or at leaſt to faſten imputations of the moſt deteſted Crimes upon any, whom, for ſecret reaſons they have a mind to defame. The conſequences of which ſcandal, as they are very miſchievous to every Man, ſo in a Trading Country in a more eſpecial manner, to all who live by any vocation of that kind.</p>
            <p>The greateſt part of Trade is driven upon credit, moſt Men of any conſiderable Employment, dealing for much more than they are truly worth, and every Man's cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit depends as well upon his behaviour to the Government he lives under, as upon his private honeſty in his tranſactions between Man and Man: ſo that the ſuſpicion only of his being obnoxious to the Government is enough to ſet all his Creditors upon his back, and put a ſtop to all his Affairs, perhaps to his utter ruine. What expedition and violence will they all uſe to recover their debts, when he ſhall be publickly charged with ſuch Crimes as forfeit Life and Eſtate? Though there ſhould not be one word of the Accuſation true, yet they knowing the Charge and the ſeeming proofs in the Court, and the Conſequences of it, and not being acquainted with the truth, as it appears to the Jury, ſelf intereſt will make his Creditors to draw in their effects, which is no more than a new contrivance, under colour of Law, of undoing honeſt Men.</p>
            <p>If to prevent any of theſe miſchiefs the Jury ſhould diſcover their fellows and their own Counſel, as the Court by publick Examination doth, it would not only be a wilful breach of their Oath, but a betraying of the truſt which the Law has repoſed in them, for the ſecurity of the Subject: For to ſubject the reaſons of their Verdicts upon Bills to the cenſure of the Judges, were to diveſt themſelves of the Power which the Law has given them, for moſt important Conſiderations, without account or controul, and to intereſt thoſe in it, whom the Law has not in this caſe truſted, and ſo by degrees, the courſe of Juſtice in one of the moſt material parts may be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and a fundamental ſecurity of our Liberty and Property inſenſibly loſt. On the other hand, if for fear of being unworthily reproached as <hi>Ignoramus</hi> Jury-Men, obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate fellows, that obſtruct Juſtice, and diſſerve the King, the Grand Jury ſhall ſuffer the Judges, or the King's Counſel to prev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This ſeems to be the greateſt Treaſon, that can be committed againſt the whole Kingdom, and threatens ruine unto every Man in private in it. None can be ſafe againſt
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48501:128"/>authorized Malice, and notwithſtanding the care of our Anceſtors, Rapine, Murther, and the worſt of Crimes may be advanced by the formality of Verdicts, if Grand Juries be overawed, or not ſuffered to enquire into the Truth, to the ſatisfaction of their Conſciences. Every Man whilſt he lives innocently, doth, under God, place his hopes of ſecurity in the Law, which can give no protection, if its due courſe be ſo interrupted, that frauds cannot be diſcovered, Witneſſes may as well favour Offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as give falſe teſtimony againſt the guiltleſs, and if they, by hearing what each other ſaith, are put into a way of concealing their villainous deſigns, there can be no legal Revenge of the crimes already committed. Others by their impunity will be encouraged to do the like: And every quiet minded Perſon will be equally expoſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to private injuries, and ſuch as may be done unto him, under the colour of Law. No man can promiſe unto himſelf any ſecurity for his Life or Goods, and they who do not ſuffer the utmoſt violences in their own perſons, may do it in their Children, Friends, and neareſt Relations, if he be deprived of the remedies that the Law or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains, and forced to depend upon the Will of a Judge, who may be (and perhaps we may ſay) are too often corrupted, or ſwayed by their own Paſſions, Intereſts, or the impulſe of ſuch as are greater than they. This miſchief is aggravated by a common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received Opinion, that whoſoever ſpeaks againſt an accuſed perſon is the King's Witneſs, and the worſt of men, in their worſt deſigns, do uſually ſhelter themſelves under that name, whereas he only is the King's Witneſs, who ſpeaks the truth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be for or againſt him that is accuſed. As the Power of the King's the Power of the Law, he can have no other intention than that of the Law, which is to have Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice impartially adminiſtred, and as he is the Father of his People, he cannot but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline ever to the gentleſt ſide, unleſs i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> Malefactors, as a burthen, and rather wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he had not learnt to write, than to be obliged to do it. They who by ſpreading ſuch barbarous errours, would create unto the King, an intereſt different from that of his People which he is to preſerve, whilſt they pretend to ſerve him in deſtroying of them, they deprive him of his honour and dignity; Juſtice is done in all places, in the name of the chief Magiſtrate, it being preſumed, that he doth em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace every one of his Subjects with equal tenderneſs, until the guilty are by legal proofs diſcriminated from the Innocent, and amongſt us the King's name may be uſed in civil caſes, as well as criminal: But it is as impoſſible for him rightly to deſire I ſhould be condemned for killing a Man whom I have not killed, or a Treaſon that I have not committed, as that my Land ſhould be unjuſtly taken from me by a judgment in his Bench, or I ſhould be condemned to pay a debt that I do not owe.</p>
            <p>In both Caſes we ſue unto him for Juſtice, and demand it as our right. We are all concerned in it, publickly, and privately, and the King, as well as all the Officers of Juſtice, are by their ſeveral Oaths, obliged in their reſpective capacities to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it. They are bound to give their aſſiſtance to find out Offenders, and the King's Attorney is by his Oath to proſecute them, if he be required; and he is not only the King's ſervant in ſuch caſes, but the Nations; or rather, cannot otherwiſe ſerve the King, than by ſeeing Juſtice done in the Nation. Whenſoever any Man receives an injury in his Perſon, Wife, Children, Friends, or Goods, the King is injured, in as much as he is by his Office to prevent ſuch miſchief, and ought to be concerned in the Welfare of every one of his Subjects; but the parties to whom the injuries are done, are the immediate ſufferers, and the proſecution is principally made, that they may be repared or revenged, and other innocent perſons ſecured by the puniſhment of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, in which the King can be no otherwiſe concerned, than as he is to ſee his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice faithfully performed, and his People protected. The King's ſuit therefore is in the behalf of his People, yet the Law leaves unto every man a Liberty, in caſe of Treaſons, Murthers, Rapes, Robberies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ſue in the King's name, and crave his aid, or by way of appeal in his own. The ſame Law looks upon Felons, or Traitors as publick Enemies, and by authorizing every one to purſue or apprehend them, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, that every man, in his place, ought to do it. The ſame Act whereby one or a few are injured, threatneth all, and every Man's private intereſt ſo concurs with that of the publick, that all depends upon the exact preſervation of the Method preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the Law, for the impartial inquiſition after ſuſpected Offenders, and moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der care of preſerving ſuch as are innocent. As this cannot poſſibly be effected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſecret and ſeparate examinations, the forbidding them is no leſs, than to change
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:48501:128"/>the Courſe, which is enjoyned by Law, confirmed by cuſtom, and grounded upon Reaſon and Juſtice.</p>
            <p>If on the other ſide any man believe, that ſuch as in the King's name proſecute ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Delinquents, ought only to try how they may bring them to be condemned, he may be pleaſed to conſider, that all ſuch perſons ought, according unto Law, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce no Witneſs whom they do not think to be true: No Evidence which they do not believe good, nor can conceal any thing that may juſtifie the accuſed. No trick or Artifice can be lawfully uſed to deceive a Grand Jury, or induce them to find or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject a Bill, otherwiſe than as they are led by their own Conſciences. All Lawyers were anciently ſworn to put no deceit upon the Courts for their Clients ſake, and there are Statutes ſtill in force to puniſh them, if they do it, but there is an eternal obligation upon ſuch as are of Counſel againſt perſons accuſed of Crimes, not to uſe ſuch Arts as may bring the Innocent to be condemned, and thereby parvert that which is not called the Judgment of Man, but of God, becauſe Man renders it in the ſtead, and by the Commandment of God; ſuch practices exalt the Juriſdiction of Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, but infect and polute them with that Innocent Blood, which will be their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw: And leaſt of all, can it be called a Service to the King, ſince none could ever ſtand againſt the cry of it. This is neceſſarily implyed in the Attorney General's Oath, to ſerve the King in his Kingly Office, wherein the Law preſumes he can do no wrong: But the greateſt of all wrongs, and that which hath been moſt deſtructive unto Thrones, is by Fraud to circumvent and deſtroy the Innocent: This is to turn a Legal King into a <hi>Nimrod,</hi> a Hunter of Men: This is not to act the part of a Father or a Shepherd, who is ready to lay down his Life for his Sheep, but ſuch as the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt complains of, who eat up the People as if they eat Bread: <hi>Jezebel</hi> did perhaps applaud her own Wit, and think ſhe had done a great Service to the King, by finding out Men of <hi>Belial,</hi> Judges, and Witneſſes to bring <hi>Naboth</hi> to be ſtoned; but that unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded Blood was a Canker, or the Plague of Leproſie in his Throne and Family, which could not be cured but by its overthrow and extinction. But if the Attorney Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral cannot ſerve the King by abuſing Juries, and ſubverting the Innocent, he can as little gain an advantage to himſelf by falſifying his Oath, by the true meaning where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is to proſecute Juſtice Impartially, and the Eternal Divine Law would annul any Oath or Promiſe that he ſhould have taken to the contrary, even though his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice had obliged him unto it.</p>
            <p>The like Obligation lies upon Jurors not to ſuffer themſelves to be deluded, or perſuaded, that the Judges, King's Council, or any others can diſpenſe with that Oath, or any part of it, which they have taken before God unto the whole Nation; nor to think that they can ſwerve from the Rules ſet by the Law without a damnable breach of it. The pwoer of relating, or diſſolving Conſcientious Obligations, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowled in the Pope, makes a great part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Superſtition; and that grand Impoſtor could never corrupt Kingdoms and Nations to their deſtruction, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment of his Tyranny, until he had brought them to believe he could diſpenſe with Oaths, taken by Kings unto their Subjects, and by Subjects to their Kings; nor impoſe ſo extravagant an Errour upon either, until he had perſuaded them he was in the place of God. It is hard to ſay how the Judges or King's Council can have the ſame Power, unleſs it be upon the ſame Title; but we may be ſure they may as well diſpenſe with the whole Oath as any part of it, and can have no pretence unto either, unleſs they have the Keys of Heaven and Hell in their keeping: It is in vain to ſay, the King as any other man may remit the Oath taken unto and for himſelf; He is not a party for himſelf, but in the behalf of his People, and cannot diſpoſe of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments without their Conſent, which is given only in Parliament.</p>
            <p>The King's Council ought to remember, they are in criminal Caſes of Council unto every man in the Kingdom; It is no ways referred unto the Direction of the Judges, or unto them, whether that ſecrecy enjoyned by Law, be profitable unto the King or Kingdom; They muſt take the Law as it is, and render Obedience unto it, until it be altered by the Power that made it. To this end the Judges by Acts of Parliament, <hi>viz.</hi> 18 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. and 20 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. are ſworn to ſerve the People, <hi>Ye ſhall ſerve our Lord the King and his People in the Office of Juſtice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ye ſhall deny to no man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Right by the King's Letters, nor no other mans, nor for no other cauſe; and in default thereof in any point, they are to forfeit their Bodies, Lands, and Goods.</hi> This proves them to be the Peoples Servants as well as the Kings.</p>
            <p>Further by the expreſs words of the Commiſſions of Oyer and Terminer, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to <hi>aſſiſt every man that ſuffers injury, and make diligent inquiſition after all manner of falſhoods, deceits, offences, and wrongs done to any man, and thereupon to do Juſtice accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law:</hi> ſo that in the whole proceedings in order unto Tryal, and in the Tryals
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:48501:129"/>themſelves, the Thing principally intended, which ſeveral perſons are ſeverally in their capacities obliged to purſue, is, the diſcovery of Truth: The Witheſſes are to depoſe <hi>the Truth, the whole Truth, and Nothing but the Truth:</hi> Thereupon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil for the King are to proſecute: The Grand Jury to preſent: and the Petit Jury to try: Theſe are ſeveral Offices, but all to the ſame End; 'Tis not the Priſoner, but the Crime that is to be purſued; This primarily, the Offender but by conſequence; and therefore ſuch Courſes muſt be taken, as may diſcover that, and not ſuch as may enſnare him: When the Offence is found, the impartial Letter of the Law gives the Doom; and the Judges have no ſhare in it, but the pronouncing of it: Till then the Judges are only to preſide, and take Care, that every man elſe, who is employed in this neceſſary Affair, do his duty according to Law. So that upon reſult of the whole tranſaction impartial Juſtice may be done, either to the Acquittal or condemnation of the Priſoner.</p>
            <p>Hereby it is manifeſt why the Judges are obliged by Oath, To <hi>Serve the People as well as the King:</hi> And by Commiſſion, To <hi>Serve every One that Suffers Injuries.</hi> As they are to See that Right be done to the King, and His injur'd Subjects in diſcovering of the Delinquent; So they are to be of Council with the Priſoner, whom the Law ſuppoſeth may be ignorant as well as innocent; and therefore has provided, that the Court ſhall be of Council for him, and as well inform him of what Legal advantages the Law allows him, as to reſolve any point of Law when he ſhall propoſe it to them; And it ſeems to be upon the preſumption of this ſteady impartiality in the Judges, (thus obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by all that is held Sacred before God and man to be unbyaſſed) that the Priſoner hath no Council; for if the Court faithfully perform their duty, the Accuſed can have no wrong, or hardſhip, and therefore needs no Adviſer.</p>
            <p>Now ſuppoſe a man perfectly innocent, and in ſome meaſure knowing in the Law, ſhould be accuſed of Treaſon or Felony; If the Judges ſhall deny unto the Grand Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the liberty of examining any Witneſſes, except in open Court, where nothing ſhall be offered that may help to clear the Priſoner, but every Thing aggravated, that gives colour for the Accuſation; ſuch Perſons only produced, as the King's Council, or the Proſecutors ſhall think fit to call, of whoſe Credit alſo the Jury muſt not inquire, but ſhall be controll'd and brow-beaten in asking Queſtions, of ſuch unknown Witneſſes, for their own Satisfaction, if they have any Tendency to diſcover the Infamy of theſe Witneſſes, or the Falſhood of their Teſtimony; How can Innocence ſecure any Man from being arraigned?</p>
            <p>And if the Oath of the Judges ſhould be as much forgotten in the further Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon the Trial, where in Caſes of Treaſon the Priſoner ſhall have all the King's Council (commonly not the moſt unlearned) prepared with ſtudied Speeches, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, to make him black and odious, and to Strain all his words, and to alledge them for Inſtances of his guilt: If then all his private Papers, and Notes to help his Memory in his Plea, and Defence, ſhall be taken from him by the Gaoler, or the Court, and given to his Proſecutors; And all Advice and Aſſiſtance from Councils, or Friends, and his neareſt Relations ſhall be denied him, and none ſuffered by word or writing to inform him of the indifferency, or honeſty, or the partiality or malice of the Pannels returned (whom the Law allows him to challenge or refuſe, either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily, or for good Reaſons offered;) ſhould he be thus deprived of all the good proviſions of the Law for his ſafety, To what Frauds, Perjuries, and Subornations is not he, and every man Expoſed, who may be accuſed? What Deceits may there not be put upon Juries? and what Probability is there of finding Security in Innocence? What an admirable Execution would this be of their Commiſſion, To <hi>make diligent Inquiſition after all manner of Falſhoods, Deceipts, Wrongs and Frauds, and thereupon to do Juſtice accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Law?</hi> When at the ſame Time, if ſo Managed, a Method would be introduced of ruining and deſtroying any Man in the form of Juſtice. Such practices would be the higheſt diſhonour to the King imaginable, whoſe name is uſed, and ſo far Miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Kingly Office, as to make that appear, to have been Erected to vex and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the People, which was intended, and ordained to help and preſerve them.</p>
            <p>The Law ſo far abhors ſuch proceedings, that it intends, that every Man ſhould be ſtrictly bound, to be exactly juſt in their ſeveral Imployments, relating to the Execution of Juſtice. The Serjeant, of the King's Council (Sir <hi>George Jefferys,</hi> among the reſt) who proſecute in the King's name, and are conſulted in the forming Bills of Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and adviſe about the Witneſſes and their Teſtimonies againſt the Accuſed; Theſe (if they would remember it) when they are made Serjeants, take an Oath (<hi>Cokes</hi> 2d. Inſtitutes, Pag. 214.) <hi>as well and truly to ſerve the People</hi> (whereof the party accuſed is one) <hi>as the King himſelf, and to miniſter the King's matters duely and truly after the courſe of the Law to their Cunning;</hi> Not to uſe their Cunning and Craft to hide the Truth, and deſtroy the accuſed if they can.</p>
            <pb n="243" facs="tcp:48501:129"/>
            <p>They are alſo obliged by the Statute of <hi>Weſtm.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 29. To put no manner of Deceit or Colluſion upon the King's Court, nor ſecretly to conſent to any ſuch Tricks as may abuſe or beguile the Court, or the party, be it in Cauſes Civil or Criminal: And it is ordained, that if any of them be convicted of ſuch practices, he ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned for a year, and never be heard to plead again in any Court; and if the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous conſequence of their Treacheries be great, they are Subject to further and greater puniſhments. Our Antient Law Book called <hi>the Miror of Juſtice, Cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. ſays, <hi>That every Serjeant Pleader is chargeable by his Oath, not to maintain or defend any Wrong or Falſhood to his Knowledge, but ſhall leave his Client when he ſhall perceive the wrong intended by him: Alſo that he ſhall not move or proffer any falſe Teſtimony, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to any Lyes, Deceits, or Corruptions whatſoever in his pleadings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As a further Security unto the People againſt all Attempts upon their Laws, Exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Juſtice hath been done, in ſeveral Ages, upon ſuch Judges, and Juſticiaries, as through Corruption, Submiſſion unto unjuſt Commands, or any other Siniſter conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, have dared to ſwerve from them: The puniſhments of theſe wicked Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main upon Record, as Monuments of their Infamy to be a Terror unto all that ſhall ſucceed them. In the Reign of the <hi>Saxons</hi> the moſt notable Example was given by King <hi>Alfred,</hi> who caus'd above forty Judges to be hanged in a Short Space, for ſeveral wrongs done to the People, as is related in <hi>the Mirror of Juſtice:</hi> Some of them ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for impoſing on Juries, and forcing them to give Verdicts according to their will; And one, as it ſeems, had taken the Confidence to examine a Jury, that he might find which of them would Submit to his Will, and ſetting aſide him who would not, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned a Man upon the Verdict of Eleven.</p>
            <p>Since the Coming of the <hi>Normans,</hi> our Parliaments have not been leſs ſevere againſt ſuch Judges, as have ſuffered the courſe of Juſtice to be perverted, or the Rights and Liberties of the People to be invaded: In the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the 1ſt <hi>Anno</hi> 1289. The Parliament finding, That all the Judges (except Two) had ſwerv'd from their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, condemned them to ſeveral puniſhments according unto their Crimes,
<note place="margin">

               </note> As Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Perpetual Impriſonment, or the loſs of all their Eſtates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their Particular Offences are ſpecified in a Speech made by the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in Parliament. They had broken <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> Incited the King againſt his People; Violated the Laws under pretence of expounding them; and impudently preſumed to prefer their own Councils to the King, before the Advices of Parliament, as appears by the ſpeech, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hereunto annext.</p>
            <p>The like was done in <hi>Ed.</hi> the 2d. Time, when <hi>Hugh De Spencer</hi> was charged for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving prevailed with the King to break his Oath to the People, in doing Things againſt the Law by his own Authority.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d. Time Judge <hi>Thorpe</hi> was hang'd for having in the like manner brought the King to break his Oath:
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan.

            <p>In <hi>Richard</hi> the Second's Time, Eleven of the Judges,
<note place="margin">See all the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Hiſtories of <hi>Walſingham, Fabian, Speed,</hi> &amp;c. in the 11 and 12 years of <hi>Richard</hi> II.</note> forgetting the dreadful Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Predeceſſors, ſubſcrib'd malicious Indictments againſt Law, and gave falſe Interpretations of our Ancient Laws to the King, thereby to bring many of his moſt Eminent, and worthieſt Subjects, to ſuffer as Traytors at his Will: Subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Authority, and very Being of Parliaments to his abſolute pleaſure, And made him believe, that all the Laws lay in his own breaſt: Hereupon ſentence of death paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon them; and tho upon their repentance, and confeſſing, they had been ſwayed by fear, and threatnings from the King, Two only were Executed, all the others were for ever baniſhed, as unworthy to enjoy the benefit of that Law, which they had ſo perfidiouſly, and baſely betrayed.</p>
            <p>It were an Endleſs work to recite all the Examples of this kind that are found in our Hiſtories and Records; but that of <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudley</hi> muſt not be omitted: They had craftily contriv'd to aboliſh Grand Juries and to draw the Lives and Eſtates of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into queſtion, without Indictments by them; and by ſurpriſe, and other wicked practices, they gained an Act of Parliament for their countenance: Hereupon falſe Accuſations followed without number; Oppreſſion and Injuſtice broke forth like a Flood, And to gain the King's Favour, they fill'd his Coffers: The Indictments againſt them mentioned in <hi>Anderſon</hi>'s Reports, Pa. 156, 157, are worth reading; whereby they are charged <hi>with Treaſon, for Subverting the Laws, and Cuſtoms of the Land, in their proceedings without Grand Juries, and procuring the murmuring and hatred of the People againſt the King, to the great danger of him, and the Kingdom.</hi> Nothing could ſatisfy the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, tho 'the King was dead, whom they had flattered, and ſerved, but ſuch Juſtice
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:48501:130"/>done upon them, and many of their Inſtruments, and Officers, as may for ever make the Ears of Judges to tingle.</p>
            <p>And it is not to be forgotten, that the Judges in Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> time, in the Caſe of R. <hi>Cavendiſh</hi> in <hi>Anderſon</hi>'s Reports, P. 152, and 155. <hi>were</hi> (as they told the Queen, and her Councellors) <hi>by the puniſhment of former Judges, eſpecially of</hi> Empſon <hi>and</hi> Dudley, <hi>deterred from obeying her illegal Commands:</hi> The Queen had ſent ſeveral Letters under her Signet; Great Men preſſed them to obey her Patent under the Great Seal, and the Reaſons of their diſobedience being required; they anſwered, <hi>That the Queen her ſelf, and the Judges alſo had taken an Oath to keep the Laws; And if they ſhould obey her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, the Laws would not warrant them, and they ſhould therein break their Oath, to the Offence of God, and their Country, and the Common-wealth wherein they were born; And;</hi> ſay they, <hi>if we had no fear of God, yet the Examples, and Puniſhments of others before us, who did offend the Laws, do remember, and recall us from the like Offences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whoſoever being in the like places may deſign, or be put upon the like practices, will do well to conſider theſe Examples, and not to think, that he, who obliquely En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to render Grand Juries uſeleſs, is leſs Criminal, than he, that would abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely aboliſh them: That which doth not act according to its Inſtitution, is, as if it were not in being: And whoever doth without prejudice conſider this matter, will ſee that it is not leſs pernicious to deny Juries the uſe of thoſe Methods of diſcovering Truth which the Law hath appointed, and ſo by degrees turn them into a meer mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of form, than openly, and avowedly to deſtroy them. Surely ſuch a gradual Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of deſtroying our Native Right is the moſt dangerous in its conſequence. The ſafety, which our Fore-fathers for many hundred of years, enjoyed under this part of the Law eſpecially, and have tranſmitted to us, is ſo apparent to the meaneſt Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that whoever ſhall go about to take it away, or give it up, is like to meet with the fate of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> to have every man's hand againſt him, becauſe he is againſt every Man. Artifices of this Kind, will ruine us more ſilently, and ſo with leſs oppoſition, and yet as certainly, as the other more moved oppreſſion: This only is the difference, that one way we ſhould be ſlaves immediately, and the other inſenſibly; But with this further diſadvantage too, that our ſlavery ſhould be the more unavoydable, and the faſter rivited upon us, becauſe it would be under colour of Law, which Practice in Time would obtain.</p>
            <p>Few men at firſt ſee the danger of little changes in Fundamentals, and thoſe, who deſign them, uſually act with ſo much craft, as beſides the giving ſpecious Reaſons, they take great Care, that the true Reaſon ſhall not appear: Every deſign therefore of changing the Conſtitution ought to be moſt warily obſerved, and timely oppoſed; Nor is it only the Intereſt of the People, that ſuch Fundamentals ſhould be duly guarded, for whoſe benefit they were at firſt ſo carefully layed, and whom the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are ſworn to ſerve; but of the King too, for whoſe ſake thoſe pretend to act, who would ſubvert them.</p>
            <p>Our Kings as well as Judges are ſworn to maintain the Laws; They have them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſeveral Statutes required the Judges, at their peril, to adminiſter Equal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to every Man, notwithſtanding any Letters, or Commauds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> even from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the contrary; And when any failure hath been, the greateſt, and moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful of them have ever been the readieſt to give Redreſs. It appears by the Preface to the Statutes of 20th <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. that the Judicial proceedings had been perverted, That Letters, Writs and Commands had been ſent from the King, and great Men to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices, and that Perſons belonging to the Court of the King, the Queen, the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> had maintained, and abetted Quarrels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby the Laws had been viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and many wrongs done: But the King was ſo far from juſtifying his own Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or thoſe illegal practices; That the preamble of thoſe Statutes ſaith, they were made for the relief of the People in their ſufferings by them. That brave King in the height of his glory, and vigor of his Age, choſe rather to confeſs his Error, than to continue in it, as is evident by his own words. Edward, <hi>by the Grace of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by divers Complaints made unto us, we have perceived that the Law of the Land, which we by our Oath are bound to maintain, is the leſs well kept, and Execution of the ſame diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed many times by maintenances and procurements, as well in the Court as the Country, We greatly moved of Conſcience in this matter, and for this Cauſe, deſiring as much for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, and eaſe and quietneſs of our Subjects, as to ſave our Conſcience, and for to ſave and keep our ſaid Oath, by the Aſſent,</hi> &amp;c. Enact. <hi>That Judges ſhall do Juſtice, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Writs, Letters or Commands from himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that none of the King's Houſe, or belonging to the King, Queen, or Prince of</hi> Wales <hi>do maintain Quarrels,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> in his Speech to the Judges in the <hi>Starchamber, Anno.</hi> 1616. told them; <hi>That he had after many years reſolved to renew his Oath, made at his Coronation, concerning
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48501:130"/>Juſtice, and the promiſe therein contained for maintaining the Law of the Land.</hi> And in the next page ſave one ſays, <hi>I was ſworn to maintain the Law of the Land, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had been perjured, if I had broken it; God is my Judge I never intended it.</hi> And His Majeſty, that now is, hath made frequent Declarations, and Proteſtations of his being far from all thoughts of deſigning an Arbitrary Government, and that the Nation might be confident, he would rule by Law.</p>
            <p>Now if after all this, any Officer of the Kings ſhould pretend Inſtructions from his Maſter, to demand ſo material an alteration of proceedings, in the higheſt Caſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Law, as are above mentioned, And the Court (who are required to ſlight and reject the moſt ſolemn Commands under the Great Seal, if contrary to Law) ſhould upon a verbal Intimation allow of ſuch a Demand, and ſo break in upon this Bulwark of our Liberties, which the Law has erected; Might it not give too juſt an occaſion to ſuſpect, that all the legal ſecurities of our Lives, and Properties are unable to protect us? And may not ſuch fears rob the King of his greateſt Treaſure and Strength, the Peoples hearts, when they dare not rely upon him in his Kingly Office, and truſt, for ſafety and protection by the Laws? Our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtory affords many inſtances of thoſe that have pretended to ſerve our King in this manner, by undermining the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Right and Liberties, whoſe practices have ſometimes proved of fatal conſequence to the Kings themſelves, but more frequently ended in their own deſtruction.</p>
            <p>But after all imagining it could be made out, that this Method of private Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by a Grand Jury (which from what has been ſaid before, hath appeared to be ſo extremely neceſſary for the publick good, and to every private man's ſecurity) were inconvenient or miſchievous, and therefore fit to be changed; yet being ſo Eſſential a part of the Common Law, it is no otherwiſe alterable than by Parliament. We find by Preſidents, that the bare forms of Indictments could not be reformed by the Judges: The words <hi>Depopulatores agrorum, Inſidiator es viarum, Vi &amp; Armis, Baculis, Cultellis, Arcubus &amp; ſagittis,</hi> could not be left out, but by advice of the Kingdom in Parliament. A Writ iſſued in the time of K. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. giving power to hear and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Offences, and all the Juſtices reſolved (<hi>Cok.</hi> 4. Inſt. Pag. 164.) <hi>That they could not lawfully act, having their Authority by Writ, where they ought to have had it by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; Tho' it was in the form and words, that the Legal Commiſſion ought to be.</hi> John Knivett <hi>Chief Juſtice, by Advice of all the Judges, reſolved that the ſaid Writ was</hi> Contra Legem: <hi>And where divers Indictments were before them found againſt</hi> T.S. <hi>the ſame, and all that was done by colour of that Writ, was Damned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If in ſuch ſeeming little Things as theſe, and many others, that may be inſtanced, the Wiſdom of the Nation hath not thought fit to intruſt the Judges, but reſerved the Conſideration of them to the Legiſlative Power; It cannot be imagined, that they ſhould ſubject to the diſcretion and pleaſure of the Judges, thoſe important Points, in the Eſtabliſhed courſe of the adminiſtring Juſtice, whereupon depends the ſafety of all the Subjects Lives, and Fortunes. If Judges will take upon themſelves to alter the conſtant practice, they muſt either alter the Oath of the Grand Jury, or continue it; If they ſhould alter it, ſo as to make it ſail with any ſuch new Method, and thus in appearance charitably provide, that the Grand Jury ſhould not take a mock Oath, or forſwear themſelves; they then make an incroachment upon the Authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, who only can make new, or change old Legal Oaths, and all the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings thereupon would be void.</p>
            <p>If they ſhould continue conſtantly to impoſe the ſame Oath, as well when they have notice from the King, that the Jury ſhall not be bound to keep his Secrets, and their own, as when they have none; they muſt aſſume to make the ſame form of Law to be of force, and no force; and the ſame words to bind the Conſcience, as they will have them; whereby they would prophane the Natural Religion of an Oath, and bring a foul ſcandal upon Chriſtianity, by trifling worſe than Heathens in that ſacred mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and whilſt the Judges find themſelves under the neceſſity of adminiſtring the Oath unto Grand Juries, and not ſuffer them to obſerve it according unto their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, they would confeſs, the illegality of their own Proceedings, and can never be able to repair the Breaches, by pretending a tacite Implication, if the King will, but muſt unavoidably fall under that approved Maxim of our Law, <hi>Maledicta eſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretatio quae corrumpit Textum;</hi> It is a Curſed Interpretation that diſſolves the Text.</p>
            <p>There are Two Vulgar Errours concerning the duty of Grand Juries, which if not removed, will in time deſtroy all the benefit we can expect from that Conſtitution, by turning them into a meer matter of form, which were deſigned for ſo great Ends. Many have of late, thought, and affirmed it for Law, that the Grand Jury is neither to make ſo ſtrict inquiry into matters before them, nor to look for ſo clear Evidence of the Crime, as the Petit Jury; but that of their Preſentments, being to paſs a ſecond Examination, they ought to Indict upon a ſuperficial Inquiry, and bare probabilities:
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:48501:131"/>Whereas ſhould either of theſe Opinions be admitted, the prejudice to the Subject would be equal to the total laying aſide Grand Juries; there being in truth no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between arraigning without any Preſentment from them at all, and their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting upon ſlight grounds.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, that Grand Juries ought not to make ſo ſtrict Inquiry, it were to be wiſht, that we might know how it comes to paſs, that an Oath ſhould be obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory unto a Petit Jury, and not unto the Grand: Or in what Points they may lawfully and with good Conſcience omit that Exactneſs, whether in relation to the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and their credibility: Or the fact and all its circumſtances: Or the Teſtimony and its weight: Or laſtly, in reference to the Priſoner, and Probability of his guilt: And withal upon what grounds of Law, or Reaſon their Opinion is founded. On the contrary, he that will conſider either the Oath they take, or the Commiſſion, where their duty is deſcribed, will find in all Points, that there lies an equal Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon them, and the Petit Juries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They ſwear diligently to inquire, and true Preſentment make, &amp;c. and to Preſent the Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth, &amp;c.</hi> And in the Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> their duty (with that of the Commiſſioners) is thus deſcribed: <hi>Ad In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirendum per Sacramentum Proborum &amp; legalium hominum, &amp;c. per quos rei veritas melius ſciri poterit, de quibuſcun<expan>

And of other Articles and Circumſtances premiſed, and of any other Thing or Things howſoever concerning the ſame:</hi> Now for any Man, after this to maintain, that Grand Juries are not to inquire, or not carefully, is as much as in plain terms to ſay they are bound to act contrary to the Commiſſion, and their Oath; And to affirm that they can diſcharge their duty according to the Obligations of Law and Conſcience which they lie under, without a ſtrict Inquiry into particulars, is to affirm, that the End can be obtained without the means neceſſary unto it.</p>
            <p>The truth is, that Grand Juries have both a larger field for their Inquiry, and are in many reſpects better capacitated to make a ſtrict one, than the Petit Juries: Theſe laſt are confined as to the Perſon and the Crime, ſpecified in the Indictment; But they are at large obliged to ſearch into the whole matter, that any ways concerns e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Caſe before them, and all the Offences contained in it, all the Criminal Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances whatſoever, and into every thing, howſoever concerning the ſame. They are bound to enquire whether their Information of Suſpected Treaſons or Felonies, brought by Accuſers, be made by Conſpiracy, or Subornation; who are the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, or falſe Witneſſes: By whom abbetted, or maintained; Againſt whom, and how many the Conſpiracy is layed; when, and how, and in what courſe it was to have been proſecuted.</p>
            <p>But none of theſe moſt intricate matters (which need the moſt ſtrict and diligent Inquiries) can come under the Cogniſance of the Petit Jury; They can only examine ſo much as relates to the Credit of thoſe Witneſſes brought to prove the Charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Parties <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ndicted; wherein alſo they have neither Power, nor convenient time to ſend for Perſons, or Papers, if they think them needful, nor to reſolve any doubts of the Lawfulneſs and Credibility of the Teſtimonies.</p>
            <p>Yet further, if the Crimes objected are manifeſt, 'tis then the Grand Juries duty to inquire after all the Perſons any ways concerned in them, and the ſeveral kinds of Offences, whereof every one ought joyntly, or ſeparately to be indicted as they ſhall diſcover them to have been Principals, or Acceſſories, Parties or privy thereunto, or to have comforted, or knowingly relieved either the Traitors or Felons, or conceal'd the offences of others: But the Inquiſition into all theſe matters, which require all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſtrictneſs in ſearching, as being of the higheſt importance unto the publick Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and ſafety, is wholly out of the Power and Truſt of the Petit Juries. The guilt, or innocence of the Parties put upon their Trials, and the Evidence thereof given, is the only Objects of their Inquiries. It is not their work, nor within their truſt to ſearch into all the guilt or crimes of the Parties whom they try; They are bound to move within the Circle of the Indictment made by the Grand Jury, who are to appoint and ſpecify the offences for which the Accuſed ſhall be tried by the Petit Jury.</p>
            <p>When a Proſecutor ſuggeſts that any Man is criminal, and ought to be indicted, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48501:131"/>to the Grand Jury to hear all the proof he can offer, and to uſe all other means they can, whereby they may come to underſtand the truth of the ſuggeſtion, and every thing or circumſtance that may concern it; Then they are carefully to examine the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Facts, according unto unto the Rules of the Com. Law, or the expreſs words of the Statutes, whereby offences are diſtinguiſhed, and puniſhments allotted unto each of them: 'Tis true, that upon hearing the Party, or his Witneſſes, the Petit Jury may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit or judge the Facts in the Indictment to be leſs heinous, or malicious than they were preſented by the Grand Jury, but cannot aggravate them; which being conſidered, it will eaſily appear by the intent and Nature of the Powers given unto Grand Juries, that they are by their Oaths obliged, and their inſtruction to keep all injuſtice from enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt gates of Courts of Judicature, and to ſecure the innocent not only from puniſhment, but from all diſgrace, vexation, expence, or danger.</p>
            <p>To underſtand our Law clearly herein, the Jurors muſt firſt know the lawful grounds whereupon they may and ought to indict, and then what truly and juſtly ought to be taken for the ground of an Indictment. The principal and moſt certain is the Jurors perſonal knowledge, by their own eyes or ears of the Crimes whereof they indict: Or ſo many pregnant concurring Circumſtances, as fully convince them of the guilt of the Accuſed: When theſe are wanting, the Depoſitions of Witneſſes and their Authority are their beſt Guides in finding Indictments. When ſuch Teſtimonies make the charge manifeſt and clear to the Jury, they are called Evidence, becauſe they make the guilt of Criminals evident, and are like the light that diſcovers what was not ſeen before: All Witneſſes for that reaſon are uſually called the Evidence, taking their name from what they ought to be: Yet Witneſſes may ſwear directly and poſitively to an Accuſation, and be no evidence of its truth to the Jury; ſometimes ſuch remarks may be made upon the Witneſſes, as well in relation to their Reputation and Lives, as to the Matter, Manner, and Circumſtance of their Depoſitions, that from thence the falſhood may appear, or be ſtrongly ſuſpected: It is therefore neceſſary to know what they mean by a probable Cauſe or Evidence, who ſay that our Law requires no more for an Indictment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Probable,</hi> is a Logical Term, relating to ſuch propoſitions, as have an appearance, but no certainty of Truth, ſhewing rather what is not, than what is the matter of Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſms: Theſe may be allowed in Rhetorick, which worketh upon paſſions, and makes uſe of ſuch Colours as are fit to move them, whether true or falſe; but not in Logick, whoſe Object is Truth; as it principally intends to obviate the Errours that may ariſe from the credit given unto appearances, by diſtinguiſhing the uncertain from the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>veri ſimile à vero,</hi> it cannot admit of ſuch Propoſitions, as may be falſe as well as true, it being as impoſſible to draw a certain concluſion from uncertain premiſes, as to raiſe a ſolid Building upon a tottering or ſinking foundation. This ought principally to be conſidered in Courts of Juſtice, which are not erected to bring men into Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but to find who deſerves to be condemned, and thoſe Rules are to be followed by them, which are leaſt liable to deſception. For this Reaſon the Council of the <hi>Areo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagites,</hi> and ſome others of the beſt Judicatures that have been in the World, utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the uſe of Rhetorick, looking upon the Art of perſuading by uncertain proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, as little differing from that of deceiving, and directly contrary to their ends, who by the knowledge of truth deſired to be led into the doing of Juſtice: But if the Art that made uſe of theſe probabilities was baniſhed from uncorrupted Tribunals, as a hindrance unto the diſcovery of Truth, they that would ground Verdicts totally upon them, declare an open neglect of it; and as it is ſaid, that <hi>uno abſurdo dato mille ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quuntur,</hi> if Juries were to be guided by probabilities, the next queſtion would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the more or leſs probable, or what degree of probability is required to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade them to find a Bill: This being impoſſible to fix, the whole Proceedings would be brought to depend upon the Fancies of Men, and as nothing is ſo ſlight but it may move them, there is no ſecurity that innocent Perſons may not be brought every day into danger and trouble. By this means certain miſchiefs will be done, whilſt it is by their own confeſſion uncertain whether they are any ways deſerved by ſuch as ſuffer them to the utter overthrow of all Juſtice.</p>
            <p>If the word <hi>Probable</hi> be taken in a common, rather than a nice Logical ſenſe, it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies no more than likely, or rather likely than unlikely: When a matter is found to be ſo, the Wager is not even, there is odds upon one ſide, and this may be a very good ground for betting in a Tennis Court, or at a Horſe-race, but he that would make the Adminiſtration of Juſtice to depend upon ſuch Points, ſeems to put a very ſmall value upon the fortunes, liberties and reputations of men, and to forget that thoſe who ſit in Courts of Juſtice, have no other buſineſs there than to preſerve them.</p>
            <p>This continues in force, though in a Diologue between a Barriſter and a Grand Jury Man, publiſhed under the Title of the Grand Jury Man's Oath and Office, it be ſaid p. 8. and 9. <hi>That their work is no more than to preſent Offences fit for a Tryal, and for that
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48501:132"/>Reaſon, give in only a Veriſimilar or probable Charge; and others have affirmed, that a far leſs Evidence will warrant a Grand Juries Indictment, than a Petit Juries Verdict.</hi> For nothing can be more oppoſite to the juſtice of our Laws, than ſuch Opinions: All Laws in doubtful Caſes direct a ſuſpenſion of Judgment, or a ſentence in favour of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed perſon: But if this were hearkened unto, Grand Juries ſhould upon their Oaths affirm, they judge him Criminal, when the Evidence is upon ſuch uncertain grounds that they cannot but doubt, whether he is ſo or not.</p>
            <p>It cannot be hereupon ſaid, that no Evidence is ſo clear and full, but it may be falſe, and give the Jury occaſion of doubts, ſo as all Criminals muſt eſcape, if no Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to be found unleſs the proofs are abſolutely certain, for it is confeſs'd, that ſuch Caſes are not capable of an infallible, Mathematical demonſtration: but a Jury that Examines all the Witneſſes, that are likely to give any light concerning the buſineſs in queſtion, and all Circumſtances relating to the fact before them, with the Lives and Credit of thoſe tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> not ſwear, that the Bill is true, but that they in their Conſciences believe that it is ſo; and if they write <hi>Ignoramus</hi> upon the Bill, it is not thereby declared to be falſe, nor the P rſon accuſed acquitted, but the matter is ſuſpended, until it can be more clearly proved, as in doubtful Caſes, it always ought to be.</p>
            <p>Our Anceſtors took great Care that ſuſpicious, and probable Cauſes ſhould not bring any Man's Life and Eſtate into danger; For that reaſon, it was ordain'd by the Stat 37 <hi>Ed</hi> 3. Cap 18. <hi>That ſuch as made ſuggeſtions to the King, ſhould find ſurety to purſue and incur the ſame pain, that the other ſhould have had if he were attainted, in caſe their ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion be not found evil, and that then proceſs of the Law ſhould be made againſt the Accuſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This manner of Proceeding, hath its root on eternal, and univerſal Reaſon: The Law given by God unto his People, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. allotted the ſame Puniſhment unto a falſe witneſs, as a perſon convicted. The beſt diſciplined Nations of the world, learnt this from the Hebrews, and made it their Rule, in the adminiſtration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. The <hi>Grecians</hi> generally obſerved it, and the <hi>Romans,</hi> according to their <hi>Lex Talio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> did not only puniſh death with death, but the intention of committing Murther by falſe Accuſations, with the ſame ſeverity, as if it had been effected by any other means. This Law was inviolably obſerved as long as any thing of regularity or equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty remained amongſt them; and when through the wickedneſs of ſome of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, or their favourites, it came to be overthrown, all Juſtice periſhed with it. A Crew of falſe Informers brake out to the deſtruction of the beſt men, and never ceas'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they had ruined all the moſt eminent and antient Families: Circumvented the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that by their Reputation, Wealth, Birth or Virtue deſerved to be diſtinguiſhed from the common ſort of People, and brought deſolation, upon that victorious City. <hi>Tacitus</hi> complains of this,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tac. Ann.</hi> 3.</note> as the cauſe of all the miſchiefs ſuffered in his Time, and Country.</p>
            <p>By their means the moſt Savage Cruelties, were committed under the name of Law, which thereby became a greater Plague, than formerly Crimes had been: No remedy could be found, when thoſe <hi>Delatores,</hi> whom he calls, <hi>genus hominum Publico exitio repertum,

            <p>The like hath been ſeen in many places, and the domeſtick quiet, which is now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in the Principal parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> proceeds chiefly from this, that every man knows the ſame Puniſhment is appointed for a falſe Accuſation, and proved Crime.</p>
            <p>It is hardly ſeven years ſince Monſieur <hi>Courboyer,</hi> a man of quality in <hi>Brittany,</hi> ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned two of the King of <hi>France</hi> his Guards, to ſwear Treaſonable Deſigns againſt <hi>La Motte,</hi> a <hi>Norman</hi> Gentleman; the matter being brought to Monſieur <hi>Colbert,</hi> he caus'd the Accuſed Perſon and the Witneſſes to be ſecured, until the fraud was diſcovered by one of them, whereupon he was pardoned; <hi>La Motte</hi> releaſed: <hi>Courboyer</hi> beheaded, and the other falſe Witneſs hanged by the Sentence of the Parliament of <hi>Paris.</hi> Though this Law ſeems to be grounded upon ſuch foundation, as forbids us to queſtion the equity of it, our Anceſtors (for Reaſons beſt known unto themſelves) thought fit to moderate its Severity, by the Statute of 38 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 9. yet then it was enacted, and the Law continues in force unto this day; <hi>That whoſoever made complaints to the King, and could not prove them againſt the Defendant,</hi> by the proceſs of Law limited in former Statures, which is firſt by a Grand Jury, he <hi>ſhould be impriſoned until he had made gree to the Party of his damages, and of the ſlander he ſuffered by ſuch occaſion, and after ſhall make fine and ranſom to the King,</hi> which is for the common damage, that the King and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48501:132"/>his People ſuffer by ſuch a falſe accuſation and defamation of any Subject: And in the 42 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. <hi>To eſchew the Miſchiefs and damage done by falſe Accuſers.</hi> 'Tis enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That <hi>no man be put to anſwer</hi> ſuch ſuggeſtions <hi>without preſentment before the Juſtices, i. e.</hi> by the Grand Jury: It cannot ſurely be imagined, that the ſuggeſtions made to the King and his Council, had no probability in them, Or that there was no colour, cauſe, or Reaſon for the King to put the party to anſwer the Accuſation, but the grievance and complaint was, that the People ſuffered certain damage, and vexation upon untrue, and at beſt, uncertain accuſations, and that therein the Law was perverted by the King and his Councils taking upon them, to judge of the certainty, or Truth of them, which of right belonged to the Grand Jury only, upon whoſe Judgment and Integrity our Law doth wholly rely, for the indemnity of the Innocent, and the puniſhment of all ſuch as do unjuſtly moleſt them.</p>
            <p>Our Laws have not thought fit ſo abſolutely to depend upon the Oaths of Witneſſes, as to allow, that upon Two, or Ten mens ſwearing poſitively Treaſon or Felony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any Man, before the Juſtices of Peace, or all the Judges, or before the King and his Council, that the party accuſed, be he either Peer of the Realm, or Commoner, ſhould without further Inquiry be thereupon arraigned, and put upon his Tryal for his Life: Yet none can doubt but there is ſomething of probability in ſuch depoſitions ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs the Law Refers thoſe matters unto Grand Juries, and no man can be brought to Tryal, until upon ſuch ſtrict inquiries, (as is before ſaid) the Indictment be found. The Law is ſo ſtrict in theſe Inquiries, that tho the Crime be never ſo notorious, nay if Treaſon ſhould be confeſſed in Writing under Hand and Seal, before Juſtices of Peace, Secretaries of State, or the King and Council, yet before the party can be arraigned for it, the Grand Jury muſt inquire, and be ſatisfied, whether ſuch a Confeſſion be clear and certain: Whether there was no colluſion therein: Or the party induced to ſuch confeſſion by promiſe of pardon: Or that ſome pretended partakers in the Crime may be defamed, or deſtroyed thereby; they muſt inquire, whether the Confeſſion was not extorted by fear, threatnings, or force, and whether the party was truly <hi>Compos mentis,</hi> of ſound Mind, and Reaſon at that Time.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Stat.</hi> 5 <hi>Eliz. Cap.</hi> 1. declares the antient Common Law concerning the Truſt and Duty of Juries, and Enacts that none ſhould <hi>be indicted for aſſiſting, aiding, comforting, or abetting</hi> Criminals in the Treaſons therein made and declared, <hi>unleſs he, or they be thereof lawfully accuſed by ſuch good and ſufficient Teſtimony or Proof, as by the Jury, by whom he ſhall be indicted, ſhall be thought good, lawful, and ſufficient to prove him, or them guilty of the ſaid Offences.</hi> Herein is declared, the only True Reaſon of Indictments, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Grand Juries Judgment that they have ſuch Teſtimonies as they eſteem ſufficient to prove the party indicted guilty of the Crimes whereof he is accuſed, and whatſoever the Indictment doth contain, they are to preſent no more, or other Crimes, than are proved to their ſatisfaction, as upon Oath they declare it is, when they preſent it. This exactneſs is not only required in the Subſtance of Crimes, but in the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and any doubtfulneſs, or uncertainty in them makes the Indictment, and all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings upon it by the Petit Jury, to be inſufficient, and void, and holden for none, as appears by the following Caſes.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Young</hi>'s Caſe in the Lord <hi>Cook's</hi> Reports, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Fol.</hi> 40. An Indictment for Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was declared void for its incertainty, becauſe the Jury had not layed certainty, in what part of the body the mortal wound was given, ſaying only, that 'twas about his breaſt, the words were <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nam Plagam mortalem circitur pectus.</hi> In like manner in <hi>Vaux</hi> Caſe <hi>Cooks</hi> Rep. <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Fol.</hi> 44. he being indicted for poiſoning <hi>Ridley,</hi> the Jury had not plainly and expreſly averred that <hi>Ridley</hi> drank the Poiſon, tho' other words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd it, and thereupon the Indictment was judged inſufficient, <hi>for</hi> (ſaith the Book) <hi>the matter of an Indictment ought to be full, expreſs, and certain, and ſhall not be maintained by argument or implication, for that the Indictment is found by the Oath of the Neighbourhood.</hi> In the 2d part of <hi>Rolls</hi> Reports <hi>p.</hi> 263. <hi>Smith</hi> and <hi>Malls</hi> Caſe the Indictment was quaſhed for incertainty, becauſe the Jury had averred that <hi>Smith</hi> was either a Servant or Deputy, <hi>Smith exiſtens ſervus ſive deputatus,</hi> are the words: It was doubtleſs probably enough proved to the Jury, that he was either a Deputy, or Servant, but becauſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment did not abſolutely and certainly aver his condition either of Servant, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, it was declared void: If there be any defect of certainty in the Grand Juries Verdict, no Proof or Evidence to the Petit Jury can ſupply it, ſo it was judged in <hi>Wrote</hi> and <hi>Wigs</hi> Caſe <hi>Coke</hi> 4. Rep. <hi>Fol.</hi> 45, 46, 47. It was layed, that <hi>Wrote</hi> was killed at <hi>Shipperton,</hi> but did not aver that <hi>Shipperton</hi> was within the <hi>Verge,</hi> tho in truth it was, and no Averment or Oath to the Petit Jury, could ſupply that ſmall faileur of certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſupport the Indictment; and the reaſon is rendred in theſe words, <hi>viz. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment being Veredictum id eſt dictum Veritatis a Verdict.</hi> That is, <hi>a ſaying of Truth and matter of Record, ought to contain the whole Truth which is requiſite by the Law, for when
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:48501:133"/>it doth not appear, 'tis the ſame, as if it were not, and every material part of the Indictment ought to be found upon the Oath of the Indicters, and cannot be ſupplied by the Averment of the Party.</hi> The Grand Juries Verdict is the foundation of all judicial proceeding againſt Capital Offenders (at the King's ſuit) if that fail in any point of certainty, both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions and acquittals thereupon are utterly void, and the proceedings againſt both may begin again, as if they had never been tried, as it appears in the Caſe laſt cited, <hi>Fol.</hi> 47.</p>
            <p>Now as the Law requires from the Grand Jury particular, certain, and preciſe affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of Truth, ſo it expects that they ſhould look for the like, and accept of no other from ſuch as bring accuſations to them. For no Man can certainly affirm that which is uncertainly delivered unto him, or which he doth not firmly believe. The Witneſſes that they receive for good, are to depoſe only abſolute certainties about the Facts committed, That is, what they have ſeen, or heard from the accuſed parties themſelves, not what others have told them; They are not to be ſuffered to make probable arguments, and infer from thence the guilt of the accuſed; Their depoſitions ought to be poſitive, plain, direct, and full: The Crime is to be ſworn without any doubtfulneſs or obſcurity; Not in words qualified, and limited to belief, conceptions, or apprehenſions. This abſolute certainty required in the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Witneſſes, is one principal ground of the Juries moſt rational aſſurance of the Truth of their Verdict: The credit alſo of the Witneſſes ought to be free from all blemiſh, that good and Conſcientious Men may rationally rely upon them, in matters of ſo great moment, as the blood of a Man. It muſt alſo be certainly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that all the matters which they depoſe, are conſiſtent with each other, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſuch Circumſtances, as in their Judgment render it credible: All juſt Indictments muſt be built upon theſe moral aſſurances, which the wiſdom of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions hath deviſed as the beſt, and only way of deciding Controverſies; Neither can a Grand Jury Man, who ſwears to preſent nothing but the Truth, be ſatisfied with leſs.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſcarce credible that any learned in our Laws, ſhould tell a Grand Jury that a far leſs Evidence will warrant their Indictment (being but an Accuſation) than the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit Jury ought to have for their Verdict. Both of them do in like manner plainly and poſitively affirm upon their Oaths, the Truth of the Accuſation; Their Verdicts are indeed one and the ſame in ſubſtance, and ſence, tho' not in words. There is no real difference between affirming in writing, that an Indictment of Treaſon is true, as is the practice of Grand Juries, and ſaying that the party tried thereupon is guilty of the Treaſon whereof he is indicted, as is the courſe of Petit Juries: They are both upon their Oaths; they are equally obligatory unto both, the one therefore muſt expect the ſame proof for their ſatisfaction as the other, and as clear Evidence muſt be required for an Indictment, as for a Verdict: It is unreaſonable to think that a ſlighter proof ſhould ſatisfie the Conſciences of the greater Jury, than is requiſite to convince the leſs, and uncharitable to imagine, that thoſe ſhould not be as ſenſible as the others of the Sacred ſecurity they have given by Oath, to do nothing in their Offices but according to truth.</p>
            <p>If there ought to be any difference in the Proceedings of the Grand and Petit Juries, the greater exactneſs and diligence ſeems to be required in the Grand: For as the ſame work of finding out the truth in order to the doing of Juſtice is allotted unto both, the greateſt part of the burthen ought to lye upon them that have the beſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of performing it. The invalidity, weakneſs, or defects of the Proofs may be equally evident to either of them: But if there be deceit in ſtifling true Teſtimonies, or malice in ſuborning wicked Perſons, to bring in ſuch as are falſe, the Grand Jury may moſt eaſily, nay probably, can only diſcover it. They are not ſtraitned in time; they may freely examine in private, without interruption from the Council, or Court, ſuch Witneſſes as are preſented unto them, or they ſhall think fit to call; they may joyntly or ſeverally enquire of their Friends or Acquaintance after the Lives and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Witneſſes, or the accuſed Perſons, and all circumſtances relating unto the matter in queſtion, and conſult together under the Seal of Secrecy: On the other ſide the Petty Jury being charged with the Priſoner, acts in open Court under the awe of the Judges, is ſubject to be diſturb'd, or interrupted by Council; deprived of all opportunity of conſulting one another until the Evidence be ſumm'd up, and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to eat or drink until they bring in a Verdict; ſo it is almoſt impoſſible for them thus limited to diſcover ſuch evil practices as may be uſed for, or againſt the Priſoner, by Subornation or Perjury to pervert Juſtice; if therefore the Grand Jury be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to perform this part of their duty, it is hard to imagine how it ſhould be done at all: And it is much more inconceivable how they can ſatisfie their Conſciences, if they ſo neglect, as to find a Bill upon an imperfect Evidence, in the abſence of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:48501:133"/>in expectation that it will be ſupplied at the Bar: It concerns them therefore to remember, that if they proceed upon ſuch uncertainties, they will certainly give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable wounds into their Neighbours Reputations, in order unto the deſtruction of their Perſons.</p>
            <p>Whatever ground this Doctrine of Indicting upon ſlight proofs may have got in our days, it is (as we have ſeen) both againſt Law and Reaſon, and contrary to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of former times. My Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in his <hi>Comment</hi> on <hi>Weſtm.</hi> 2d. tells us, <hi>That in thoſe days (and as yet it ought to be) Indictments taken in the Abſence of the Party were formed upon plain and direct Proofs, and not upon Probabilities and Inferences.</hi> Herein we ſee, that the practice of our Fore-Fathers, and the opinion of this great and judicious Lawyer, were directly againſt this new Doctrine, and ſome that have carefully looked back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, obſerved, that there are very few Examples of men acquitted by Petit Juries, becauſe Grand Juries of old were ſo wary in canvaſing every thing narrowly, and ſo ſenſible of their Duty, in proceeding according unto truth upon ſatisfactory Evidence, that few or none were brought unto Trial till their guilt ſeemed evident.</p>
            <p>It is therefore a great miſtake to think that the ſecond Juries were inſtituted for the hearing of fuller proofs, that was not their work, but to give an opportunity to the accuſed perſons to anſwer for themſelves, and make their defence, which cannot be thought to ſtrengthen the Evidence, unleſs they be ſuppoſed to play booty againſt their own Lives. By way of anſwer the Priſoner may avoid the Charge: He is permitted to take exceptions; he may demur or plead to the Indictments in points of Law: Herein the Judges ought to aſſiſt him, and appoint Councel if he deſire it: He may ſhew that the Indictors, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Grand Jury, or ſome of them, are not lawful men, or not lawfully returned by the Sheriffs; embracery or practice may be proved in the packing of the Jury: A Conſpiracy or Subornation may be diſcovered; falſhood may be found out in the Witneſſes, by queſtions about ſome circumſtances that none could have asked, or imagined, except the party accuſed: And beſides doing right to the Indicted, in theſe and many other things, 'tis the Peoples due to have all the Evidence firſt taken in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, to be afterwards made publick at the Trial, that the Kingdom may be ſatisfied in the equal adminiſtration of Juſtice, and that the Judgments againſt Criminals may be of greater terrour, and more uſeful to preſerve the common peace.</p>
            <p>If any object that this Doctrine would introduce double Trials for every offence, and all the delays that accompany them, it may be anſwered, That <hi>Nulla unquam de morte hominis cunctatio Longa eſt.</hi> Ju. Sat. No delay is to be eſteemed long, when the life of a man is in queſtion. The puniſhment of an Offender that is a little deferred, may be compenſated by its ſeverity, but blood raſhly ſpilt cannot be gathered up, and a Land polluted by it, is hardly cleanſed. Wiſe and good men in matters of this nature have ever proceeded with extream caution, whilſt the ſwift of foot are in the Scripture repreſented under an ill Character, and have been often found in their haſte to draw more guilt upon themſelves, than what they pretended to chaſtize in others. To a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void this miſchief, in many well poliſhed Kingdoms, ſeveral Courts of Juſtice are inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, who take cognizance of the ſame facts, but ſo ſubordinate unto one another, that in matters of life, limb, liberty, or other important caſes, there is a right of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal from the inferiour, before which it is firſt brought, to the Superiour; where this is wanting, means have been found to give opportunity unto the Judges to reflect upon their own ſentences, that if any thing had been done raſhly, or through miſtake, it might be corrected, man, even in his beſt eſtate, ſeeming to have need of ſome ſuch helps. <hi>Tiberius Caeſar</hi> was never accuſed of too much lenity, but when he heard that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius Priſcus</hi> had been accuſed of Treaſon before the Senate, condemned, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately put to death, <hi>Tam praecipites deprecatus eſt poenas,</hi> He deſired that ſuch ſudden pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment might for the future be forborn, and a Law was thereupon made, <hi>That no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Senate ſhould in leſs than ten days be tranſmitted to the Treaſury,</hi> before which time it could not be executed, <hi>Tac. An.</hi> 3. Matters of this nature concerning every man in <hi>England,</hi> it is not to be doubted but our Anceſtors conſider'd them, and our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, neither admitting of ſubordinate Judicatures, from whence appeals may be made, nor giving opportunities unto Juries to re-examine their Verdicts, after they were given, they could not find a way more ſuitable unto the rules of Wiſdom, Juſtice, and Mercy, than to appoint two Juries with equal care, according unto different methods, the one in private, and at leiſure, the other publickly in the preſence of the party, and more ſpeedy to paſs upon every man, ſo as none can be condemned, unleſs he be thought guilty by them both, and it cannot be imagined that ſo little time, as is uſually ſpent in Trials at the Bar, before a Petit Jury, ſhould be allowed unto one that pleads for his life, or unto them who are to be ſatisfied in their Conſciences, unleſs it were preſumed that the Grand Jury had ſo well examined, prepared, and digeſted the matter, that the other may proceed more ſuccinctly, without danger of error.</p>
            <pb n="252" facs="tcp:48501:134"/>
            <p>Therefore let the Grand Juries faithfully perform their high Truſt, and neither be cheated nor frighted from their Duty: Let them purſue the good old way, ſince no Innovation can be brought in, that will not turn to the prejudice of the accuſed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and themſelves: Let them not be deluded with frivolous Arguments, ſo as to invalidate a conſiderable part of our Law, and render themſelves inſignificant ciphers, in expectation that Petit Juries will repair the faults they commit, ſince that would be no leſs than to ſlight one of the beſt fences that the Law provides for our Lives and Liberties, and very much to weaken the other.</p>
            <p>When a Grand Jury finds a Bill againſt any perſon, they do all that in them lies to take away his Life, if the crime be capital, and it is ridiculous for them to pretend they relie upon the virtue of the Petit Jury, if they ſhew none themſelves. They cannot reaſonably hope the other ſhould be more tender of the Priſoners concernments, more exact in doing Juſtice, or more careful in examining the Credit of the Witneſſes, when they have not only neglected their duty of ſearching into it, but added ſtrength unto their Teſtimony by finding a Bill upon it.</p>
            <p>They cannot poſſibly be exempted from the blame of conſenting (at the leaſt) unto the miſchiefs that may enſue, unleſs they uſe all the honeſt care that the Law allows to prevent them; nor conſequently avoid the ſtain of the blood that may be ſhed by their omiſſion, ſince it could not have been, if they had well performed their part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they found the Indictment, whereby the party is expoſed to ſo many diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that it is hard for the cleareſt Innocence to defend it ſelf againſt them.</p>
            <p>But when the one and the other Jury act as they ought, with courage, diligence, and indifference, we ſhall have juſt reaſon, with the wiſe Lord Chancellour <hi>Forteſcue,</hi> to celebrate that Law that inſtituted them. To congratulate with our Country men the happineſs we enjoy,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fort. de laud. Leg.

                  <p>
                     <hi>How many Free-men of this Land, faithful Subjects of our Lord the King, have like the meaneſt Slaves of loweſt condition, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fault been caſt into Priſon, where ſome of them by hunger, grief, or the burthen of their chains have expired, they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo extorted at their pleaſure infinite ſums of

               <p>
                  <hi>Dear People, dear Proteſtants, and dear Country-men,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Have been Accuſed and Convicted for Treaſon, the Laws Adjudge me to this Death, and I come hither willingly to ſubmit to it. I pray God forgive all thoſe perſons that had any hand in it. I do declare to you, whatever has been ſaid of me, that I was never a Papiſt, or ever that way inclined; they have done me wrong: I was ever a Proteſtant, I was born a Proteſtant, I have lived ſo, and ſo by the Grace of God I will die, of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> according to the beſt Reformation of the Church from all Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, from all Superſtition, or any thing that is contrary to the Goſpel of our bleſſed Lord and Saviour. I do declare, I was never in any Popiſh Service, Prayers, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, in my life, ſave one time about ſeventeen or eighteen years ago, as near as I remember, I was out of a curioſity one afternoon at St. <hi>James</hi>'s Chappel, the Queens Chappel at St. <hi>James</hi>'s; except that one time, I never did hear any Popiſh Service, any thing of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> Maſs or Prayers, or any thing elſe, private or publick.</p>
               <p>I know you expect that I ſhould ſay ſomething as to what I die for. It has been charged upon me: when I was apprehended and brought before the Council, ſome of the Council, the Secretary, and my Lord <hi>Killingworth,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Seymour,</hi> they told me there was Treaſon ſworn againſt me; truly they ſurprized me when they ſaid ſo: for of all things in the World, I thought my ſelf as free from that as any man. I ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them if any man living had the confidence to ſwear Treaſon againſt me? They ſaid ſeveral, three or four as I remember. Then they told me, it was ſworn againſt me, that I had a deſign to pull the King out of <hi>White-hall,</hi> and to ſerve him as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was ſerved, or to that purpoſe, the Loggerhead his Father, or that kind of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. I did deny it then, and do now deny it upon my Death. I never was in any manner of Plot in my days, neither one way nor another, never knew any ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, nor ever had ſuch Communication with any man hitherto. I know of no Plot in the World but the Popiſh Plot, and that every man may know as much as I. If I had had ſuch a deſign as theſe men have ſworn againſt me, to have ſeiz'd his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty either at <hi>London,</hi> or this place at <hi>Oxford;</hi> I take God to witneſs, as I'm a dying man, and upon the terms of my Salvation, I know not any one man upon the face of the Earth that would have ſtood by me; and how likely it was that I ſhould do ſuch a thing my ſelf, let the whole World judge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſwears, That I ſpoke Treaſon to him, treaſonable words in the Coffee-houſe, and in the Barbers ſhop by the Angel, even he could not pretend to ſee me any where elſe; but it is falſe, and a very unlikely thing, that I ſhould ſpeak Treaſon to him. I muſt confeſs I was in his company at the Coffee-houſe and that Barbers ſhop, before I went out of Town, but there could be no Communication between us; for he was writing at one end of the Room and eating a piece of bread, and I lighted a Pipe of Tobacco at the other end, and took it, till Sir <hi>Tho. Player</hi> and Sir <hi>Rob. Clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> came to me, and we went to my Lord <hi>Lovelace</hi>'s out of Town that night: ſo when they came we took horſe and went out of Town with the reſt.</p>
               <p>For my part, I can't ſum up my Witneſſes. I was under moſt ſtrange Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as ever any man was; I was kept Priſoner ſo cloſe in the <hi>Tower,</hi> that I could have no Converſation with any, though I was certain the Popiſh Lords had it every day there, but I could have none: I could not tell the Witneſſes that were to ſwear againſt me; I could not tell what it was they ſwore againſt me, for I could have no Copy of the Indictment, nor no way poſſible to make any preparation to make my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as I ought to have done, and might have done by Law, I had no liberty to do any thing, as I am a dying man.</p>
               <p>And as to what <hi>Dugdale, Smith, Turbervile,</hi> and <hi>Heyns</hi> ſwore againſt me, they did ſwear ſuch Treaſon, that nothing but a mad man would ever have truſted any body
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:48501:136"/>with, and leaſt of all to Papiſts; every one of them that had been concerned with Plots and Treaſons among their own party, and under the greateſt Tyes and Obligations of Damnation, and to be Sainted if they kept it ſecret, and to be damned if they reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. If theſe men will not keep things ſecret for their own Party, how could I truſt them? I take God to witneſs, and do freely acknowledge, I have ſought my God with Tears ſeveral times, to inform me if ſo be I had with any word tranſgreſſed at any time. I knew not of any part of what they ſwore againſt me, till ſuch time as I heard it ſwore againſt me at the Bar. This is very hard, Gentlemen, but this is the Truth.</p>
               <p>And there be a great many other ſtrange Reports that I have heard ſince I have been a Priſoner, That I ſhould be a means to convert the Counteſs of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> by bringing one <hi>Thompſon</hi> a Prieſt to her. Truly all that I was concerned in was, ſome fifteen or ſixteen years ago I lodged at Col. <hi>Vernon</hi>'s that married my Lady <hi>Brookes:</hi> The Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were Papiſts, the <hi>Brookes</hi> were Papiſts, and there was this <hi>Thompſon;</hi> and I did ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him a Prieſt in the Houſe, though I never ſaw him at Popiſh Service or Worſhip, though I was there half a year; but coming afterwards to my Lord <hi>Rocheſter</hi>'s about ſome buſineſs I had to do for him and ſeveral other perſons of Quality, he ſent for me one afternoon from the Parſonage in <hi>Adderbury</hi> to his Houſe, and his Lady and he ſtood together: He ſent to me and ask'd me if my Horſe were at home: ſaid he, I would have you carry this Letter to Mr. <hi>Thompſon,</hi> if you are at leiſure this afternoon: My Lord, I am at leiſure to ſerve you. So I took a Letter from his hand, and his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's too, as I remember (he made an offer that way) ſealed with his own Seal, and carried it to <hi>Thompſon,</hi> and delivered it to him; and he told me that he would wait upon my Lord, for it was for ſome Lands my Lord did offer to raiſe Money for ſome occaſions. This is the Truth of that Scandal.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, that I had a Prieſt ſeveral years in my Houſe, <hi>viz. Serjeant</hi> that came over from <hi>Holland</hi> to diſcover: About ſome ten years ago, that very ſame man came to me, but was a ſtranger to me, and he came to me by the name of Dr. <hi>Smith</hi> a Phyſician: and there was an Apothecary in the <hi>Old-baily,</hi> and a Linnen-draper within <hi>Ludgate,</hi> that came with him: they brought him thither and took a Chamber, and lay about half a year or three quarters, at times, by the name of Dr. <hi>Smith,</hi> and as a Phyſician. This is the Truth of that, and no otherwiſe. This is the Entertainment of <hi>Serjeant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the occaſion of my coming to <hi>Oxford,</hi> I do ſay, was voluntary. The Parliament-men laſt Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and ſeveral Lords, dined together the day before they ſate: the laſt Seſſions of Parliament at <hi>Wiſtminſter</hi> they ſent for me to the Sun-Tavern behind the <hi>Exchange;</hi> and when I came, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and ſeveral Lords were together, and I believe above a hundred Parliament-men of the Commons. The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> called me to him, and told me, he had heard a good Report of me, and that I was an honeſt man, and one that may be truſted; and they did not know but their Enemies the Papiſts might have ſome deſign to ſerve them as they did in King <hi>James</hi>'s time, by Gun-powder, or any other ways: And the Duke with ſeveral Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, did deſire me to uſe my utmoſt skill in ſearching all places ſuſpected by them; which I did perform, and from thence I had, as I think, the popular name of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Joyner,</hi> becauſe they had intruſted me before any man in <hi>England</hi> to do that Office.</p>
               <p>The ſame <hi>Haynes,</hi> one of them that ſwore againſt me, had diſcovered to me and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others, as to <hi>Macknamar</hi> and his Brother, and this <hi>Ivy,</hi> who are now all of another ſtamp, That the Parliament was to be deſtroyed at <hi>Oxford;</hi> and that there was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to murther my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> by <hi>Fitzgerald</hi> and his Party; and that they did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to bring <hi>Macknamar</hi> over to him, and ſaid, Then it would be well with him; and they would not be long before they had <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s life. And he made Depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this to Sir <hi>Geo. Treby,</hi> as I heard afterwards; for I was not with him when it was ſworn. I wiſh the Commons of <hi>England</hi> as well as I wiſh my own heart; and I did not underſtand, but when I ſerv'd the Parliament, I ſerv'd his Majeſty too; and let them be miſerable that make the Difference between them; for my part I never did.</p>
               <p>I came to <hi>Oxford</hi> with my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> whom I look upon to be a very honeſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentleman, my Lord <hi>Clare,</hi> my Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Huntingdon;</hi> and this Capt. <hi>Brown</hi> and Don <hi>Lewis</hi> were in my company, and came along with us as they were my Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s Friends. <hi>Brown</hi> I have known I believe two or three months, but <hi>Lewis</hi> I never ſaw before that day; they ſaid they came with my Lord <hi>Howard.</hi> I take God to witneſs, I never had but one ſixpence or any thing elſe, to carry on any deſign; and if it were to ſave my life now, I can't charge any man in the world with any deſign againſt the Government, as God is my witneſs, or againſt his Majeſty, or any other perſon.</p>
               <p>As for what Arms I had, and what Arms others had, they were for our own defence, in caſe the Papiſts ſhould make any attempt upon us by way of Maſſacre, or any Invaſion or Rebellion, that we ſhould be ready to defend our ſelves. God is my witneſs this is all I know: If this be a Plot, this I was in; but in no other. But never knew of any
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:48501:136"/>numbers or times appointed for meeting; but we ſaid one to another, that the Papiſts had a Deſign againſt the Proteſtants, when we did meet, as I was a man of general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; and in caſe they ſhould riſe, we were ready: but then they ſhould begin the Attempt upon us. This was my buſineſs, and is the buſineſs of every good Subject that loves the Laws of his Country and his King: For <hi>England</hi> can never hope to be happy under thoſe Blood-thirſty men, whoſe Religion is Blood and Murther; which I do with all my Soul, and did ever ſince I knew what Religion was, abhor and deteſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as pernicious and deſtructive to humane Societies, and all Government.</p>
               <p>I beſeech God, that every Man of you may unite together as Proteſtants againſt this common Foe. <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> it is my ſence, and I do in that believe I am as certainly murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the hands of the Papiſts as Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> himſelf was, though the thing is not ſeen. Theſe Witneſſes certainly are mercenary men, and I beſeech God Almighty to have mercy upon their Souls, and forgive them; and either by his Judgments or mercies reclaim them, that they ſhed no more innocent blood: There is not a man of them that I know of, that ever heard me ſay or do any bit of Treaſon in my life. This is (the firſt I mayn't ſay it is) but almoſt the twentieth Sham-Plot that they have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to put upon the Nation, to delude the People, and put off their own damnable Plot. This is not the firſt, but I think the ſixteenth or ſeventeenth; I pray God that my blood may be the laſt. I pray God defend every man's blood, and all Proteſtants in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> from the hand of theſe bloody Papiſts, by whoſe means I die this Death; and if they ſhall go on in this nature, I hope the good God will open every mans eyes to ſee it before he feels it: And I beſeech you, if you have any love for your King, your Country, and the Proteſtants, unite together, if you are Proteſtants. I pray God, thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the name, let them be called how they will, either Diſſenters, or Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> men, that they may unite together like men, like Chriſtians, againſt the common Foe, who will ſpare neither the one ſide nor the other, but beat you one againſt another like two Pitchers, the laſt that ſtands they will certainly deſtroy if they can. This is my ſence, and God is my witneſs, I ſpeak my Conſcience. I do not know, Mr. <hi>Sheriff,</hi> whether there be any thing elſe I have to ſay, or no. We have a good God, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech every man that hears me this day (for we live in a ſinful Age, good People, and it behoveth every one of you, it cannot be long before all that look upon me in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, muſt lie down in the Duſt, and God knows, muſt come into an eternal eſtate either for Mercy or Judgment) I beſeech you in the name of God, he is a God of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and a God of Patience, and long ſuffering, that you would break off your Sins by Repentance, and ſerve a good God, who muſt be your Friend at laſt, or elſe you are loſt to Eternity.</p>
               <p>O Lord, how ungrateful wretches are we, that have a God of ſuch infinite Mercy and goodneſs, that affords us our Life, our Health, and a thouſand Mercies every day; and we like ungrateful People, not deſerving the name of Men or Chriſtians, live riotous lives, in Debauchery and Swearing, in Malice, and the Lord knows how many Evils. I beſeech God that I may be this day a means in the hand of God to bring ſome of their Souls over to him. I beſeech you remember what I ſay. Indeed I do not know, I have been ſo ſtrangely uſed ſince I have been a Priſoner, what to ſay, being brought from one Affliction to another, that my Body is worn out, and my Memory and Intellects have failed me much, to what they were; I can't remember what I have to ſay more, but that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt would bleſs my Country, and preſerve it from Popery; and in mercy bleſs his Majeſty: good God be merciful to him, make him an inſtrument in thy hands to defend his Proteſtant Subjects; Lord, in mercy defend him from his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; good God bleſs this People; good Lord continue the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, thy Goſpel, in its purity, to us and our Poſterity, as long as the Sun and Moon endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. O Lord, ſave all that call upon thee, be merciful to all thy Servants, all thy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that put their truſt in thee, good Lord deliver them from the hands of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: good Lord, let their Lives, and Bodies, and Souls, be all precious in thy ſight. O merciful God, put a ſtop to theſe moſt wicked Conſpiracies of thy Enemies, and the Nations Enemies, the Papiſts; let no more Proteſtant blood be ſhed but this of mine, I beſeech thee, O my God. O Lord look upon me; O Lord bleſs me, O good God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me into thy bleſſed preſence by Jeſus Chriſt my alone Saviour and Redeemer, in whom alone I put my truſt for Salvation: It is thee, O God, that I truſt in, thou righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judge of Heaven and Earth. All Popery, all Pardons, all Popes and Prieſts, all Diſpenſations I diſown, and will not go out of the World with a lye in my mouth. From the ſincerity of my heart, I declare again, that what I've ſaid to you, is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sentiments of my Soul, as God ſhall have mercy upon me, and to the beſt of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>I deſire the Prayers of you, good People, while I am here: and once more I beſeech you to think upon Eternity, every one of you that hear me this day; the Lord turn
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:48501:137"/>your Hearts and Souls, if you have been wicked livers, if you do live wicked lives, the Lord in mercy convert you: and ſhew you your danger: for I as little thought to come to this, as any man that hears me this day, and I bleſs God, I have no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it from the hands of men, than the Child that ſucks at his Mothers breaſt, I bleſs my God for it. I do ſay, I have been a ſinner againſt my God, and he hath learned me Grace ever ſince I have been a Priſoner. I bleſs my God for a Priſon; I bleſs my God for Afflictions: I bleſs my God that ever I was reſtrain'd: for I never knew my ſelf till he had taken me out of the World. Therefore you that have your liberties, time, and precious opportunities, be up, and be doing for God and for your Souls, every one of you.</p>

                  <hi>To his Son.</hi> Where is my dear Child?</p>
               <p>Mr. Sheriff. <hi>I made one requeſt to you, you gave me an imperfect Anſwer; you ſaid you were of the beſt Reformed Church in the world, the Church of</hi> England, <hi>according to the beſt Reformation in the world. I deſire you for the ſatisfaction of the world, to declare what Church that is, whether Presbyterian, or Independant, or the Church of</hi> England, <hi>or what.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Colledge.</hi> Good Mr. Sheriff, for your ſatisfaction, for 20 years and above I was under the Presbyterian Miniſtry, till his Majeſties Reſtauration; then I was conformable to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when that was reſtored, and ſo continued till ſuch time as I ſaw Perſecution upon the Diſſenting People, and undue things done in their Meeting-places; then I went among them to know what kind of people thoſe were, and I take God to witneſs, ſince that time I have uſed their Meetings, <hi>viz.</hi> the presbyterians, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers very ſeldom, and the Church of <hi>England.</hi> I did hear Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> not above three weeks before I was taken. I heard the Church of <hi>England</hi> as frequently as I heard the Diſſenters, and never had any prejudice, God is my witneſs, againſt either, but always heartily deſired that they might unite, and be Lovers and Friends, and I had no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice againſt any man; and truly I am afraid that it is not for the Nations good, that there ſhould be ſuch Heart-burnings between them: That ſome of the Church of <hi>England</hi> will preach, that the Presbyterians are worſe than the Papiſts. God doth know that what I ſay, I ſpeak freely from my heart, I have found many among them truly ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, and ſo I have of all the reſt that have come into my company; Men without any manner of Deſign but to ſerve God, ſerve his Majeſty, and keep their Liberties and Properties; men that I am certain are not of vicious lives: I found no Dammers or thoſe kind of People amongſt them, or at leaſt few of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To his Son, Kiſſing him ſeveral times with great paſſion.</hi> Dear Child Farewell, the Lord have mercy upon thee. Good people, let me have your Prayers to God Almighty to receive my Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And then he Prayed, and as ſoon as he had done, ſpake as followeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord have mercy upon my Enemies, and I beſeech you, good People, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you are, and the whole World that I have offended to forgive me; whomever I have offended in word or deed, I ask every man's pardon, and I forgive the World with all my ſoul, all the Injuries I have received; and I beſeech God Almighty forgive thoſe poor Wretches who have caſt away their ſouls, or at leaſt endangered them, to ruine this body of mine: I beſeech God that they may have a ſight of their Sins, and that they may find mercy at his hands: Let my blood ſpeak the juſtice of my Cauſe.</p>
               <p>I have done: And God have mercy upon you all.</p>
               <p>To Mr. <hi>Croſthwait.</hi> Pray, Sir, my Service to Dr. <hi>Hall,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Reynall,</hi> and thank them for all their kindneſſes to me; I thank you, Sir, for your kindneſs: The Lord bleſs you all. Mr. <hi>Sheriff,</hi> God be with you: God be with you all, good People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Executioner</hi> Ketch <hi>deſired his pardon; and he ſaid,</hi> I do forgive you. The Lord have mercy on my Soul.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I Expected the Noiſe would be ſuch, that I could not be very well heard: I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fond of much ſpeaking, much leſs now; Therefore I have ſet down in this Paper, all that I think fit to leave behind me. God knows how far I was always from Deſigns againſt the King's Perſon, or of altering the Government; and I ſtill pray for the Preſervation of both, and of the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
            <p>I am told, that Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> has ſaid ſome things concerning my knowledge of the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:48501:137"/>Plot: I know not whether the Report is true or not, I hope it is not: For to my knowledg, I never ſaw him, or ſpake with him in my whole Life; and in the Words of a dying Man, I profeſs I know of no Plot, either againſt the King's Life, or the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. But I have now done with this World, and am going to a better. I forgive all the World, and I thank God I die in Charity with all Men; and I wiſh all ſincere Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants may love one another, and not make way for Popery by their Animoſities.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The PAPER deliver'd to the SHERIFFS.</head>
               <p>I Thank God, I find my ſelf ſo compoſed and prepared for death, and my Thoughts ſo fixed on another World, that I hope in God I am now quite weaned from ſetting my heart on this. Yet I cannot forbear now, in ſetting down in Writing a fuller Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my Condition, to be left behind me, than I'll venture to ſay at the place of Execution, in the noiſe and clutter that is like to be there. I bleſs God heartily for thoſe many Bleſſings, which he in his infinite Mercy has beſtowed upon me, through the whole courſe of my Life: That I was born of worthy good Parents, and had the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of a Religious Education, which I have often thank'd God very heartily for, and look'd upon as an invaluable Bleſſing: For even when I minded it leaſt, it ſtill hung about me, and gave me checks, and has now for many years ſo influenced and poſſeſſed me, that I feel the happy Effects of it in this my extremity, in which I have been ſo wonderfully (I thank God) ſupported, that neither my impriſonment, nor the fear of Death, have been able to diſcompoſe me to any degree; but on the contrary, I have found the Aſſurances of the Love and Mercy of God, in and through my bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, in whom only I truſt; and I do not queſtion, but that I am going to partake of that fulneſs of Joy which is in his preſence, the hopes thereof does ſo wonderfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light me, that I reckon this as the happieſt time of my Life, tho' others may look upon it as the ſaddeſt.</p>
               <p>I have lived, and now die of the Reformed Religion, a true and ſincere Proteſtant, and in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> though I could never yet comply with, or riſe up to all the heights of many People. I wiſh with all my Soul, all our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Differences were removed, and that all ſincere Proteſtants would ſo far conſider the Danger of Popery, as to lay aſide their Heats, and agree againſt the Common Enemy, and that the Church-men would be leſs ſevere, and the Diſſenters leſs ſcrupulous: For I think Bitterneſs and Perſecution are at all times bad, but much more now.</p>
               <p>For Popery, I look on it as an Idolatrous and Bloody Religion, and therefore thought my ſelf bound in my ſtation, to do all I could againſt it. And by that I foreſaw I ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſuch great Enemies to my ſelf, and ſo powerful ones, that I have been now for ſome time expecting the worſt. And bleſſed be God, I fall by the Axe, and not by the Fiery Tryal. Yet, whatever apprehenſions I had of Popery, and of my own ſevere and heavy ſhare I was like to have under it, when it ſhould prevail, I never had a thought of doing any thing againſt it baſely, or inhumanely, but what could well conſiſt with the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, and the Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom. And I thank God, I have examin'd all my actings in that matter, with ſo great care, that I can appeal to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, who knows my heart, that I went on ſincerely, without being moved, either by Paſſion, By-ends, or ill-deſign. I have always loved my Country much more than my life; and never had any Deſign of changing the Government, which I value and look upon as one of the beſt Governments in the World, and would always have been ready to venture my life for the preſerving it, and would have ſuffered any Extremity, rather than have conſented to any Deſign to take away the King's Life: Neither ever had Man the impudence to propoſe ſo baſe and barbarous a thing to me. And I look on it as a very unhappy and uneaſy part of my preſent Condition, That in my Indictment there ſhould be ſo much as mention of ſo vile a Fact; tho' nothing in the leaſt was ſaid to prove any ſuch Matter; but the contrary, by the Lord <hi>Howard:</hi> Neither does any body, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, believe the leaſt of it. So that I need not, I think, ſay more.</p>
               <p>For the King, I do ſincerely pray for him, and wiſh well to him, and to the Nation, That they may be happy in one another; that he may be indeed the Defender of the Faith, That the Proteſtant Religion, and the Peace and Safety of the Kingdom may be preſerved, and flouriſh under his Government; and that He in his Perſon may be happy both here, and hereafter.</p>
               <p>As for the ſhare I had in the Proſecution of the Popiſh Plot, I take God to witneſs, That I proceeded in it in the Sincerity of my heart, being then really convinced (as I am ſtill) that there was a Conſpiracy againſt the King, the Nation, and the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: And I likewiſe profeſs, That I never knew any thing, either directly, or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, of any Practice with the Witneſſes; which I look upon as ſo horrid a thing, that I could never have endured it. For, I thank God, Falſhood and Cruelty were never in my Nature, but always the fartheſt from it imaginable. I did believe, and do ſtill, That Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:48501:138"/>is breaking in upon the Nation: and that thoſe who advance it, will ſtop at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to carry on their Deſign, I am heartily ſorry that ſo many Proteſtants give their helping hand to it. But I hope God will preſerve the Proteſtant Religion, and this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Though I am afraid it will fall under very great Tryals, and very ſharp Sufferings. And indeed the Impiety and Prophaneneſs that abounds, and appears ſo ſcandalouſly bare-fac'd every where, gives too juſt reaſon to fear the worſt things which can befall a People. I pray God prevent it, and give thoſe who have ſhew'd Concern for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good, and who have appear'd hearty for the true Intereſt of the Nation, and the Proteſtant Religion, Grace to live ſo, that they may not caſt a reproach on that which they endeavour to advance; which (God knows) has often given me many ſad thoughts. And I hope ſuch of my Friends as may think they are touch'd by this, will not take what I ſay in ill part, but endeavour to amend their ways, and live ſuitable to the Rules of the true Reformed Religion, which is the only thing can adminiſter true Comfort at the latter end, and revive a man when he comes to Dye.</p>
               <p>As for my preſent Condition, I bleſs God, I have no repining in my heart at it. I know for my Sins I have deſerved much worſe at the hands of God; ſo that I chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubmit to ſo ſmall a Puniſhment, as the being taken off a few years ſooner, and the being made a Spectacle to the World. I do freely forgive all the World, particularly thoſe concerned in taking away my life: and I deſire and conjure my Friends to think of no Revenge, but to ſubmit to the holy Will of God, into whoſe Hands I reſign my ſelf entirely.</p>
               <p>But to look back a little, I cannot but give ſome touch about the Bill of Excluſion, and ſhew the Reaſons of my appearing in that Buſineſs, which in ſhort is this: That I thought the Nation was in ſuch danger of Popery, and that the expectation of a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor</hi> (as I have ſaid in Parliament) put the King's life likewiſe in ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that I ſaw no way ſo effectual to ſecure both, as ſuch a Bill. As to the Limitations which were propoſed, if they were ſincerely offered, and had paſs'd into a Law, the Duke then would have been excluded from the power of a King, and the Government quite alter'd, and little more than the name of a King left. So I could not ſee either Sin or Fault in the one, when all People were willing to admit of t'other: but thought it better to have a King with his Prerogative, and the Nation eaſie and ſafe under him, than a King without it, which muſt have bred perpetual Jealouſies, and a continual ſtruggle. All this I ſay only to juſtifie my ſelf, and not to enflame others: Though I cannot but think my Earneſtneſs in that matter has had no ſmall influence in my preſent Sufferings. But I have now done with this World, and am going to a Kingdom which cannot be moved.</p>
               <p>And as to the Conſpiring to ſeize the Guards, which is the Crime for which I am Condemned, and which was made a conſtructive Treaſon for taking away the King's Life, to bring it within the Statue of <hi>Ed.</hi> the 3d. I ſhall give this true and clear account. I never was at Mr. <hi>Shepheard</hi>'s with that Company but once, and there was no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking then of ſecuring or ſeizing the Guards, nor none appointed to view, or examine them: Some Diſcourſe there was of the feaſibleneſs of it, and ſeveral times by accident in general Diſcourſe elſewhere, I have heard it mention'd, as a thing might eaſily be done, but never conſented to as fit to be done. And I remember particularly at my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s there being ſome general Diſcourſe of this kind, I immediately flew out, and exclaim'd againſt it, and ask'd, if the thing ſucceeded, what muſt be done next, but maſſacring the Guards, and killing them in cold blood? Which I look't upon as ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable a thing, and ſo like a Popiſh Practice, that I could not but abhor it. And at the ſame time the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> took me by the hand, and told me very kindly, My Lord, I ſee you and I are of a Temper, did you ever hear ſo horrid a thing? And I muſt needs do him that Juſtice to declare, that I never obſerved in him but an Abhorrence to all baſe things.</p>
               <p>As to my going to Mr. <hi>Shepheard</hi>'s, I went with an intention to taſte <hi>Sherry,</hi> for he had promiſed me to reſerve for me the next very good piece he met with, when I went out of Town; and if he recollects he may remember I ask'd him about it, and he went and fetch'd a Bottle; but when I taſted it, I ſaid 'twas hot in the mouth, and deſired that whenever he met with a choice Piece, he would keep it for me, which he promiſed. I enlarge the more upon this, becauſe Sir <hi>George Jefferies</hi> inſinuated to the Jury, as if I had made a ſtory about going thither; but I never ſaid, that was the only Reaſon: And I will now truly and plainly add the reſt.</p>
               <p>I was the day before this Meeting, come to Town for two or three days, as I had done once or twice before; having a very near and dear Relation lying in a very lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing and deſperate Condition: And the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> came to me, and told me, he was extreamly glad I was come to Town; for my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and ſome hot Men would undo us all: How ſo, my Lord, I ſaid? Why (anſwered he) they'll certainly do
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:48501:138"/>ſome diſorderly thing or other, if great Care be not taken, and therefore for God's ſake uſe your Endeavours with your Friends to prevent any thing of this kind. He told me, there would be Company at Mr. <hi>Shepheard</hi>'s that Night, and deſired me to be at home in the Evening, and he would call me; which he did: And when I came into the Room, I ſaw Mr. <hi>Rumſey</hi> by the Chimney; though he ſwears he came in after; and there were things ſaid by ſome with much more Heat than Judgment, which I did ſufficiently diſapprove, and yet for theſe things I ſtand condemned. But I thank God, my part was ſincere, and well meant. It is, I know, inferr'd from hence, and was preſſed to me, that I was acquainted with theſe Heats and ill Deſigns, and did not diſcover them. But this is but Miſpriſion of Treaſon at moſt. So I dye innocent of the Crime I ſtand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd for, and I hope no body will imagaine that ſo mean a Thought could enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, as to go about to ſave my ſelf, by accuſing others. The part that ſome have acted lately of that kind, has not been ſuch as to invite me to love Life at ſuch a rate.</p>
               <p>As for the Sentence of Death paſſed upon me, I cannot but think it a very hard one. For nothing was ſworn againſt me (whether true or falſe, I will not now examine) but ſome Diſcourſes about making ſome Stirs. And this is not levying War againſt the King, which is Treaſon by the Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, and not the conſulting and diſcourſing about it, which was all that was witneſſed againſt me. But, by a ſtrange Fetch, the Deſign of ſeizing the Guards was conſtrued a Deſign of killing the King; and ſo I was in that caſt.</p>
               <p>And now I have truly and ſincerely told what my part was in that, which cannot be more than a bare Miſpriſion; and yet I am condemned as guilty of a Deſign of killing the King. I pray God lay not this to the charge, neither of the King's Council, nor Judges, nor Sheriffs, nor Jury: And for the Witneſſes, I pity them, and wiſh them well. I ſhall not reckon up the particulars wherein they did me wrong; I had rather their own Conſciences ſhould do that, to which, and the Mercies of God, I leave them. Only I ſtill aver, that what I ſaid of my not hearing Col. <hi>Rumſey</hi> deliver any Meſſage from my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> was true; for I always deteſted Lying, tho' never ſo much to my advantage. And I hope none will be ſo unjuſt and uncharitable, as to think I would venture on it in theſe my laſt Words, for which I am ſo ſoon to give an account to the Great God, the Searcher of Hearts, and Judge of all Things.</p>
               <p>From the time of chuſing Sheriffs, I concluded the Heat in that Matter would produce ſomething of this kind; and I am not much ſurprized to find it fall upon me. And I wiſh what is done to me, may put a ſtop, and ſatiate ſome Peoples Revenge, and that no more innocent Blood be ſhed; for I muſt and do ſtill look upon mine as ſuch, ſince I know I was guilty of no Treaſon; and therefore I would not betray my Innocence by Flight, of which I do not (I thank God) yet repent (tho' much preſſed to it) how fatal ſoever it may have ſeem'd to have proved to me; for I look upon my Death in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner (I thank God) with other eyes than the World does. I know I ſaid but little at the Trial, and I ſuppoſe it looks more like Innocence than Guilt. I was alſo advis'd not to confeſs Matter of Fact plainly, ſince that muſt certainly have brought me within the Guilt of Miſpriſion. And being thus reſtrained from dealing frankly and openly, I choſe rather to ſay little, than to depart from that Ingenuity, that, by the Grace of God, I had carried along with me in the former parts of my Life, and ſo could eaſier be ſilent, and leave the whole Matter to the Conſcience of the Jury, than to make the laſt and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemneſt part of my Life ſo different from the Courſe of it, as the uſing little Tricks and Evaſions muſt have been. Nor did I ever pretend to a great readineſs in ſpeaking: I wiſh thoſe Gentlemen of the Law, who have it, would make more Conſcience in the uſe of it, and not run Men down, and by Strains and Fetches impoſe on eaſie and willing Juries, to the Ruine of innocent Men: For to kill by Forms and Subtilties of Law, is the worſt ſort of Murther. But I wiſh the Rage of hot Men, and the Partialities of Juries, may be ſtopp'd with my Blood, which I would offer up with ſo much the more Joy, if I thought I ſhould be the laſt were to ſuffer in ſuch a way.</p>
               <p>Since my Sentence, I have had but few Thoughts, but Preparatory ones for Death: Yet the importunity of my Friends, and particularly of the Beſt and Deareſt Wife in the World, prevail'd with me to ſign Petitions, and make an Addreſs for my Life: To which I was very averſe. For (I thank God) tho' in all reſpects I have lived one of the happieſt and contented'ſt Men of the World (for now very neer fourteen years) yet I am ſo willing to leave all, that it was not without Difficulty, that I did any thing for the ſaving of my Life, that was Begging. But I was willing to let my Friends ſee what Power they had over me, and that I was not Obſtinate, nor Sullen, but would do any thing that an honeſt Man could do, for their Satisfaction. Which was the only Motive that ſway'd, or had any weight with me.</p>
               <p>And now to ſum up all: As I never had any Deſign againſt the King's Life, or the Life of any Man whatſoever; ſo I never was in any Contrivance of altering the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:48501:139"/>What the Heats, Wickedneſs, Paſſions, and Vanities of other men have occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I ought not to be anſwerable for; nor could I repreſs them, though I now ſuffer for them. But the Will of the Lord be done; into whoſe Hands I commend my Spirit; and truſt that Thou, O moſt Merciful Father, haſt forgiven me all my Tranſgreſſions; the Sins of my Youth, and all the Errors of my paſt Life; and that Thou wilt not lay my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Sins and Ignorances to my Charge; but wilt graciouſly ſupport me during that ſmall part of my Time now before me, and aſſiſt me in my laſt Moments, and not leave me then to be diſorder'd by Fear, or any other Temptations; but make the Light of thy Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to ſhine upon me, for thou art my Sun and my Shield: And as Thou ſupporteſt me by thy Grace, ſo I hope thou wilt hereafter Crown me with Glory, and receive me into the Fellowſhip of Angels and Saints, in that bleſſed Inheritance purchaſed for me by my moſt merciful Redeemer; who is, I truſt, at thy Right Hand, preparing a place for me, and is ready to receive me: into whoſe Hand I commend my Spirit.</p>

            <head>To the KING's Moſt Excellent Majeſty. <hi>The Humble Petition of</hi> Algernon Sidney, <hi>Eſquire.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>THat your Petitioner, after a long and cloſe Impriſonment, was on the 7th day of this Month, with a Guard of Souldiers, brought into the <hi>Palace-yard,</hi> upon an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> directed to the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> before any Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had been exhibited againſt him: But while he was there detain'd, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> was exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, and found; whereupon he was immediately carried to the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> and there Arraign'd. In this ſurprize he deſir'd a Copy of the Indictment, and leave to make his Exceptions, or to put in a Special Plea, and Council to frame it; but all was deny'd him. He then offer'd a Special Plea ready Ingroſs'd, which alſo was rejected without reading: And being threatned, that if he did not immediately plead <hi>Guilty</hi> or <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> Judgment of High Treaſon ſhould be entred, he was forc'd contrary to Law (as he ſuppoſes) to come to a general Iſſue in Pleading <hi>Not Guilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Novemb.</hi> 21. He was brought to his Tryal, and the Indictment being perplexed and confuſed, ſo as neither he nor any of his Friends that heard it, could fully comprehend the ſcope of it, he was wholly unprovided of all the helps that the Law allows to every man for his Defence. Whereupon he did again deſire a Copy, and produc'd an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Copy of the Statute of 46 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. whereby 'tis Enacted, That every man ſhall have a Copy of any Record that touches him in any manner, as well that which is for or againſt the King, as any other perſon; but could neither obtain a Copy of his Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor that the Statute ſhould be read.</p>
            <p>The Jury by which he was try'd, was not (as he is inform'd) ſummon'd by the Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs of the ſeveral Hundreds, in the uſual and legal manner, but names were agreed upon by Mr. <hi>Graham,</hi> and the Under-Sheriff, and directions given to the Bailiffs to Summon them: And being all ſo choſen, a Copy of the Pannel was of no uſe to him. When they came to be call'd, he excepted againſt ſome for being your Majeſties Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, which he hop'd ſhould not have been return'd, when he was proſecuted at your Majeſties Suit; many others for not being Freeholders, which Exceptions he thinks were good in Law; and others were lew'd and infamous perſons, not fit to be of any Jury: But all was over-rul'd by the Lord Chief Juſtice, and your Petitioner forc'd to challenge them Peremptorily, whom he found to be pick'd out as moſt ſuitable to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of thoſe who ſought his Ruin; whereby he loſt the Benefit allow'd him by Law of making his Exceptions, and was forc'd to admit of Mechanick Perſons utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to judge of ſuch a matter as was to be brought before them. This Jury being ſworn, no Witneſs was produc'd, who fixed any thing beyond Hearſay upon your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner, except the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> and them that ſwore to ſome Papers ſaid to be found in his Houſe, and offer'd as a ſecond Witneſs, and written in an Hand like to that of your Petitioner.</p>
            <p>Your Petitioner produced ten Witneſſes, moſt of them of Eminent Quality, the others of unblemiſh'd Fame, to ſhew the Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s Teſtimony was inconſiſtent with what he had declared before (at the Tryal of the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>) under the ſame Religious obligation of an Oath, as if it had been legally adminiſtred.</p>
            <p>Your Petitioner did further endeavour to ſhew, That beſides the Abſurdity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity of his Teſtimony, he being guilty of many Crimes which he did not pretend your Petitioner had any knowledge of, and having no other hope of Pardon, than by the <hi>drudgery</hi> of <hi>Swearing</hi> againſt him, he deſerv'd not to be believ'd. And ſimilitude of Hands could be no Evidence, as was declared by the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Keiling,</hi> and the whole Court in the Lady <hi>Carr</hi>'s Caſe; ſo as that no Evidence at all remain'd againſt him.</p>
            <pb n="267" facs="tcp:48501:139"/>
            <p>That whoſoever wrote thoſe Papers, they were but a ſmall part of a Polemical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in anſwer to a Book written about thirty years ago, upon general Propoſitions, apply'd to no Time, nor any particular Caſe; That it was impoſſible to judge of any part of it, unleſs the whole did appear, which did not; That the ſence of ſuch parts of it as were produced, could not be comprehended, unleſs the whole had been read, which was denied; That the Ink and Paper ſhew'd them to be writ many Years ago; That the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> not knowing of them, they could have no concurrence with what your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner is ſaid to have deſign'd with him and others; That the Confuſion and Errors in the writing ſhew'd they had never been ſo much as review'd, and being written in an Hand that no man could well read, they were not fit for the Preſs, nor could be in ſome Years, though the Writer of them had intended it, which did not appear. But they being only the preſent crude and private thoughts of a man, for the exerciſe of his own underſtanding in his Studies, and never ſhewed to any, or applied to any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Caſe, could not fall under the Statute of 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. which takes cognizance of no ſuch matter, and could not by Conſtruction be brought under it; ſuch matters being thereby reſerved to the Parliament, as is declared in the Proviſo, which he deſired might be read, but was refuſed.</p>
            <p>Several important points of Law did hereupon emerge, upon which your Petitioner, knowing his own weakneſs, did deſire that Council might be heard, or they might be referr'd to be found Specially. But all was over rul'd by the violence of the Lord Ch. Juſtice, and your Petitioner ſo frequently interrupted, that the whole method of his Defence was broken, and he not ſuffered to ſay the tenth part of what he could have alledged in his defence. So the Jury was hurried into a Verdict they did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
            <p>Now foraſmuch as no man that is oppreſſed in <hi>England,</hi> can have Relief, unleſs it be from your Majeſty, your Petitioner humbly prays, that the Premiſes conſidered, your Majeſty would be pleas'd to admit him into your preſence; and if he doth not ſhew, that 'tis for your Majeſties Intereſt and Honour to preſerve him from the ſaid Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, he will not complain though he be left to be deſtroy'd.</p>

               <hi>The very Copy of a Paper delivered to the Sheriffs, upon the Scaffold on</hi> Tower-Hill, <hi>on</hi> Friday December 7. 1683. <hi>By</hi> Algernon Sidney, <hi>

               <salute>Men, Brethren, and Fathers; Friends, Countrymen, and Strangers;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT may be expected that I ſhould now ſay ſome Great Matters unto you, but the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the Seaſon, and the Infirmities of my Age, encreaſed by a cloſe Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of above Five Months, doth not permit me.</p>
            <p>Moreover, we live in an Age that maketh Truth paſs for Treaſon: I dare not ſay any thing contrary unto it, and the Ears of thoſe that are about me will probably be found too tender to hear it. My Tryal and Condemnation doth ſufficiently evidence this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Weſt, Rumſey,</hi> and <hi>Keyling,</hi> who were brought to prove the Plot, ſaid no more of me, than that they knew me not; and ſome others equally known unto me, had uſed my Name, and that of ſome others, to give a little Reputation unto their Deſigns. The Lord <hi>Howard</hi> is too infamous by his Life, and the many Perjuries not to be denied, or rather ſworn by himſelf, to deſerve mention; and being a ſingle Witneſs would be of no value, though he had been of unblemiſh'd Credit, or had not ſeen and confeſſed that the Crimes committed by him would be pardoned only for committing more; and even the Pardon promiſed could not be obtained till the Drudgery of Swearing was over.</p>
            <p>This being laid aſide, the whole matter is reduc'd to the Papers ſaid to be found in my Cloſet by the King's Officers, without any other proof of their being written by me, than what is taken from the ſuppoſitions upon the ſimilitude of an Hand that is eaſily Counterfeited, and which hath been lately declared in the Lady <hi>Car</hi>'s Caſe to be no lawful Evidence in Criminal Cauſes.</p>
            <p>But if I had been ſeen to write them, the matter would not be much altered. They plainly appear to relate unto a large Treatiſe written long ſince in anſwer to <hi>Filmer</hi>'s Book, which by all Intelligent Men is thought to be grounded upon wicked Principles, equally pernicious unto Magiſtrates and People.</p>
            <p>If he might publiſh unto the World his Opinion, That all Men are born under a neceſſity derived from the Laws of God and Nature, to ſubmit unto an Abſolute Kingly Government, which could be reſtrained by no Law, or Oath; and that he that hath the power, whether he came unto it by Creation, Election, Inheritance, Uſurpation, or any other, way had the Right; and none muſt oppoſe his Will, but the Perſons and Eſtates
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:48501:140"/>of his Subjects muſt be indiſpenſably ſubject unto it. I know not why I might not have publiſhed my Opinion to the contrary, without the breach of any Law I have yet known.</p>
            <p>I might as freely as he, publickly have declared my Thoughts, and the Reaſons upon which they were grounded, and I perſwaded to believe, That God had left Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto the Liberty of ſetting up ſuch Governments as beſt pleaſed themſelves.</p>
            <p>That Magiſtrates were ſet up for the good of Nations, not Nations for the honour or glory of Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>That the Right and Power of Magiſtrates in every Country, was that which the Laws of that Country made it to be.</p>
            <p>That thoſe Laws were to be obſerved, and the Oaths taken by them, having the force of a Contract between Magiſtrate and People, could not be Violated without danger of diſſolving the whole Fabrick.</p>
            <p>That Uſurpation could give no Right, and the moſt dangerous of all Enemies unto Kings were they, who raiſing their Power to an Exorbitant Height, allowed unto U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpers all the Rights belonging unto it.</p>
            <p>That ſuch Uſurpations being ſeldom Compaſſed without the Slaughter of the Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perſon, or Family, the worſt of all Villanies was thereby rewarded with the moſt Glorious Privileges.</p>
            <p>That if ſuch Doctrines were received, they would ſtir up Men to the Deſtruction of Princes with more Violence than all the Paſſions that have hitherto raged in the Hearts of the moſt Unruly.</p>
            <p>That none could be ſafe, if ſuch a Reward were propoſed unto any that could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them.</p>
            <p>That few would be ſo gentle as to ſpare even the Beſt, if, by their deſtruction, of a Wild Uſurper, could become God's Anointed; and by the moſt execrable Wickedneſs inveſt himſelf with that Divine Character.</p>
            <p>This is the Scope of the whole Treatiſe; the Writer gives ſuch Reaſons as at preſent did occur unto him to prove it. This ſeems to agree with the Doctrines of the moſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced Authors of all Times, Nations and Religions. The beſt and wiſeſt Kings have ever acknowledged it. The preſent King of <hi>France</hi> hath declared that Kings have that happy want of Power, that they can do nothing contrary unto the Laws of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and grounds his Quarrel with the King of <hi>Spain, Anno</hi> 1667, upon that Principle. King <hi>James</hi> in his Speech to the Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1603, doth in the higheſt degree aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert it: The Scripture ſeems to declare it. If nevertheleſs the Writer was miſtaken, he might have been refuted by Law, Reaſon, and Scripture; and no man for ſuch matters was ever otherwiſe puniſhed, than by being made to ſee his Errour, and it hath not (as I think) been ever known that they had been referred to the Judgment of a Jury, compoſed of Men utterly unable to comprehend them.</p>
            <p>But there was little of this in my Caſe; the extravagance of my Proſecutors goes higher: The above-mentioned Treatiſe was never finiſhed, nor could be in many years, and moſt probably would never have been. So much as is of it was written long ſince, never reviewed nor ſhewn unto any man; and the fiftieth part of it was produced, and not the tenth of that afford to be read. That which was never known unto thoſe who are ſaid to have Conſpired with me, was ſaid to be intended to ſtir up the People in Proſecution of the Deſigns of thoſe Conſpirators.</p>
            <p>When nothing of particular Application unto Time, Place, or Perſon could be found in it, (as hath ever been done by thoſe who endeavour'd to raiſe Inſurrections) all was ſupplied by <hi>Innuendo's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatſoever is ſaid of the Expulſion of <hi>Tarquin,</hi> the Inſurrection againſt <hi>Nero;</hi> the Slaughter of <hi>Caligula,</hi> or <hi>Domitian;</hi> The Tranſlation of the Crown of <hi>France</hi> from <hi>Merovius</hi> his Race unto <hi>Pepin;</hi> and from his Deſcendants unto <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> and the like, applied by <hi>Innuendo</hi> unto the King.</p>
            <p>They have not conſidered, that if ſuch Acts of State be not good, there is not a King in the World that has any Title to the Crown he bears; nor can have any, unleſs he could deduce his Pedigree from the Eldeſt Son of <hi>Noah,</hi> and ſhew that the Succeſſion had ſtill continued in the Eldeſt of the Eldeſt Line, and been ſo deduced to him.</p>
            <p>Every one may ſee what advantage this would be to all the Kings of the World; and whether that failing, it were not better for them to acknowledg they had received their Crowns by the Conſent of Willing Nations; or to have no better Title unto them than Uſurpation and Violence, which by the ſame ways may be taken from them.</p>
            <p>But I was long ſince told that I muſt Die, or the Plot muſt Die.</p>
            <p>Leſt the means of deſtroying the beſt Proteſtants in <hi>England</hi> ſhould fail, the Bench muſt be filled with ſuch as had been Blemiſhes to the Bar.</p>
            <pb n="269" facs="tcp:48501:140"/>
            <p>None but ſuch as theſe would have Adviſed with the King's Council, of the means of bringing a Man to Death; Suffered a Jury to be packed by the King's Sollicitors, and the Under-Sheriff; Admit of Jury-men who are not Freeholders; Receive ſuch Evidence as is above-mentioned; Refuſe a Copy of an Indictment, or to Suffer the Statute of 46 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. to be read, that doth expreſly Enact, it ſhould in no Caſe be denied unto any Man upon any occaſion whatſoever; over rule the moſt important Points of Law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hearing. And whereas the Stat. 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. upon which they ſaid I ſhould be Tried, doth Reſerve unto the Parliament all Conſtructions to be made in Points of Treaſon. They could aſſume unto themſelves not only a Power to make Conſtructions, but ſuch Conſtructions as neither agree with Law, Reaſon, or Common Senſe.</p>
            <p>By theſe means I am brought to this place. The Lord forgive theſe Practices, and avert the Evils that threaten the Nation from them. The Lord ſanctify theſe my Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings unto me; and tho' I fall as a Sacrifice unto Idols, ſuffer not Idolatry to be Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in this Land. Bleſs thy People, and ſave them. Defend thy own Cauſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thoſe that defend it. Stir up ſuch as are Faint; Direct thoſe that are willing; confirm thoſe that Waver; Give Wiſdom and Integrity unto all. Order all things ſo as may moſt redound unto thine own Glory. Grant that I may Die glorifying thee for all thy Mercies; and that at the laſt thou haſt permitted me to be Singled out as a Witneſs of thy Truth; and even by the Confeſſion of my Oppoſers, for that <hi>OLD CA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE</hi> in which I was from my Youth engaged, and for which thou haſt Often and Wonderfully declared thy Self.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. Of MAGISTRACY.</head>
               <p n="1">I. RELATION is nothing elſe but that State of Mutual Reſpect and Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which one Thing or Perſon has to another.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Such are the Relations of Father and Son, Husband and Wife, Maſter and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, Magiſtrate and Subject.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The Relations of a Father, Husband and Maſter, are really diſtinct and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; that is, one of them is not the other; For he may be any one of theſe, who is none of the reſt.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. This diſtinction proceeds from the different Reaſons, upon which theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations are Founded.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The Reaſon or Foundation, from whence ariſes the Relation of a Father, is from having Begotten his Son, who may as properly call every Old Man he meets his Father, as any other Perſon whatſoever, excepting him only who Begat him.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The Relation of an Husband and Wife is founded in Wedlock, whereby they mutually conſent to become one Fleſh.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. The Relation of a Maſter is founded in that Right and Title which he has to the Poſſeſſion, or Service, of his Slave or Servant.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. In theſe Relations, the Name of Father, Husband, and Maſter, imply Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty and Superiority, which varies notwithſtanding, and is more or leſs Abſolute, according to the Foundation of theſe ſeveral Relations.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. The Superiority of a Father is founded in that Power, Priority and Dignity of Nature, which a Cauſe hath over its Effect.</p>
               <p n="10">X. The diſtance is not ſo great in Wedlock, but the Superiorty of the Husband over the Wife, is like that of the Right hand over the left in the ſame Body.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. The Superiority of a Maſter, is an abſolute Dominion over his Slave, a Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and Conditionate Command over his Servant.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. The Titles of <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> and <hi>Sponſus Regni,</hi> Father of the Country, and Husband of the Realm, are Metaphors and improper Speeches: For no Prince ever Begat a whole Country of Subjects; nor can a Kingdom more properly be ſaid to be Married, than the City of <hi>Venice</hi> is to the <hi>Adriatique Gulph.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">XIII. And to ſhew further, that Magiſtracy is not Paternal Authority, nor Monarchy founded in Fatherhood; it is undeniably plain, that a Son may be the Natural Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lord of his own Father, as <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond had been of <hi>Jeffery Plantagenet,</hi> if he had been an <hi>Engliſhman;</hi> which, they ſay, <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh did not love to think of, when his Sons grew up to Years. And this Caſe alone is an Eternal Confutation of the Patriarchate.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. Neither is Magiſtracy a Martial Power, for the Husband may be the Obedient Subject of his own Wife, as <hi>Philip</hi> was of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:48501:141"/>
               <p n="15">XV. Nor is it that Dominion which a Maſter has over his Slave, for then a Prince might Lawfully Sell all his Subjects, like ſo many head of Cattle, and make Money of his whole ſtock whenever he pleaſes, as a Patron of <hi>Algiers</hi> does.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. Neither is the Relation of Prince and Subject the ſame with that of a Maſter and hired Servant, for he does not hire them, but, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>They pay him Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,</hi> in conſideration of his continual <hi>Attendance</hi> and <hi>Imployment</hi> for the Publick Good.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. That publick Office and Imployment is the Foundation of the Relation of King and Subject, as many other Relations are likewiſe Founded upon other Functions and Adminiſtrations, ſuch as <hi>Guardian</hi> and <hi>Ward,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="18">XVIII. The Office of a King is ſet down at large in the XVII. Chap. of the Laws of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, to which the ſucceeding Kings have been ſworn at their Coronation: And it is affirmed in the Preambles of the Statutes of
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Prout Regalis Officii expoſcit utilitas</note>

               <p>THE Diſcourſe we had the other Day, I hope ſatisfied you in the main, that Chriſt can have but one Church here upon Earth, and I believe that it is as viſible as that the Scripture is in Print; That none can be that Church, but that, which is called the <hi>Roman Catholick Church.</hi> I think you need not trouble your ſelf with entring into that Ocean of particular Diſputes, when the main, and, in truth, the only Queſtion is; Where that Church is, which we profeſs to believe in the two Creeds? We declare there to believe <hi>one Catholick and Apoſtolick Church,</hi> and it is not left to every phantaſtical man's head to believe as he pleaſes, but to the Church to whom Chriſt left the power upon Earth to govern us in matters of Faith, who made theſe Creeds for our Directions. It were a very Irrational thing to make Laws for a Country, and leave it to the Inhabitants, to be the Interpreters and Judges of thoſe Laws, For then every man will be his own Judge, and by conſequence no ſuch thing as either right or wrong. Can we therefore ſuppoſe that God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would leave us at thoſe uncertainties, as to give us a Rule to go by, and to leave every man to be his own Judge? I do ask any ingenuous man, whether it be not the ſame thing to follow our own Fancy or to interpret the Scripture by it? I would have any man ſhew me, where the power of deciding matters of Faith is given to every particular man. Chriſt left his power to his Church even <hi>to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give Sins in Heaven,</hi> and left his Spirit with them, which they exerciſed after his Reſurrection: Firſt by his Apoſtles in theſe Creeds, and many years after by the Council at <hi>Nice,</hi> where that Creed was made that is called by that name, and by the power which they had received from Chriſt, they were the Judges even of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf many years after the Apoſtles, which Books were Canonical and which were not. And if they had this power then, I deſire to know how they came to loſe it, and by what Authority men ſeparate themſelves from that Church? The only pretence I ever heard of, was, becauſe the Church has fail'd in wreſting and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting the Scripture contrary to the true ſence and meaning of it, and that they have impoſed Articles of Faith upon us, which are not to be warranted by God's word? I do deſire to know who is to be Judge of that, whether the whole Church, the Succeſſion whereof has continued to this day without interruption, or particular men who have raiſed Schims for their own advantage?</p>

               <head>The Second Paper.</head>
               <p>IT is a ſad thing to conſider what a world of Hereſies are crept into this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Every man thinks himſelf as competent a Judge of the Scriptures as the very Apoſtles themſelves; and 'tis no wonder that it ſhould be ſo, ſince that part of the Nation which looks moſt like a Church, dares not bring the true Arguments againſt the other Sects, for fear they ſhould be turned againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and confuted by their own Arguments. The Church of <hi>England</hi> (as 'tis call'd) would fain have it thought, that they are the Judges in matters Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and yet dare not ſay poſitively that there is no Appeal from them; for
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:48501:143"/>either they muſt ſay, that they are Infallible (which they cannot pretend to) or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that what they decide in matters of Conſcience, is no further to be followed, then it agrees with every mans private Judgment. If Chriſt did leave a Church here upon Earth, and we were all once of that Church, how? and by what Authority, did we ſeparate from that Church? If the power of Interpreting of Scripture be in every mans brain, what need have we of a Church or Church-men; To what purpoſe then did our Saviour, after he had given his Apoſtles power to <hi>Bind and Looſe in Heaven and Earth,</hi> add to it, <hi>that he would be with them even to the end of the World?</hi> Theſe words were not ſpoken Parabolically, or by way of Figure. Chriſt was then aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his Glory, and left his Power with his Church even <hi>to the End of the World.</hi> We have had theſe hundred years paſt, the ſad effects of denying to the Church that Power in matters Spiritual, without an Appeal. What Country can ſubſiſt in peace or quiet, where there is not a Supream Judge from whence there can be no Appeal? Can there be any Juſtice done where the Offenders are their own Judges, and equal Interpreters of the Law, with thoſe that are appointed to adminiſter Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice? This is our Caſe here in <hi>England</hi> in matters Spiritual; for the Proteſtants are not of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as 'tis the true Church from whence there can be no Appeal; but becauſe the Diſcipline of that Church is conformable at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to their fancies, which as ſoon as it ſhall contradict or vary from, they are ready to embrace or joyn with the next Congregation of People, whoſe Diſcipline and Worſhip agrees with their Opinion at that time, ſo that according to this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, there is no other Church, nor Interpreter of Scripture but that which lies in every mans giddy brain. I deſire to know therefore of every ſerious Conſiderer of theſe things, whether the great work of our Salvation ought to depend upon ſuch a Sandy Foundation as this? Did Chriſt ever ſay to the Civil Magiſtrate (much leſs to the People) <hi>that he would be with them to the end of the World?</hi> Or, did he give them the Power <hi>to forgive Sins?</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians, Ye are Gods Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, ye are Gods Building; we are Labourers with God.</hi> This ſhews who are the <hi>Labourers,</hi> and who are the <hi>Husbandry</hi> and <hi>Building:</hi> And in this whole Chapter, and in the preceeding one, St. <hi>Paul</hi> takes great pains to ſet forth that they, the Clergy, <hi>have the Spirit of God, without which no man ſearcheth the deep things of God;</hi> and he concludeth the Chapter with this Verſe, <hi>For who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may inſtruct him? But we have the mind of Chriſt.</hi> Now if we do but conſider in humane probability and reaſon, the powers Chriſt leaves to his Church in the Goſpel, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> explains ſo diſtinctly afterwards, we cannot think that our Saviour ſaid all theſe things to no purpoſe; And pray conſider on the other ſide, that thoſe who reſiſt the truth, and will not ſubmit to his Church, draw their Arguments from Implications, and far fetch'd Interpretations, at the ſame time that they deny plain and poſitive words; which is ſo great a Diſingenuity, that 'tis not almoſt to be thought that they can believe themſelves. Is there any other founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Proteſtant Church, but that if the Civil Magiſtrate pleaſe, he may call ſuch of the Clergy as he thinks fit for his turn at that time; and turn the Church either to <hi>Presbytery, Independency,</hi> or indeed what he pleaſes? This was the way of our pretended Reformation here in <hi>England;</hi> and by the ſame Rule and Authority it may be altered into as many more Shapes and Forms as there are Fancies in mens Heads.</p>

               <hi>A</hi> LETTER, <hi>Containing ſome Remarks on the Two Papers, writ by His late Majeſty King</hi> CHARLES <hi>the Second, Concerning Religion.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Thank you for the two Royal Papers that you have ſent me: I had heard of them before, but now we have them ſo well atteſted, that there is no hazard of being deceived by a falſe Copy: you expect that in return, I ſhould let you know what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion they have made upon me. I pay all the reverence that is due to a Crowned Head, even in Aſhes; to which I will never be wanting: far leſs am I capable of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the Royal Atteſtation that accompanies them; of the truth of which I take
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:48501:143"/>it for granted no man doubts; but I muſt crave leave to tell you, that I am confident, the late King only copied them, and that they are not of his Compoſing. for as they have nothing of that free Air, with which he expreſſed himſelf; ſo there is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture in them, that does not look like a Prince; and the beginning of the firſt ſhews it was the effect of a Converſation, and was to be communicated to another: ſo that I am apt to think they were Compoſed by another, and were ſo well reliſhed by the late King, that he thought fit to keep them, in order to his examining them more particularly; and that he was prevailed with to Copy them leſt a Paper of that nature might have been made a Crime if it had been found about him written by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother hand: and I could name one or two Perſons, who as they were able enough to Compoſe ſuch Papers, ſo had power enough over his Spirit to engage him to Copy them, and to put themſelves out of danger by reſtoring the Original.</p>
            <p>You ought to addreſs your ſelf to the Learned Divines of our Church, for anſwer to ſuch things in them as puzzle you, and not to one that has not the honour to be of that Body, and that has now carried a Sword for ſome time, and imploys the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that at any time he enjoys, rather in Philoſophical and Mathematical Enquiries than in matters of Controverſie. There is indeed one Conſideration that determined me more eaſily to comply with your deſires, which is, my having had the honour to diſcourſe copiouſly of thoſe matters with the late King himſelf: and he having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to me ſome of the particulars that I find in thoſe Papers, and I having ſaid ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things to him, in anſwer to thoſe Heads, which he offered to me only as Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, with which he ſeemed fully ſatisfied, I am the more willing to communicate to you, that which I took the liberty to lay before His late Majeſty on ſeveral occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: the particulars on which he inſiſted in diſcourſe with me, were the <q>uſeleſsneſs of a Law without a Judge, and the neceſſity of an infallible Tribunal to determine Controverſies, to which he added, the many Sects that were in <hi>England,</hi> which ſeemed to be a neceſſary conſequence of the Liberty that every one took to interpret the Scriptures: and he often repeated that of the Church of <hi>Englands</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, from the obligation to obey the Church, againſt the Sectaries, which he thought was of no force, unleſs they allowed more Authority to the Church then they ſeemed willing to admit, in their Diſputes with this Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </q> But upon the whole Matter I will offer you ſome Reflections, that will, <hi>I</hi> hope, be of as great weight with you, as they are with my ſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">I. All Arguments that prove upon ſuch general Conſiderations, that there ought to be an Infallible Judge named by Chriſt, and cloathed with his Authority, ſignify no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, unleſs it can be ſhewed us, in what Texts of Scripture that nomination is to be found; and till that is ſhewed, they are only Arguments brought to prove that <hi>Chriſt ought to have done ſomewhat that he has not done.</hi> So theſe are in effect ſo many Arguments againſt Chriſt, unleſs it appears that he has Authoriſed ſuch a Judge: therefore the right way to end this Diſpute, is, to ſhew where ſuch a Conſtitution is Authoriſed: So that the moſt that can be made of this is, that it amounts to a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable preſumption.</p>
            <p n="2">II. It is a very unreaſonable thing for us to form Preſumptions, of what is, or ought to be, from Inconveniences that do ariſe, in caſe that ſuch things are not: for we may carry this ſo far, that it will not be eaſie to ſtop it. It ſeems more ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the infinite Goodneſs of God, to communicate the knowledge of himſelf to all Mankind, and to furniſh every Man with ſuch aſſiſtances as will certainly prevail over him. It ſeems alſo reaſonable to think, that ſo perfect a Saviour as Jeſus Chriſt was, ſhould have ſhewed us a certain way, and yet conſiſtent with the free Uſe of our Faculties, of avoiding all ſin: nor is it very eaſie to imagine, that it ſhould be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach on his Goſpel, if there is not an Infallible Preſervative againſt Errour, when it is acknowledged; that there is no infallible Preſervative againſt ſin: for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the one Damns us more Infallibly, than the other.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Since preſumptions are ſo much inſiſted on, to prove what things muſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Chriſt; it is to be conſidered, that it is alſo a reaſonable Preſumption, that if ſuch a Court was appointed by him, it muſt be done in ſuch plain terms that there can be no room to queſtion the meaning of them: and ſince this is the hinge upon which all other matters turn, it ought to be expreſſed ſo particularly, in whom it is veſted, that there ſhould be no occaſion given to diſpute, whether it is in one Man or in a Body; and if in a Body, whether in the Majority, or in the two thirds, or in the whole Body unanimouſly agreeing; in ſhort, the Chief thing in all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being the Nature and Power of the Judges, thoſe are always diſtinctly ſpecified; and therefore if theſe things are not ſpecified in the Scriptures, it is at leaſt a ſtrong Preſumption, that Chriſt did not intend to authoriſe ſuch Judges.</p>
            <pb n="276" facs="tcp:48501:144"/>
            <p n="4">IV. There were ſeveral Controverſies raiſed among the Churches to which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles writ, as appears by the Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans, Corinthians, Galatians,</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians,</hi> yet the Apoſtles never make uſe of thoſe paſſages that are pretended for this Authority to put an end to thoſe Controverſies; which is a ſhrew'd Preſumption, that they did not underſtand them in that ſenſe in which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does now take them. Nor does St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the Directions that he gives to the Church-men in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> reckon this of ſubmitting to the directions of the Church for one, which he could not have omitted, if this be the true meaning of thoſe diſputed paſſages: and yet he has not one word ſounding that way, which is very different from the directions which one poſſeſſed with the preſent view that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has of this matter muſt needs have given.</p>
            <p n="5">V. There are ſome things very expreſly taught in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Rules of a good Life, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the Sacraments, the addreſſing our ſelves to God, for Mercy and Grace,</hi> thro' the Sacrifice that Chriſt offered for us on the Croſs, and the worſhipping him as God, the Death, Reſurrection and Aſcention of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Bodies and Life Everlaſting: by which it is apparent, that we are ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond doubt in thoſe matters; if then there are other paſſages more obſcure concerning other matters, we muſt conclude, that theſe are not of that Conſequence, otherwiſe they would have been as <hi>plainly</hi> reveal'd as others are; but above all, if the Authority of the <hi>Church</hi> is delivered to us in <hi>diſputable terms,</hi> that <hi>is</hi> a <hi>juſt</hi> prejudice againſt it, ſince it is a thing of ſuch Conſequence, that it ought to have been revealed in a way ſo very clear and paſt all diſpute.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. If it is a <hi>Preſumption</hi> for particular Perſons to judge concerning <hi>Religion,</hi> which muſt be ſtill referred to <hi>the Prieſts</hi> and other Guides in Sacred Matters, this is a good Argument to oblige all <hi>Nations</hi> to continue in the <hi>Eſtabliſhed Religion,</hi> whatever it may happen to be; and above all others, it was a convincing Argument in the Mouths of the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt our <hi>Saviour.</hi> He pretended to be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and proved it both by the <hi>Propheſies</hi> that were accompliſhed in him, and by the <hi>Miracles</hi> that he wrought: as for the <hi>Propheſies,</hi> the Reaſons urged by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will conclude much ſtronger, that ſuch dark paſſages as thoſe of the Prophets were, ought not to be interpreted by <hi>particular Perſons,</hi> but that the Expoſition of theſe muſt be referred to the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> it <hi>being</hi> expreſly proved in their Law (Deut. 17.8.) <hi>That when Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies aroſe, concerning any Cauſe that was too intricate, they were to go to the place which God ſhould chooſe, and to the Prieſts of the Tribe of</hi> Levi, <hi>and to the Judge in thoſe days, and that they were to declare what was right, and to their deciſion all were obliged to ſubmit, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of Death:</hi> So that by this it appears, that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> in the <hi>Jewiſh Religion</hi> were authoriſed in ſo extraordinary a manner, that I dare ſay, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would not <hi>wiſh</hi> for a more formal Teſtimony on her behalf: As for our <hi>Saviour's</hi> Miracles, theſe were not ſufficient neither, unleſs his <hi>Doctrine</hi> was firſt found to be good: ſince <hi>Moſes</hi> had expreſly warned the people (Deut. 13.1.) <hi>That if a Prophet came and taught them to follow after other Gods, they were not to obey him, tho' he wrought Miracles to prove his Miſſion, but were to put him to Death:</hi> So a <hi>Jew</hi> ſaying, that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by making himſelf one with his Father, brought in the worſhip of another God, might well pretend that he was not <hi>oblig'd</hi> to yield to the Authority of our <hi>Saviour's Miracles,</hi> without taking cogniſance of his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and of the Propheſies concerning the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and in a word, of the whole matter. So that if theſe <hi>Reaſonings</hi> are now good againſt the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> they were as ſtrong in the Mouths of the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt our <hi>Saviour:</hi> and from hence we ſee, that the Authority that ſeems to be given by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> muſt be underſtood with ſome Reſtrictions; ſince we not only find the Prophets, and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> in particular, oppoſing themſelves to the whole body of them, but we ſee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that for ſome conſiderable time before our <hi>Saviour's</hi> days, not only many ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded Traditions had got in among them, by which the vigor of the Moral Law was much enervated, but likewiſe they were univerſally poſſeſſed with a falſe notion of their <hi>Meſſias;</hi> ſo that even the Apoſtles themſelves had not quite ſhaken off thoſe prejudices at the time of our Saviour's Aſcention. So that here a Church, that was ſtill the Church of God, that had the appointed means of the Expiations of their ſins, by their Sacrifices and <hi>Waſhings,</hi> as well as by their Circumciſion, was yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great and fatal Errors, from which particular perſons had no <hi>way</hi> to extricate themſelves, but by examining the Doctrine and Texts of Scripture, and by judging of them according to the Evidence of Truth, and the force and freedom of their Faculties.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. It ſeems Evident, that the paſſage <hi>(Tell the Church)</hi> belongs only to the <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling of Differences:</hi> that of <hi>binding and looſing,</hi> according to the uſe of thoſe terms
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:48501:144"/>among the <hi>Jews</hi> ſignifies only an <hi>Authority</hi> that was given to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of giving Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, by which men were to be obliged to ſuch Duties, or ſet at liberty from them: and <hi>(the gates of Hell not prevailing againſt the Church)</hi> ſignifies only, that the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion was never to come to an end, or to periſh; and that of (<hi>Chriſt's being with the</hi> Apoſtles <hi>to the end of the</hi> world) imports only a ſpecial conduct and protection which the <hi>Church may always</hi> expect, but as the promiſe, I will not leave thee nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thee; that belongs to every <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> does not import an <hi>Infallibility:</hi> no more does the other. And for thoſe paſſages concerning (<hi>the Spirit</hi> of God <hi>that ſearches all things</hi>) it is plain, that in them St. <hi>Paul</hi> is treating of the Divine <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> by which the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion was then opened to the World, which he ſets in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Wiſdom or Philoſophy of the Greeks; ſo that as all thoſe paſſages come ſhort of proving that for which they are alledged, it muſt at laſt be acknowledged, that they have not an Evidence great enough to prove ſo important a truth, as ſome would evince by them; ſince 'tis a matter of ſuch vaſt conſequence, that the proofs for it muſt have an undeniable Evidence.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. In the matters of <hi>Religion</hi> two things are to be conſidered; firſt, the <hi>Account</hi> that we muſt give to God, and the <hi>Rewards</hi> that we expect from him: and in this every man muſt anſwer for the ſincerity of his Heart, in <hi>examining</hi> Divine Matters, and the following what (upon the beſt Enquiries that one could make) appeared to be true: and with relation to this, there is no need of a Judge: for in that Great Day every one muſt <hi>anſwer</hi> to God according to the Talents that he had, and all will be ſaved according to their ſincerity; and with relation to <hi>that</hi> Judgment, there is no need of any other Judge but God. A ſecond view of <hi>Religion, is</hi> as it <hi>is</hi> a Body uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together, and by conſequence brought under ſome Regulation: and as in all States, there are ſubaltern Judges, in whoſe deciſions all muſt at leaſt acquieſce, tho' they are not <hi>infallible,</hi> there being ſtill a ſort of an Appeal to be made to the Sovereign or the Supream Legiſlative Body; ſo the Church has a ſubaltern Juriſdiction, but as the Authority o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Inferiour Judges is ſtill regulated, and none but the Legiſlators them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have an Authority equal to the Law; ſo it <hi>is</hi> not neceſſary for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Peace and Order, that the Deciſions of the <hi>Church</hi> ſhould be <hi>infallible,</hi> or of equal <hi>Authority</hi> with the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> If Judges do ſo manifeſtly abuſe their Authority, that they fall into Rebellion and Treaſon, the Subjects are no more bound to conſider them; but are obliged to reſiſt them, and to maintain their Obedience to their Sovereign; tho' in other matters their Judgment muſt take place, till they are reverſed by the Sovereign. The caſe of <hi>Religion</hi> being then this, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is the Sovereign of the Church;</hi> the Aſſembly of the <hi>Paſtors</hi> is only a ſubaltern Judge: if they manifeſtly oppoſe themſelves to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which is the <hi>Law of Chriſtians,</hi> particular perſons may be ſuppoſed as competent <hi>Judges</hi> of that, as in civil Matters they may be of the Rebellion of the Judges, and in that caſe they are bound ſtill to maintain their Obedience to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> In matters indifferent, <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are bound, for the preſervation of Peace and Unity, to acquieſce in the Deciſions of the <hi>Church,</hi> and in Matters juſtly doubtful, or of ſmall Conſequence, tho' they are convinced that the <hi>Paſtors</hi> have erred, yet they are obliged to be ſilent, and to bear tolerable things rather than make a Breach; but if it <hi>is</hi> viſible, that the <hi>Paſtors</hi> do Rebel againſt the <hi>Sovereign of the Church,</hi> I mean <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the people may put in their Appeal to that great Judge, and there it muſt lie. If the Church did uſe this Authority with due Diſcretion, and the people followed the Rules that I have named with Humility and Modeſty, there would be no great danger of many Diviſions; but this is the great Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of the providence of God, that men are ſtill men, and both Paſtors and People mix their Paſſions and Intereſts ſo with matters of Religion, that as there is a great deal of Sin and Vice ſtill in the World, ſo that appears in the Matters of Religion as well as in other things: but the ill Conſequences of this; tho' they are bad enough, yet are not equal Effects that ignorant Superſtition, and Obedient Zeal have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the World, Witneſs the Rebellions and <hi>Wars</hi> for eſtabliſhing the Worſhip of Images; the <hi>Croiſſades</hi> againſt the <hi>Saracens,</hi> in which many Millions were loſt; thoſe againſt Hereticks, and Princes depoſed <hi>by</hi> Popes, <hi>which</hi> laſted for ſome Ages; and the Maſſacre of <hi>Paris,</hi> with the Butcheries of the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> in the laſt Age, and that of <hi>Ireland</hi> in this: which are, I ſuppoſe far greater Miſchiefs than any that can be imagined to ariſe out of a ſmall Diverſion of <hi>Opinions:</hi> and the preſent State of this Church, notwithſtanding all thoſe unhappy Rents that are in it, is a much more deſirable thing, than the groſs Ignorance and blind Superſtition that reigns in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> at this day.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. All theſe reaſonings concerning the Infallibility of the Church ſignifie nothing, unleſs we can certainly know, whither we muſt go for this Deciſion: for while one
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:48501:145"/>Party ſhews us, that it muſt be in the <hi>Pope,</hi> or is no where, and another Party ſays it cannot be in the <hi>Pope,</hi> becauſe as many <hi>Popes</hi> have erred, ſo this is a Doctrine that was not known in the Church for a thouſand Years, and that has been diſputed ever ſince it was firſt aſſerted, we are in the right to believe both ſides; firſt, that if it is not in the <hi>Pope,</hi> it is no where; and than, that certainly it is not in the <hi>Pope;</hi> and it is very Incongruous to ſay, that there is an Infallible Authority in the Church, and that yet it is not certain where one muſt ſeek for it; for the one ought to be as clear as the other, and it is alſo plain, that what Primacy ſoever St. <hi>Peter</hi> may be ſuppoſed to have had, the Scripture ſays not one word of his Succeſſors at <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo at leaſt this is not ſo clear, as a matter of this Conſequence muſt have been, if Chriſt had intended to have lodged ſuch an Authority in that See.</p>
            <p n="10">X. It is no leſs Incongruous to ſay, that this Infallibility is in a General Council: for it muſt be ſomewhere elſe, otherwiſe it will return only to the Church by ſome ſtarts, and other long intervals: and as it was not in the Church, for the firſt Three Hundred and Twenty years, ſo it has not been in the Church theſe laſt 120 years. It is plain alſo, that there is no Regulation given in the Scriptures: concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this great Aſſembly, who have a right to come and Vote, and what forfeits this right, and what numbers muſt concur in a Deciſion, to aſſure us of the Infallibility of the Judgment. It is certain, there was never a General Council of all the Paſtors of the Church: for thoſe of which we have the Acts, were only the Council of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, but for thoſe Churches, that were in the South of <hi>Africk,</hi> or the Eaſtern parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> beyond the bounds of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, as they could not be ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Emperours Authority, ſo it is certain none of them were preſent: unleſs one or two of <hi>Perſia</hi> at <hi>Nice,</hi> which perhaps was a Corner of <hi>Perſia</hi> belonging to the Empire; and unleſs it can be proved, that the Pope has an Abſolute Authority to cut off whole Churches from their right of coming to Councils, there has been no Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council theſe laſt 700 years in the World, ever ſince the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> have Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated all the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches upon ſuch trifling Reaſons, that their own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are now aſhamed of them; and I will ask no more of a Man of a Competent Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, to ſatisfie him, that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was no General Council, acting in that Freedom that became Biſhops, than that he will be at the pains to read <hi>Card. Pallavicin</hi>'s Hiſtory of that Council.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. If it is ſaid, that this Infallibility is to be fought for in the Tradition of the Doctrine in all Ages, and that every particular Perſon muſt examine this: here is a Sea before him, and inſtead of examining the ſmall Book of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in a ſtudy that muſt coſt a Man an Age to go thro' it; and many of the Ages, thro' which he carries this Enquiry, are ſo dark, and have produced ſo few Writers, at leaſt ſo few are preſerved to our days, that it is not poſſible to find out their Belief. We find alſo Traditions have varied ſo much, that it is hard to ſay that there is much weight to be laid on this way of Conveyance. A Tradition concerning Matters of Fact that all People ſee, is leſs apt to fail than a Tradition of Points of Speculation: and yet we ſee very near the Age of the Apoſtles, contrary Traditions touching the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> from which we muſt conclude, that either the Matter of Fact of one ſide, or the other, as it was handed down, was not true, or at leaſt that it was not rightly underſtood. A Tradition concerning the Uſe of the Sacraments, being a viſible thing, is the more likely to be exact, than a Speculation concerning their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and yet we find a Tradition of giving Infants the Communion, grounded on the indiſpenſible neceſſity of the Sacrament, continued 1000 years in the Church. A Tradition on which the Chriſtians founded their Joy and Hope, is leſs like to be changed, than a more remote Speculation, and yet the firſt Writers of the Chriſtian Religion had a Tradition handed down to them by thoſe who ſaw the Apoſtles, of the Reign of Chriſt for a Thouſand Years upon Earth; and if thoſe who had Matters at ſecond hand from the Apoſtles, could be thus miſtaken, it is more reaſonable to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend greater Errors at ſuch a diſtance. A Tradition concerning the Book of the Scriptures is more like to be exact, than the Expoſitions of ſome paſſages in it; and yet we find the Church did unanimouſly believe the Tranſlation of the 70 Interpreters to have been the effect of a miraculous Inſpiration, till St. <hi>Jerome</hi> examined this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter better, and made a New Tranſlation from the Hebrew Copies. But which is more than all the reſt, it ſeems plain, that the Fathers before the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> believed the Divinity of the Son of God to be in ſome ſort inferiour to that of the Father, and for ſome Ages after the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> they believed them indeed both equal, but they conſidered theſe as two different Beings, and only one in Eſſence, as, three men have the ſame Humane Nature in common among them; and that as one Candle lights another, ſo the one flowed from another; and after the Fifth Century the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:48501:145"/>of one Individual Eſſence was received. If you will be farther informed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, <hi>Father Petau</hi> will ſatisfie you as to the firſt Period before the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and the leared Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> as to the ſecond. In all which particulars it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, how variable a thing Tradition is. And upon the whole matter, the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Tradition thus, is ſtill a ſearching among Books, and here is no living Judge.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. If then the Authority that muſt decide Controverſies, lies in the Body of the Paſtors ſcattered over the World, which is the laſt retrenchment, here as many and as great Scruples will ariſe, as we found in any of the former Heads. Two diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties appear at firſt view, the one is, How can we be aſſured that the preſent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the Church are derived in a juſt Succeſſion from the Apoſtles: there are no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters extant that prove this: So that we have nothing for it but ſome Hiſtories, that are ſo careleſly writ, that we find many miſtakes in them in other Matters; and they are ſo different in the very firſt links of that Chain, that immediately ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Apoſtles, that the utmoſt can be made of this, is, that here is an Hiſtorical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſomewhat doubtful; but here is nothing to found our Faith on: ſo that if a Succeſſion from the Apoſtles times, is neceſſary to the Conſtitution of that Church, to which we muſt ſubmit our ſelves, we know not where to find it: beſides that, the Doctrine of the neceſſity of the Intention of the Miniſter to the Validity of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, throws us into inextricable difficulties. I know they generally ſay, that by the Intention they do not mean the inward Acts of the Miniſter of the Sacrament, but only that it muſt appear by his outward deportment, that he is in earneſt going about a Sacrament, and not doing a thing in jeſt; and this appeared ſo reaſonable to me, that I was ſorry to find our Divines urge it too much: till turning over the Rubricks that are at the beginning of the Miſſal, I found upon the head of the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Miniſter, that if a <hi>Prieſt</hi> has a number of <hi>Hoſties</hi> before him to be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, and intends to Conſecrate them all, except one, in that caſe that Vagrant Exception falls upon them all: it not being affixed to any one, and it is defined that he Conſecrates none at all. Here it is plain, that the ſecret <hi>Acts</hi> of a Prieſt can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat the Sacrament: ſo this overthrows all certainty concerning a Succeſſion: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, we are ſure, that the <hi>Greek Churches</hi> have a much more unconteſted Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion than the <hi>Latines:</hi> So that a Succeſſion cannot direct us. And if it is neceſſary to ſeek out the Doctrines that are univerſally received, this is not poſſible for a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man to know. So that in ignorant Countries, where there is little Study, the people have no other certainty concerning their Religion, but what they take from their Curate and Confeſſor: ſince they cannot examine what is generally received. So that it muſt be confeſſed, that all the Arguments that are brought for the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a conſtant <hi>infallible Judge,</hi> turn againſt all thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that do not acknowledge the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Pope:</hi> for if he is not <hi>infallible,</hi> they have no other <hi>Judge,</hi> that can pretend to it. It were alſo eaſie to ſhew, that ſome Doctrines have been as Univerſally received in ſome Ages, as they have been rejected in others; which ſhews, that the Doctrine of the preſent Church is not always a ſure meaſure. For five Ages together, the Doctrine of the Pope's Power to <hi>depoſe Heretical Princes</hi> was received without the leaſt Oppoſition: and this cannot be doubted by any that knows what has been the State of the Church, ſince the end of the Eleventh Century: and yet I believe few Princes would allow this, notwithſtanding all the concurring Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of ſo many Ages to fortiſie it. I could carry this into a great many other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, but I ſingle out this, becauſe it is a point in which Princes are naturally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream ſenſible.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter, it can never enter into my mind, that God, who has made Man a Creature, that naturally enquires and reaſons, and that feels as ſenſible a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure when he can give himſelf a good account of his Actions, as one that ſees, does per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in compariſon to a blind man that is led about; and that this God that has alſo made Religion on deſign to perfect this Humane Nature, and to raiſe it to the utmoſt height to which it can arrive, has contrived it to be dark, and to be ſo much beyond the penetration of our Faculties, that we cannot find out his mind in thoſe things that are neceſſary for our Salvation: and that the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that were writ by plain men, in a very familiar Stile, and addreſt without any Diſcrimination to the Vulgar, ſhould become ſuch an unintelligible Book in theſe Ages, that we muſt have an <hi>infallible Judge</hi> to expound it: and when I ſee not only <hi>Popes,</hi> but even ſome Bodies that paſs for Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils, have ſo expounded many paſſages of it, and have wreſted them ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, that none of the Modern Writers of that <hi>Church</hi> pretend to excuſe it, I ſay, I muſt freely own to you, that when I find that I need a Commentary on dark paſſages, theſe will be the laſt perſons to whom I will addreſs my ſelf for it. Thus you ſee how fully I have opened my mind to you in this matter; I have gone over a great deal of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:48501:146"/>ground in as few words as is poſſible, becauſe hints I know are enough for you; I thank God, theſe Conſiderations do fully ſatisfie me, and I will be infinitely joyed, if they have the ſame effect on you.</p>

               <hi>A Brief Account of particulars occurring at the happy Death of our late Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lord King</hi> Charles II. <hi>in regard to Religion; faithfully related by his then Aſſiſtant, Mr.</hi> Jo. Hudleſton.</head>
            <p>UPON <hi>Thurſday</hi> the Fifth of <hi>February,</hi> 1685. Between Seven and Eight a Clock in the Evening, I was ſent for in haſte to the Queens Back-ſtairs at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and deſired to bring with me all things neceſſary for a dying Perſon. Accordingly I came, and was order'd not to ſtir from thence till further notice; being thus obliged to wait, and not having had time to bring along with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e the Moſt Holy Sacrament of the Altar, I was in ſome Anxiety how to procure it: In this conjuncture (the Divine Providence ſo diſpoſing) Father <hi>Bento de Lewis</hi> a <hi>Portugez</hi> came thither, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the circumſtance I was in, readily profer'd himſelf to go to St. <hi>James</hi>'s and bring the Moſt Holy Sacrament along with him.</p>
            <p>Soon after his departure I was call'd into the King's Bed-Chamber, where ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to the Bed ſide, and kneeling down, I in brief preſented his Majeſty with what Service I could perform for God's Honour, and the happineſs of his Soul at this laſt Moment on which Eternity depends. The King then declared himſelf: That he deſired to die in the Faith and Communion of the Holy Roman Catholick Church, That he was moſt heartily ſorry for all the Sins of his life paſt, and particularly for that he had deferred his Reconciliation ſo long; That through the Merits of Chriſt's Paſſion he hoped for Salvation, That he was in Charity with all the World; That with all his Heart he Pardon'd his Enemies and deſired Pardon of all thoſe whom he had any wiſe offended, and that if it pleaſed God to ſpare him longer life, he would amend it, deteſting all Sin.</p>
            <p>I then advertis'd his Majeſty of the benefit and neceſſity of the Sacrament of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which Advertiſement the King moſt willingly embracing, made an exact Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his whole Life, with exceeding Compunction and Tenderneſs of Heart; which ended, I deſired him, in farther ſign of Repentance and true ſorrow for his Sins, to ſay with me this little ſhort Act of Contrition.</p>
            <p>O my Lord God, with my whole Heart and Soul I deteſt all the Sins of my Life paſt for the Love of Thee, whom I love above all things, and I firmly purpoſe by thy Holy Grace never to offend thee more, <hi>Amen,</hi> Sweet Jeſus, <hi>Amen,</hi> Into thy Hands, Sweet Jeſus, I commend my Soul, Mercy, Sweet Jeſus, Mercy. This he pronounced with a clear and audible voice; which done, and his Sacramental Penance admitted, I gave him Abſolution.</p>
            <p>After ſome time thus ſpent I asked his Majeſty, if he did not alſo deſire to have the other Sacraments of the Holy Church adminiſtred unto him? He reply'd, By all means, I deſire to be partaker of all the helps and Succours neceſſary and expedient for a Catholick Chriſtian in my condition. I added, and doth not your Majeſty alſo deſire to receive the Pretious Body and Blood of our dear Saviour Jeſus Chriſt in the Moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament of the Euchariſt? His Anſwer was this: If I am worthy, pray fail not to let me have it. I then told him, it would be brought to him very ſpeedily, and deſired his Majeſty, that in the interim he would give me leave to proceed to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:48501:146"/>of Extreme Unction, he replyed with all my Heart; I then Anoyled him, which as ſoon as perform'd I was call'd to the door, whither the Bleſſed Sacrament was now brought and delivered to me.</p>
            <p>Then returning to the King, I entreated His Majeſty that he would prepare and diſpoſe himſelf to receive. At which the King raiſing up himſelf, ſaid, let me meet my Heavenly Lord in a better poſture than in my Bed. But I humbly begg'd His Majeſty to repoſe himſelf: God Almighty, who ſaw his Heart, would accept of his good intention. The King then having again recited the fore-mentioned Act of Contrition with me, he received the moſt Holy Sacrament for his Viaticum, with all the Symptoms of Devotion imaginable. The Communion being ended, I Read the uſual Prayers, termed the Recommendation of the Soul, appointed by the Church for Catholicks in his Condition. After which the King deſired the Act of Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: O my Lord God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be repeated, this done, for his laſt Spiritual encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement I ſaid,</p>
            <p>Your Majeſty hath now received the Comfort and Benefit of all the Sacraments, that a good Chriſtian (ready to depart out of this World) can have or deſire. Now it reſts only, That you think upon the Death and Paſſion of our Dear Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, of which I preſent unto you this Figure (ſhewing him a Crucifix) lift up therefore the Eyes of your Soul, and repreſent to your ſelf your ſweet Saviour here Crucified: Bowing down his Head to kiſs you: His Arms ſtretched out to Embrace you: His Body and Members all Bloody and Pale with Death to Redeem you: And as you ſee him Dead and fixed upon the Croſs for your Redemption; So have his Remembrance fixed and freſh in your Heart: beſeech him with all humility, That his moſt precious Blood may not be ſhed in vain for you: And that it will pleaſe him by the Merits of his bitter Death and Paſſion to pardon and forgive you all your Offences, and finally to receive your Soul into his Bleſſed hands, and when it ſhall pleaſe him to take it out of this Tranſitory World, to grant you a joyful Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and an Eternal Crown of Glory in the next. In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt: <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So Recommending His Majeſty on my Knees, with all the Tranſport of Devotion I was able, to the Divine Mercy and Protection, I withdrew out of the Chamber.</p>

               <hi>Some REFLECTIONS on His Majeſties Proclamation of the Twelfth of</hi> February, 1686/7. <hi>for a Toleration in</hi> Scotland, <hi>together with the ſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">I. THE Preamble of a Proclamation is oft writ in haſt, and is the flouriſh of ſome wanton Pen: but one of ſuch an extraordinary nature as this is, was probably more ſeverely Examined; there is a new deſignation of his Majeſties Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority here ſet forth of his <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> which is ſo often repeated, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be a little ſearched into. Prerogative Royal and Soveraign Authority, are Terms, already received and known; but for this <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> as it is a new Term, ſo thoſe who have coined it, may make it ſignifie what they will. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Law ſpeaks of <hi>Princeps Legibus ſolutus,</hi> and <hi>Abſolute</hi> in its natural ſignification, importing the being without all Ties and Reſtraints; then the true meaning of this ſeems to be, that there is an Inherent Power in the King, which can neither be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by Laws, Promiſes, nor Oaths; for nothing leſs than the being free from all theſe, renders a Power <hi>Abſolute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. If the former Term ſeemed to ſtretch our Allegiance, that which comes after it, is yet a ſtep of another nature, tho' one can hardly imagine what can go beyond <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Power:</hi> and it is in theſe Words, <hi>Which all our Subjects are to obey without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</hi> And this is the carrying Obedience many ſizes beyond what the Grand Seignior ever yet claimed: For all Princes, even the moſt violent Pretenders to <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> 'till <hi>Lewis</hi> the Great's time, have thought it enough to oblige their Subjects to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to their Power, and to bear whatſoever they thought good to impoſe upon them; but till the Days of the late Converſions by the Dragoons, it was never ſo much as pretended, that Subjects were bound to <hi>Obey</hi> their Prince <hi>without Reſerve;</hi> and to be of his Religion, becauſe he would have it ſo. Which was the only Argument that thoſe late Apoſtles made uſe of; ſo it is probable this qualification of the Duty of Subjects was put in here, to prepare us for a terrible <hi>le Roy le veut;</hi> and in that caſe we are
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:48501:147"/>told here, that we muſt <hi>Obey without Reſerve;</hi> and when thoſe Severe Orders come, the Privy Council, and all ſuch as execute this Proclamation, will be bound by this Declaration to ſhew themſelves more forward than any others, <hi>to obey without Reſerve:</hi> and thoſe poor pretenſions of Conſcience, Religion, Honour, and Reaſon, will be then reckoned as <hi>Reſerves</hi> upon their Obedience, which are all now ſhut out.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Theſe being the grounds upon which this Proclamation is founded, we ought not only to conſider what Conſequences are now drawn from them, but what may be drawn from them at any time hereafter; for if they are of force, to juſtify that which is inferred from them, it will be full as juſt to draw from the ſame premiſes an Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of the Proteſtant Religion, of the Rights of the Subjects, not only to Church-Lands, but to all Property whatſoever. In a word, it Aſſerts a Power to be in the King, to command what he will, and an Obligation in the Subjects, to Obey what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he ſhall Command.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. There is alſo mention made in the Preamble of the <hi>Chriſtian Love and Charity,</hi> which his Majeſty would have eſtabliſhed among Neighbours; but another daſh of a Pen, founded on this <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> may declare us all Hereticks; and then in won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Charity to us, we muſt be told, that we are either to Obey without Reſerve, or be burnt without Reſerve. We know the Charity of that Church pretty well: It is indeed fervent and burning; and if we have forgot what has been done in former Ages, <hi>France, Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Hungary</hi> have ſet before our Eyes very freſh Inſtances of the Charity of that Religion. While thoſe Examples are ſo green, it is a little too impoſing on us, to talk to us of <hi>Chriſtian Love and Charity.</hi> No doubt His Majeſty means ſincerely, and his Exactneſs to all his Promiſes, chiefly to thoſe made ſince he came to the Crown, will not ſuffer us to think an unbecoming Thought of his Royal Intentions; but yet after all, tho' it ſeems by this Proclamation, that we are bound to <hi>Obey without Reſerve,</hi> it is hardſhip upon hardſhip to be bound to <hi>Believe without Reſerve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. There are a ſort of People here Tolerated, that will be hardly found out: and theſe are the Moderate Presbyterians: Now, as ſome ſay, that there are very few of thoſe People in <hi>Scotland</hi> that deſerves this Character, ſo it is hard to tell what it amounts to; and the calling any of them Immoderate, cuts off all their ſhare in this Grace. Moderation is a quality that lyes in the mind, and how this will be found out, I cannot ſo readily gueſs. If a Standard had been given of Opinions or Practices, then one could have known how this might have been diſtinguiſhed; but as it lies, it will not be eaſy to make the Diſcrimination; and the declaring them all immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, ſhuts them out quite.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Another Foundation laid down for repealing all Laws made againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, is, That they were Enacted in King <hi>James</hi> the Sixth's Minority: with ſome harſh expreſſions, that are not to be inſiſted on, ſince they ſhew more the heat of the Penner, than the Dignity of the Prince, in whoſe name they are given out: But all theſe Laws were ratifyed over and over again by King <hi>James,</hi> when he came to be of full Age: and they have received many Confirmations by King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, as well as by his preſent Majeſty, both when he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented his Brother in the Year 1681, and ſince he himſelf came to the Crown: ſo that whatſoever may be ſaid concerning the firſt Formation of thoſe Laws, they have received now for the courſe of a whole hundred Years, that are lapſed ſince King <hi>James</hi> was full of Age, ſo many Confirmations, that if there is any thing certain in Humane Government, we might depend upon them; but this new coyned <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> muſt carry all before it.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. It is alſo well known, that the whole Settlement of the Church Lands and Tythes, with many other things, and more particularly the Eſtabliſhment of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, was likewiſe enacted in King <hi>James</hi>'s minority, as well as thoſe Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Laws: ſo that the Reaſon now made uſe of, to annul the penal Laws, will ſerve full as well for another Act of this <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> that ſhall aboliſh all thoſe; and if Maximes that unhinge all the Securities of Human Society, and all that is ſacred in Government, ought to be lookt on with the juſteſt and deepeſt prejudices poſſible, one is tempted to loſe the reſpect that is due to every thing that carries a Royal Stamp upon it, when he ſees ſuch grounds made uſe of, as muſt ſhake all Settlements what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; for if a preſcription of 120 Years, and Confirmations reiterated over and over again theſe 100 Years paſt, do not purge ſome Defects in the firſt Formation of thoſe Laws, what can make us ſecure. But this looks ſo like a fetch of the <hi>French</hi> Prerogative Law, both in their Proceſſes with Relation to the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> and thoſe concerning Dependences at <hi>Mets,</hi> that this ſeems to be a Copy from that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Original.</p>
            <pb n="283" facs="tcp:48501:147"/>
            <p n="8">VIII. It were too much ill nature to look into the Hiſtory of the laſt Age, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine on what grounds thoſe Characters of <hi>Pious</hi> and <hi>Bleſſed</hi> given to the Memory of Q <hi>Mary</hi> are built, but ſince K. <hi>James</hi>'s Memory has the Character of <hi>Glorious</hi> given to it, if the Civility of the fair Sex makes one unwilling to look into one, yet the other may be a little dwelt on. The peculiar Glory that belongs to K. <hi>James</hi>'s Memory, is, that he was a Prince of great Learning, and that he imployed it chiefly in writing for his Religion: of the Volume in Folio in which we have his Works, two thirds are againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> one part of them is a Commentary on the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, proving that the Pope is Antichriſt; another part of them belonged more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally to his Poſt Dignity; which is the warning that he gave to all the Princes and States of <hi>Europe,</hi> againſt the Treaſonable and Bloody Doctrines of the Papacy. The firſt Act he did when he came of Age, was to ſwear in Perſon with all his Family, and afterwards with all his People of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a Covenant, containing an Enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all the points of Popery, and a moſt ſolemn Renunciation of them, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like our Parliament Teſt: his firſt Speech to the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> was Copious on this Subject; and he left a Legacy of a Wiſh on ſuch of his Poſterity as ſhould go over to that Religion, which in good manners is ſuppreſſed. It is known, K. <hi>James</hi> was no Conquerour, and that he made more uſe of his Pen than his Sword: ſo the Glory that is peculiar to his Memory, muſt fall chiefly on his Learned and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Writings: and ſince there is ſuch a Veneration expreſſed for him, it agrees not ill with this, to wiſh, that his Works were more ſtudied by thoſe who offer ſuch Incenſe to his <hi>Glorious</hi> Memory.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. His Majeſty aſſures his People of <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon a certain Knowledge and long Experience, that the Catholicks, as they are good Chriſtians, ſo they are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe dutiful Subjects: but if we muſt believe both theſe equally, then we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſeverely againſt their being Good Chriſtians; for we are ſure they can never be good Subjects, not only to a Heretical Prince if he does not extirpate Hereticks; for their beloved Council of the Lateran, that decreed Tranſubſtantiation, has likewiſe decreed, that if a Prince does not extirpate Hereticks out of his Dominions, the Pope muſt depoſe him, and declare his Subjects abſolved from their Allegiance, and give his Dominions to another: ſo that even his Majeſty, how much ſoever he may be a Zealous Catholick, yet he cannot be aſſured of their fidelity to him, unleſs he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them ſecret aſſurances, that he is reſolved to extirpate Hereticks out of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions; and that all the Promiſes which he now makes to theſe poor wretches, are no other way to be kept, than the Aſſurances which the Great <hi>Lewis</hi> gave to his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Subjects, of his obſerving ſtill the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> even after he had reſolved to break it, and alſo his laſt promiſe made in the Edict, that repealed the Edict of <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> by which he gave Aſſurances that no violence ſhould be uſed to any for their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in the very time that he was ordering all poſſible Violences to be put in execution againſt them.</p>
            <p n="10">X. His Majeſty aſſures us, that on all Occaſions the Papiſts have ſhewed themſelves good and faithful Subjects to him and his Royal Predeceſſors; but how <hi>Abſolute</hi> ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the King's <hi>Power</hi> may be, it ſeems his Knowledge of Hiſtory is not ſo Abſolute, but it may be capable of ſome Improvement. It will be hard to find out what Loyalty they ſhewed on the Gunpowder Plot, or during the whole progreſs of the Rebellion of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> if the King will either take the words of King <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Glorious</hi> Memory, or K. <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, that was indeed of <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>bleſſed</hi> Memory, rather than the penners of this Proclamation, it will not be hard to find Occaſions where they were a little wanting in this their ſo much boaſted Loyalty: and we are ſure, that by the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of that Religion, the King can never be aſſured of the Fidelity of thoſe he calls his Catholick Subjects, but by engaging to them to make his Heretical Subjects Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices to their Rage.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. The King declares them capable of all the Offices and <hi>Benefices</hi> which he ſhall think fit to beſtow on them, and only reſtrains them from invading the Proteſtant Churches by force: ſo that here a door is plainly opened for admitting them to the Exerciſe of their Religion in Proteſtant Churches, ſo they do not break into them by force; and whatſoever may be the Senſe of the term <hi>Benefice</hi> in its antient and firſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, now it ſtands only for Church Preferments; ſo that when any Churches, that are at the King's Gift, fall vacant, here is a plain intimation, that they are to be provided to them; and then it is very probable, that all the Laws made againſt ſuch as go not to their pariſh Churches, will be ſeverely turned upon thoſe that will not come to Maſs.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. His Majeſty does in the next place, in the vertue of his <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> Annul a great many Laws, as well thoſe that Eſtabliſhed the Oaths of Allegiance and Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as the late Teſt, enacted by himſelf in perſon, while he repreſented his Brother: upon which he gave as ſtrange an Eſſay to the World of his abſolute Juſtice in the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:48501:148"/>of the late Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> as he does now of his <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> in condemning the Teſt it ſelf; he alſo repeals his own Confirmation of the Teſt, ſince he came to the Crown, which he offered as the cleareſt Evidence that he could give of his Reſolution to maintain the Proteſtant Religion, and by which he gained ſo much upon that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he obtained every thing from them that he deſired of them; till he came to try them in the Matters of Religion. This is no Extraordinary Evidence to aſſure his People, that his Promiſes will be like the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not; nor will the diſgrace of the Commiſſioner that Enacted that Law, lay this matter wholly on him; for the Letter, that he brought, the Speech that he made, and the Inſtructions which he got, are all too well known to be ſo ſoon forgotten; and if Princes will give their Subjects reaſon to think, that they forget their Promiſes, as ſoon as the turn is ſerved for which they were made, this will be too prevailing a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the Subjects to mind the Princes promiſe as little as it ſeems he himſelf does, and will force them to conclude, that the Truth of the Prince, is not ſo abſolute as it ſeems he fancies his Power to be.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. Here is not only a repealing of a great many Laws, and eſtabliſhed Oaths and Teſts, but by the Exerciſe of the <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> a new Oath is impoſed, which was never pretended to by the Crown in any former time, and as the Oath is Created by this <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> ſo it ſeems the <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> muſt be ſupported by this Oath: ſince one branch of it, is an Obligation to maintain his Majeſty and his Lawful Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in the Exerciſe of this their <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> againſt all deadly, which I ſuppoſe is <hi>Scotch</hi> for Mortals: now to impoſe ſo hard a yoke as this <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> on the Subject, ſeems no ſmall ſtretch; but it is a wonderful exerciſe of it to oblige the Subjects to defend this: it had been more modeſt, if they had been only bound to bear it, and ſubmit to it: but it is a terrible thing ſo far to extinguiſh all the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of natural Liberty, or of a Legal Government, as to oblige the Subjects by Oath to maintain the Exerciſe of this, which plainly muſt deſtroy themſelves: for the ſhort execution by the Bow-ſtrings of <hi>Turkey,</hi> or by ſending Orders to Men to return in their Heads, being an Exerciſe of this <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> it is a little too hard to make men ſwear to maintain the King in it, and if that Kingdom has ſuffered ſo much by the many Oaths that have been in uſe among them, as is marked in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, I am afraid this new Oath will not much mend the matter.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. Yet after all, there is ſome Comfort; his Majeſty aſſures them, he will uſe no Violence nor Force, nor any <hi>Invincible Neceſſity</hi> to any man on the account of his perſwaſion: It were too great a want of reſpect to fancy, that a time may come in which even this may be remembred, full as well, as the promiſes that were made to the Parliament after his Majeſty came to the Crown; I do not I confeſs, apprehend that; for I ſee here ſo great a Caution uſed in the choice of theſe words, that it is plain, very great Severities may very well conſiſt with them: It is clear, that the general words of Violence and Force are to be determined by the laſt <hi>Invincible Neceſſity,</hi> ſo that the King does only promiſe to lay no <hi>Invincible Neceſſity</hi> on his Subjects; but for all Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities that are not Invincible, it ſeems they muſt bear a large ſhare of them; Diſgraces, want of imployments, Fines and Impriſonments, and even Death it ſelf are all vinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things to a man of a firmneſs of mind: ſo that the Violences of Torture, the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Dragoons, and ſome of the Methods now practiſed in <hi>France,</hi> perhaps may be included within this Promiſe; ſince theſe ſeem almoſt <hi>Invincible</hi> to Humane Nature, if it is not fortified with an Extraordinary meaſure of Grace: but as to all other things, his Majeſty binds himſelf up from no part of the Exerciſe of his <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> by this Promiſe.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. His Majeſty Orders this to go Immediatly to the Great Seal, without paſſing through the other Seals: now ſince this is Counter-ſigned by the Secretary in whoſe hands the Signet is, there was no other ſtep to be made but through the Privy Seal; ſo I muſt own I have a great Curioſity of knowing his Character in whoſe hands the Privy Seal is at preſent; for it ſeems his Conſcience is not ſo very ſupple, as the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors and the Secretaries are; but it is very likely, if he does not quickly change his Mind, the Privy Seal at leaſt will quickly change his Keeper; and I am ſorry to hear, that the Lord Chancellor and Secretary have not another Brother to fill this poſt, that ſo the guilt of the ruine of that Nation, may lie on one ſingle Family, and that there may be no others involved in it.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. Upon the whole matter many ſmaller things being waved, it being extream unpleaſant to find fault, where one has all poſſible diſpoſitions to pay all reſpect; we here in <hi>England</hi> ſee what we muſt look for. A Parliament in <hi>Scotland</hi> was try'd, but it proved a little ſtubborn; and now <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> comes to ſet all right; ſo when the Cloſetting has gone round, ſo that Noſes are counted, we may perhaps ſee a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here; but if it chances to be untoward, and not to <hi>Obey without Reſerve,</hi> then
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:48501:148"/>our Reverend Judges will copy from <hi>Scotland,</hi> and will not only tell us of the King's Imperial Power, but will diſcover to us this new Myſtery of <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> to which we are all bound <hi>to Obey without Reſerve.</hi>

            <p>We have taken into our Royal Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the many and great inconveniencies which have happened to that our Ancient King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Scotland</hi> of late years, through the different perſwaſions in the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, through the great Heats and Animoſities amongſt the ſeveral Profeſſors thereof, to the ruin and decay of Trade, waſting of Lands, extinguiſhing of Charity, contempt of the Royal Power: and converting of true Religion, and the Fear of God, into Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities, Names, Fractions, and ſometimes into Sacrilege and Treaſon. And being reſolved as much as in us lies, to Unite the Hearts and Affections of Our Subjects, to GOD in Religion, to Us in Loyalty, and to their Neighbours in <hi>Chriſtian Love and Charity.</hi> Have therefore thoughe fit to Grant, and by our Soveraign Authority, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative Royal, and <hi>Abſolute Power, which all our Subjects are to Obey without Reſerve;</hi> Do hereby give and grant Our Royal Toleration, to the ſeveral Profeſſors of the Chriſtian Religion after named, with, and under the ſeveral Conditions, Reſtrictions, and Limitations after-mentioned. In the firſt place, We Allow and Tolerate the Moderate Presbyterians to Meet in their Private Houſes, and there to hear all ſuch Miniſters, as either have, or are willing to accept of Our Indulgence allanerly, and none other, and that there be not any thing ſaid or done contrary to the Well and Peace of Our Reign, Seditious or Treaſonable, under the higheſt Pains theſe Crimes will import; nor are they to preſume to Build Meeting-Houſes, or to uſe Out-Houſes or Barns, but only to Exerciſe in their Private Houſes, as ſaid is: In the mean time, it is our Royal Will and Pleaſure, that Field-Conventicles, and ſuch as Preach, or Exerciſe at them, or who ſhall any ways aſſiſt or connive at them, ſhall be proſecuted according to the utmoſt Severity of our Laws made againſt them, ſeeing from theſe Rendezvouzes of Rebellion, ſo much Diſorder hath proceeded, and ſo much Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance to the Government, and for which after this Our Royal Indulgence for ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſciences there is no Excuſe left. In like manner, we do hereby tolerate Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers to meet and Exerciſe in their Form, in any place or places appointed for their Worſhip. And conſidering the Severe and Cruel <hi>Laws</hi> made againſt <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> (therein called <hi>Papiſts</hi>) in the Minority of Our Royal Grand-Father of * <hi>Glorious</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, without His Conſent, and contrary to the Duty of good Subjects, by His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, and other Enemies to their Lawful Soveraigns Our Royal Great Grand-Mother Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Bleſſed</hi> and <hi>Pious</hi> Memory, wherein, under the pretence of Religion, they cloathed the worſt of Treaſons, Factions, and Uſurpations, and made theſe <hi>Laws,</hi> not as againſt the Enemies of GOD, but their own; which <hi>Laws</hi> have ſtill been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued of courſe without deſign of executing them, or any of them, <hi>ad terrorem</hi> only, on Suppoſition, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> relying on an External Power, were incapable of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and true Allegiance to their Natural Soveraign, and Rightful Monarchs; We of Our certain Knowledge, and long Experience, knowing that the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> as it is their Principle to be good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſo it is to be dutiful Subjects; and that they have likewiſe on all Occaſions ſhewn themſelves Good and Faithful Subjects to Us, and our Royal Predeceſſors, by hazarding, and many of them actually loſing their Lives and Fortunes, in their Defence (though of another Religion) and the Maintenance of their Authority againſt the Violences and Treaſons of the moſt violent Abettors of theſe <hi>Laws:</hi> Do therefore with Advice and Conſent of Our Privy Council, by Our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Authority, Prerogative Royal, and <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> aforeſaid, Suſpend, Stop, and diſable all Laws or Acts of Parliament, Cuſtoms or Conſtitutions, made or execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt any of our <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Subjects, in any time paſt, to all intents and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, making void all Prohibitions therein mentioned, pains or penalties therein or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd to be Inflicted, ſo that they ſhall in all things be as free in all Reſpects whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, not only to Exerciſe their Religion, but to enjoy all <hi>Offices, Benefices,</hi> and others, which We ſhall think fit to beſtow upon them in all time coming: Nevertheleſs, it is our Will and Pleaſure, and we do hereby command all <hi>Catholicks</hi> at their higheſt Pains, only to Exerciſe their Religious Worſhip in Houſes or Chappels; and that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume not to Preach in the open Fields, or to invade the Proteſtant Churches by force,

And to this effect, We do by Our Royal Authority aforeſaid, Stop, Diſable, and Diſpenſe with all <hi>Laws</hi> enjoyning the ſaid <hi>Oaths, Teſts,</hi> or any of them, particularly the firſt Act of the firſt Seſſion of the firſt Parliament of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second; the Eleventh Act of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Seſſion of the foreſaid Parliament, the ſixth Act of the third Parliament of the ſaid King <hi>Charles;</hi> the twenty firſt and twenty fifth Acts of that Parliament, and the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Act of the firſt Seſſion of * Our late Parliament, in ſo far allanerly as concerns the taking the <hi>Oaths or Teſts</hi> therein preſcrib'd, and all others, as well not mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as mentioned, and that in place of them, all our good Subjects, or ſuch of them as We or our Privy Council ſhall require ſo to do, ſhall take and ſwear the following Oath allanerly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> A. B. <hi>do acknowledge, teſtifie and declare, that</hi> JAMES <hi>the Seventh, by the Grace of God, King of</hi> Scotland, England, France <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is rightful King and Supream Governour of theſe Realms, and over all perſons therein; and that it is unlawful for Subjects, on any pretence, or for any cauſe whatſoever, to riſe in Arms againſt Him, or any Commiſſionated by Him; and that I ſhall never ſo riſe in Arms, nor aſſiſt any who ſhall ſo do; and that I ſhall never reſiſt His Power or Authority, nor ever oppoſe His Authority to His Perſon, as I ſhall anſwer to God; but ſhall to the utmoſt of my power Aſſiſt, Defend, and Maintain Him, His Heirs and Lawful Succeſſors, in the Exerciſe of their</hi> Abſolute Power <hi>and</hi> Authority <hi>againſt all Deadly.</hi> So help me God.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing many of Our good Subjects have before Our pleaſure in theſe Matters was made publick, incurred the Guilt appointed by the Acts of Parliament above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, or others; We, by Our Authority, and <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> and Prerogative Royal above-mentioned, of Our certain Knowledge, and innate Mercy, give Our ample and full Indemnity to all thoſe of the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> or <hi>Popiſh Religion,</hi> for all things by them done contrary to Our Laws, or Acts of Parliament, made in any time paſt, relating to their Religion, the Worſhip and Exerciſe thereof, or for being Papiſts, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, or Traffickers, for hearing, or ſaying of Maſs, concealing of Prieſts or Jeſuits, breeding their Children Catholicks at home or abroad, or any other thing, Rite or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, ſaid, performed, or maintained by them, or any of them: And likewiſe, for holding or taking of Places, Employments, or Offices, contrary to any Law or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, Advices given to Us, or our Council, Actions done, or generally any thing perform'd or ſaid againſt the known Laws of that Our Ancient Kingdom: Excepting always from this Our Royal Indemnity, all Murthers, Aſſaſſinations, Thefts, and ſuch like other Crimes, which never uſed to be comprehended in Our General Acts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity. And We command and require all Our Judges, or others concerned, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this in the moſt ample Senſe and Meaning Acts of Indemnity at any time have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: Declaring this ſhall be as good to every one concerned, as if they had Our Royal Pardon and Remiſſion under Our Great Seal of that Kingdom. And likewiſe indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Our Proteſtant Subjects from all pains and penalties due for hearing or preaching in Houſes; providing there be no Treaſonable Speeches uttered in the ſaid Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles by them, in which caſe the Law is only to take place againſt the Guilty, and none other preſent; providing alſo, that they Reveal to any of Our Council the Guilt ſo committed; As alſo, excepting all Fines, or Effects of Sentences already given. And likewiſe Indemnifying fully and freely all Quakers, for their Meetings and Worſhip, in all time paſt, preceeding the publication of theſe preſents. And we doubt not but Our Proteſtant Subjects will give their Aſſiſtance and Concourſe hereunto, on all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, in their Reſpective Capacities. In conſideration whereof, and the eaſe thoſe of Our Religion, and others may have hereby, and for the Encouragement of Our Proteſtant
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:48501:149"/>Biſhops, and the Regular Clergy, and ſuch as have hitherto lived orderly, We think fit to declare, that it never was Our Principle, nor will We ever ſuffer Violence to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to any Man's Conſcience, nor will We uſe Force, or <hi>Invincible Neceſſity</hi> againſt any Man on the account of his Perſwaſion, nor the Proteſtant Religion, but will protect Our Biſhops and other Minſters in their Functions, Rights and Properties, and all Our Proteſtant Subjects in the free Exerciſe of their Proteſtant Religion in the Churches. And that We will, and hereby promiſe, on Our Royal Word, to maintain the poſſeſſors of Church Lands formerly belonging to Abbeys, or other Churches of the Catholick Religion, in their full and free poſſeſſion and right, according to Our Laws and Acts of Parliament in that behalf in all time coming. And We will imploy indifferently all our Subjects of all Perſwaſions, ſo as none ſhall meet with any Diſcouragement on the account of his Religion, but be advanced, and eſteemed by Us, according to their ſeveral Capacities and Qualifications, ſo long as We find Charity and Unity maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And if any Animoſities ſhall ariſe, as We hope in God there will not, We will ſhew the ſevereſt Effects of Our Royal Diſpleaſure againſt the Beginners or Fomenters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſeeing thereby Our Subjects may de deprived of this general Eaſe and Satisfaction, We intend to all of them, whoſe Happineſs, Proſperity, Wealth and Safety, is ſo much Our Royal Care, that We will leave nothing undone which may procure theſe Bleſſings for them. And laſtly, to the End all our good Subjects may have Notice of this Our Royal Will and Pleaſure, We do hereby command, Our <hi>Lyon</hi> King at Arms, and his Brethren Heraulds, Macers, Purſevants and Meſſengers at Arms, to make ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Proclamation thereof at the Marcat-Croſs of <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> And beſides the print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Publiſhing of this Our Royal Proclamation, it is Our expreſs Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that the ſame <hi>be paſt under the great Seal of that Our Kingdom per ſaltum,</hi> * without paſſing any other Seal or Regiſter. In Order whereunto, this ſhall be to the Directors of Our Chancelary, and their Deputies for writing the ſame, and to Our Chancellor for cauſing our Great Seal aforeſaid, to be appended thereunto, a ſufficient Warrand.</p>

            <p>IT having pleaſed Almighty God not only to bring Us to the Imperial Crown of theſe Kingdoms through the greateſt difficulties, but to preſerve Us by a more than ordinary Providence upon the Throne of Our Royal Anceſtors, there is nothing now that we ſo earneſtly deſire, as to Eſtabliſh our Government on ſuch a Foundation, as may make Our Subjects happy, and unite them to Us by Inclination as well as by Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Which We think can be done by no Means ſo effectually, as by granting to them the free Exerciſe of their Religion for the time to come, and add that to the perfect Enjoyment of their Property, which has never been in any caſe Invaded by Us ſince Our coming to the Crown: Which being the two things Men value moſt, ſhall ever be preſerved in theſe Kingdoms, during Our Reign over them, as the trueſt Methods of their Peace and Our Glory. We cannot but heartily wiſh, as it will eaſily be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, That all the People of Our Dominions were Members of the Catholick Church, yet We humbly thank Almighty God, it is, and hath of long time been Our conſtant Senſe and Opinion (which upon diverſe Occaſions We have Declared) That Conſcience ought not to be conſtrained, nor People forced in Matters of meer Religion: It has ever been directly contrary to Our Inclination, as We think it is to the Intereſt of Government, which it deſtroys by Spoiling Trade, Depopulating Countries, and Diſcouraging Strangers; and finally, that it never obtained the End for which it was employed: And in this We are the more confirmed by the Reflections We have made upon the Conduct of the Four laſt Reigns. For after all the frequent and preſſing Endeavours that were uſed in each of them, to reduce this Kingdom to an exact Conformity in Religion, it is viſible the Succeſs has not anſwered the Deſign, and that the Difficulty is invincible.

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:48501:150"/>unto all Our Loving Subjects, that they may live at Eaſe and Quiet, and for the increaſe of Trade, and encouragement of Strangers, have thought fit by virtue of Our Royal Prerogative, to Iſſue forth this Our Royal Declaration of Indulgence; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no doubt of the Concurrence of Our Two Houſes of Parliament, when We ſhall think it convenient for them to Meet.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place We do Declare, That We will Protect and Maintain Our Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Biſhops, and Clergy, and all other our Subjects of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the free Exerciſe of their Religion, as by Law Eſtabliſhed, and in the quiet and full En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of all their Poſſeſſions, without any Moleſtation or Diſturbance whatſoever.</p>
            <p>We do likewiſe Declare, That it is Our Royal Will and Pleaſure, That from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth the Execution of all and all manner of Penal Laws in Matters Eccleſiaſtical, for not coming to Church, or not Receiving the Sacrament, or for any other Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Religion Eſtabliſhed, or for or by reaſon of the Exerciſe of Religion in any manner whatſoever, be immediately Suſpended; And the further Execution of the ſaid Penal Laws and every of them is hereby Suſpended.</p>
            <p>And to the end that by the Liberty hereby Granted, the Peace and Security of Our Government in the Practice thereof may not be endangered, We have thought fit, and do hereby ſtraitly Charge and Command all Our Loving Subjects, That as We do freely give them Leave to Meet and Serve God after their own Way and Manner, be it in private Houſes, or Places purpoſely Hired or Built for that uſe: So that they take eſpecial care, that nothing be Preached or Taught amongſt them which may any ways tend to Alienate the Hearts of Our people from Us or Our Government; and that their Meetings and Aſſemblies be peaceably, openly, and publickly held, and all Perſons freely admitted to them; And that they do ſignifie and make known to ſome one or more of the next Juſtices of the Peace, what place or places they ſet apart for thoſe uſes.</p>
            <p>And that all Our Subjects may enjoy ſuch their Religious Aſſemblies with greater Aſſurance and Protection, We have thought it Requiſite, and do hereby Command, That no Diſturbance of any kind be made or given unto them, under pain of our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and to be further proceeded againſt with the uttermoſt Severity.</p>
            <p>And foraſmuch as We are deſirous to have the Benefit of the Service of all Our Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Subjects, which by the Law of Nature is inſeparably annexed to, and inherent in Our Royal Perſon; And that none of Our Subjects may for the future be under any Diſcouragement or Diſability (who are otherwiſe well inclined and fit to ſerve Us) by reaſon of ſome Oaths or Teſts, that have been uſually Adminiſtred on ſuch Occaſions: We do hereby further Declare, That it is Our Royal Will and Pleaſure, That the Oaths commonly called, <hi>The Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance,</hi> and alſo the ſeveral Teſts and Declarations mentioned in the Acts of Parliament made in the 25th and 30th Years of the Reign of Our late Royal Brother King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, ſhall not at any time hereafter be required to be Taken, Declared, or Subſcribed by any perſon or perſons whatſoever, who is or ſhall be Employed in any Office or Place of Truſt, either Civil or Military, under Us or in Our Government.

            <p>And to the end that all Our Loving Subjects may receive and enjoy the full Benefit and Advantage of Our Gracious Indulgence hereby intended, and may be Acquitted and Diſcharged from all Pains, Penalties, Forfeitures, and Diſabilities by them or any of them incurred or forfeited, or which they ſhall or may at any time hereafter be liable to, for or by reaſon of their Non-conformity, or the Exerciſe of their Religion, and from all Suits, Troubles, or Diſturbances for the ſame: We do hereby give Our Free and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Pardon unto all Non-conformiſts, Recuſants, and other Our Loving Subjects, for all Crimes and Things by them commited or done contrary to the Penal Laws formerly made relating to Religion, and the Profeſſion or Exerciſe thereof, Hereby Declaring, That this Our Royal pardon and Indempnity ſhall be as Good and Effectual to all intents and purpoſes, as if every individual perſon had been therein particularly named, or had particular Pardons under Our Great Seal, which We do likewiſe Declare ſhall from time to time be Granted unto any perſon or perſons deſiring the ſame: Willing and Requiring Our Judges, Juſtices, and other Officers, to take Notice of and Obey Our Royal Will and Pleaſure herein before Declared.</p>

               <hi>A LETTER, containing ſome Reflections on His Majeſties Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience, Dated the Fourth of</hi> April, 1687.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p n="1">I. I Thank you for the Favour of ſending me the late <hi>Declaration</hi> that His Majeſty has granted for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience.</hi> I confeſs, I longed for it with great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, and was ſurpriſed to find it ſo different from the <hi>Scotch</hi> Pattern; for I imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that it was to be ſet to the ſecond part of the ſame tune: nor can I ſee why the Penners of this have ſunk ſo much in their ſtile; for I ſuppoſe the ſame Men penned both. I expected to have ſeen the Imperial Language of <hi>Abſolute Power, to which all the Subjects are to Obey without reſerve; and of the Caſſing, Annulling, the ſtopping and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling of Laws</hi> ſet forth in the Preamble and body of this <hi>Declaration:</hi> whereas thoſe dreadful words are not to be found here: for inſtead of <hi>Repealing the Laws,</hi> his Majeſty pretends by this only to <hi>Suſpend them;</hi> and though in effect this amounts to a <hi>Repeal,</hi> yet it muſt be confeſſed that the words are ſofter. Now ſince the <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> to which his Majeſty pretends in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is not founded on ſuch poor things as <hi>Law;</hi> for that would look as if it were the gift of the People; but on the Divine Authority, which is ſuppoſed to be delegated to his Majeſty, this may be as well claimed in <hi>England</hi> as it was in <hi>Scotland:</hi> and the pretentions to <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> is ſo great a thing, that ſince his Majeſty thought fit once to claim it, he is little beholding to thoſe that make him fall ſo much in his Language, eſpecially ſince both theſe <hi>Declarations</hi> have appeared in our <hi>Gazettes;</hi> ſo that as we ſee what is done in <hi>Scotland,</hi> we know from hence what is in ſome peoples hearts, and what we may expect in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. His Majeſty tells his people, that <hi>the perfect Injoyment of their Property has never been in any Caſe invaded by him ſince his coming to the Crown.</hi> This is indeed matter of great Incouragement to all good Subjects; for it lets them ſee that ſuch Invaſions as have been made on <hi>Property,</hi> have been done without his Majeſties knowledge: ſo that no doubt the continuing to levy the <hi>Cuſtomes</hi> and the <hi>Additional Exciſe</hi> (which had been granted only during the late King's Life,) before the Parliament could meet to renew the Grant, was done without his Majeſties knowledge; the many Violences commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not only by <hi>Soldiers,</hi> but <hi>Officers,</hi> in all the parts of <hi>England,</hi> which are ſevere Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions on <hi>Property,</hi> have been all without his Majeſties knowledge; and ſince the firſt Branch of <hi>Property</hi> is the Right that a man has to his Life, the ſtrange Eſſay of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan Government,</hi> that was ſhewed at <hi>Taunton;</hi> and the no leſs ſtrange proceedings of the preſent Lord Chancellour, in his Circuit after the Rebellion (which are very juſtly called his Campagne, for it was an open Act of Hoſtility to all Law) and for which and other Services of the like nature, it is believed he has had the reward of the great Seal, and the Executions of thoſe who have left their Colours, which being founded on no Law, are no other than ſo many murders; all theſe, I ſay, are as we are ſure, Invaſions on Property; but ſince the King tells us, that no ſuch Invaſions have been made ſince he came to the Crown, we muſt conclude that all theſe things have fallen out without his privity. And if a ſtanding Army, in time of Peace, has been ever lookt on by this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as an Attempt upon the whole Property of the Nation in groſs, one muſt conclude, that even this is done without his Majeſties knowledge.</p>
            <p n="3">III. His Majeſty expreſſes his Charity for us in a kind wiſh, that we were all Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Catholick Church; in return to which we offer up daily our moſt earneſt Prayers for him, that he may become a Member of the truly Catholick Church: for Wiſhes and Prayers do no hurt on no ſide: but his Majeſty adds, that it has ever been his Opinion, that Conſcience ought not to be conſtrain'd, nor people forced in matters of meer Religion. We are very happy if this continues to be always his ſenſe: but we are ſure in this he is no Obedient Member of that which he means by the Catholick Church: for it has over and over again decreed the Extirpation of Hereticks. It en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages Princes to it, by the Offer of the pardon of their Sins; it threatens them to
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:48501:151"/>it, by denouncing to them not only the Judgments of God, but that which is more ſenſible, the loſs of their Dominions: and it ſeems they intend to make us know that part of their Doctrine even before we come to feel it, ſince tho' ſome of that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion would take away the horror which the Fourth Council of the <hi>Lateran</hi> gives us, in which theſe things were decreed, by denying it to be a General Council, and rejecting the Authority of thoſe Canons, yet the moſt learned of all the <hi>Apoſtates</hi> that has fallen to them from our Church, has ſo lately given up this Plea, and has ſo formally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the Authority of that Council, and of its Canons, that it ſeems they think they are bound to this piece of fair dealing, of warning us before hand of our Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. It is true <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſays, <q>The Church does not always execute the Power of Depoſing Heretical Princes, tho' ſhe always retains it: one Reaſon that he aſſigns, is, Becauſe ſhe is not at all times able to put it in Execution:</q> ſo the ſame reaſon may perhaps make it appear unadviſeable to Extirpate Hereticks, becauſe that at preſent it cannot be done; but the Right remains intire, and is put in execution in ſuch an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting manner in all places where that Religion prevails, that it has a very ill Grace, to ſee any Member of that Church ſpeak in this ſtrain; and when neither the Policy of <hi>France,</hi> nor the Greatneſs of their Monarch, nor yet the Intereſts of the Emperour, joyned to the Gentleneſs of his own temper, could withſtand theſe Bloody Councils, that are indeed parts of that Religion, we can ſee no reaſon to induce us to believe that a Toleration of Religion is propoſed with any other deſign but either to divide us, or to lay us aſleep till it is time to give the Alarm for deſtroying us.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. If all the Endeavours, that have been uſed in the laſt four Reigns, for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Subjects of this Kingdom to an Unity in Religion have been ineffectual, as His Majeſty ſays; we know to whom we owe both the firſt beginnings, and the progreſs of the Diviſions among our ſelves; the gentleneſs of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Government, and the numbers of thoſe that adhered to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> made it ſcarce poſſible to put an end to that Party during her Reign, which has been ever ſince reſtleſs, and has had Credit enough at Court during the three laſt Reigns, not only to ſupport it ſelf, but to diſtract us, and to divert us from apprehending the danger of being ſwallowed up by them, by fomenting our own Differences, and by ſetting on either a Toleration or a Perſecution, as it has happened to ſerve their Intereſts. It is not ſo very long ſince, that nothing was to be heard at Court but the ſupporting the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Extirpating all the Nonconformiſts: and it were eaſie to name the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, if it were decent, that had this in their mouths; but now all is turned round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the Church of <hi>England</hi> is in Diſgrace; and now the Encouragement of Trade, the Quiet of the Nation, and the Freedom of Conſcience are again in Vogue, that were ſuch odious things but a few Years ago, that the very mentioning them was enough to load any Man with Suſpicions as backward in the King's Service; while ſuch Methods are uſed, and the Government as if in an Ague, divided between hot and cold fits, no wonder if Laws ſo unſteadily executed have failed of their effect.</p>
            <p n="5">V. There is a good reſerve here left for Severity, when the proper Opportunity to ſet it on preſents it ſelf: for his Majeſty declares himſelf only againſt the forcing of men in matters of meer Religion: ſo that whenſoever Religion and Policy come to be ſo interwoven, that meer Religion is not the Caſe, and that publick Safety may be pretended, then this Declaration is to be no more claimed: ſo that the faſtning any thing upon the Proteſtant Religion, that is inconſiſtent with the publick Peace, will be pretended to ſhew that they are not perſecuted for meer Religion. In <hi>France,</hi> when it was reſolved to extirpate the Proteſtants, all the Diſcourſes that were written on that Subject were full of the Wars occaſioned by thoſe of the Religion in the laſt Age, tho' as theſe was the happy occaſions of bringing the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon</hi> to the Crown, they had been ended above 80 Years ago, and there had not been ſo much as the leaſt Tumult raiſed by them theſe 50 Years paſt: ſo that the <hi>French</hi> who have ſmarted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Severity, could not be charged with the leaſt Infraction of the Law; yet Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of a hundred years old were raiſed up to inſpire into the King thoſe Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of them, which have produced the terrible effects that are viſible to all the World. There is another Expreſſion in this Declaration, which lets us likewiſe ſee with what Caution the Offers of favour are now worded, that ſo there may be an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion given when the time and Conjuncture ſhall be favourable to break through them all: it is in theſe words, So that they take eſpecial Care that nothing be preached or taught amongſt them, which may any ways tend to alienate the hearts of our People from Us or Our Government. This in it ſelf is very reaſonable; and could admit of no Exception, if we had not to do with a ſet of men, who to our great Misfortune have ſo much Credit with His Majeſty, and who will be no ſooner lodged in the Power to which they pretend, then they will make every thing that is preached againſt Popery paſs for that which may in ſome manner alienate the Subjects from the King.</p>
            <pb n="291" facs="tcp:48501:151"/>
            <p n="6">VI. His Majeſty makes no doubt of the Concurrence of his Two Houſes of Parliament, when he ſhall think it convenient for them to meet. The hearts of Kings are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable, ſo that it is a little too preſumptuous to look into his Majeſties ſecret thoughts: but according to the Judgments that we would make of other mens thoughts by their Actions, one would be tempted to think, that his Majeſty made ſome doubt of it, ſince his Affairs both at home and abroad could not go the worſe, if it appeared that there was a perfect underſtanding between him and His Parliament, and that his people were ſupporting him with freſh Supplies; and this Houſe of Commons is ſo much at his Devotion, that all the World ſaw how ready they were to grant every thing that he could deſire of them, till he began to lay off the Mask with relation to the Teſt, and ſince that time the frequent Prorogations, the Cloſetting, and the pains that has been taken to gain Members, by Promiſes made to ſome, and the Diſgraces of others, would make one a little inclined to think, that ſome doubt was made of their Concurrence. But we muſt confeſs, that the depth of his Majeſties Judgment is ſuch, that we cannot fathom it, and therefore we cannot gueſs what his Doubts or his Aſſurances are. It is true, the words that come after unriddle the Miſtery a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, which are, when his Majeſty ſhall think it convenient for them to meet: for the meaning of this ſeems plain, that His Majeſty is reſolved that they ſhall never meet, till he receives ſuch Aſſurances, in a new round of Cloſetting, that he ſhall be put out of doubt concerning it.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. I will not enter into the Diſpute concerning Liberty of Conſcience, and the Reaſons that may be offered for it to a Seſſion of Parliament; for there is ſcarce any one point, that either with relation to Religion, or Politicks, affords a greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of matter for Reflection: and I make no doubt to ſay, that there is abundance of Reaſon to oblige Parliaments to review all the Penal Laws, either with relation to Papiſts, or to Diſſenters: but I will take the boldneſs to add one thing, that the King's Suſpending of Laws ſtrikes at the root of this whole Government, and ſubverts it quite: for if there is any thing certain with relation to Engliſh Government, it is this that the Executive Power of the Law is entirely in the King; and the Law to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie him in the Management of it has cloathed him with a vaſt Prerogative, and made it unlawful on any pretence whatſoever to reſiſt him: whereas on the other hand, the <hi>Legiſlative Power</hi> is not ſo entirely in the King, but that the Lords and Commons have ſuch a ſhare in it, that no Law can either be made, repealed, or which is all one ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but by their conſent; ſo that the placing this <hi>Legiſlative Power</hi> ſingly in the King, is a ſubverſion of this whole Government, ſince the Eſſence of all Governments conſiſts in the Subjects of the Legiſlative Authority, Acts of Violence or Injuſtice, committed in the Executive part, are ſuch things that all Princes being ſubject to them, the peace of mankind were very ill ſecured if it were not unlawful to reſiſt upon any pretence ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from any ill Adminiſtrations, in which as the Law may be doubtful, ſo the Facts may be uncertain, and at worſt the publick Peace muſt always be more valued than any private Oppreſſions or Injuries whatſoever. But the total Subverſion of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, being ſo contrary to the Truſt that is given to the Prince who ought to execute it, will put men upon uneaſie and dangerous Inquiries: which will turn little to the Advantage of thoſe who are driving matters to ſuch a doubtful and deſperate Iſſue.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. If there is any thing in which the Exerciſe of the <hi>Legiſlative Power</hi> ſeems in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable, it is in thoſe Oaths of Allegiance and Teſts, that are thought neceſſary to Qualifie men either to be admitted to enjoy the protection of the Law, or to bear a ſhare in the Government; for in theſe the Security of the Government is chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; and therefore the total Extinction of theſe, as it is not only a Suſpenſion of of them, but a plain repealing of them, ſo it is a Subverting of the whole Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Government: For the Regulation that King and Parliament had ſet both for the Subjects having the protection of the State by the Oath of Allegiance, and for a ſhare in the places of Truſt by the Teſts, is now pluckt up by the roots; when it is declared, That theſe ſhall not at any time hereafter be required to be taken or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by any perſons whatſoever: for it is plain, that this is no Suſpenſion of the Law, but a formal repeal of it, in as plain words as can be conceived.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. His Majeſty ſays, that the Benefit of the Service of all his Subjects is by the Law of Nature inſeparably annexed to and inherent in his Sacred Perſon. It is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtrange, that when ſo many Laws, that we all know are ſuſpended, the Law of Nature, which is ſo hard to be found out, ſhould be cited; but the Penners of this Declaration had beſt let that Law lie forgotten among the reſt; and there is a ſcurvy Paragraph in it concerning ſelf-Preſervation, that is capable of very unacceptable
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:48501:152"/>Gloſſes. It is hard to tell what Section of the Law of Nature has markt either ſuch a Form of Government, or ſuch a Family for it. And if his Majeſty renounces his Pretenſions to our Allegiance as founded on the Laws of <hi>England;</hi> and betakes himſelf to this Law of Nature, he will perhaps find the Counſel was a little too raſh; but to make the moſt that can be, the Law of Nations or Nature does indeed allow the Governours of all Societies a Power to ſerve themſelves of every Member of it in the caſes of Extream Danger; but no Law of Nature that has been yet heard of will conclude, that if by ſpecial Laws, a ſort of men have been diſabled from all Imployments, that a Prince who at his Coronation Swore to maintain thoſe Laws, may at his pleaſure extinguiſh all theſe Diſabilities.</p>
            <p n="10">X. At the end of the Declaration, as in a Poſcript, His Majeſty aſſures his Subjects, that he will maintain them in their Properties, as well in Church and Abbey Lands, as other Lands: but the chief of all their Properties being the ſhare that they have by their Repreſentatives in the <hi>Legiſlative Power;</hi> this Declaration, which breaks thro' that, is no great Evidence that the reſt will be maintained: and to ſpeak plainly, when a Coronation Oath is ſo little remembred, other Promiſes muſt have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned degree of Credit given to them: as for the Abbey Lands, the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from the Church is according to the Principles of that Religion Sacriledge, and that is a mortal Sin, and there can no <hi>Abſolution</hi> be given to any who continue in it: and ſo this Promiſe being an Obligation to maintain men in a mortal Sin, is nul and void of it ſelf: <hi>Church-Lands</hi> are alſo according to the Doctrine of their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſts, ſo immediately God's Right, that the the Pope himſelf is the only Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrator and Diſpencer, but is not the maſter of them; he can indeed make a truck for God, or let them ſo low, that God ſhall be an eaſie Landlord: but he cannot alter God's Property, nor tranſlate the Right that is in him to Sacrilegious Laymen and Hereticks.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. One of the Effects of this Declaration, will be the ſetting on foot a new run of Addreſſes over the Nation: for there is nothing how impudent and baſe ſoever, of which the abject flattery of a ſlaviſh Spirit is not capable. It muſt be confeſt, to the Reproach of the Age, that all thoſe ſtrains of flattery among the <hi>Romans,</hi> that <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſets forth with ſo much juſt ſcorn, are modeſt things, compared to what this Nation has produced within theſe ſeven Years: only if our Flattery has come ſhort of the Refinedneſs of the <hi>Romans,</hi> it has exceeded theirs as much in its loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fulſomeneſs: The late King ſet out a Declaration, in which he gave the moſt ſolemn Aſſurances poſſible of his adhering to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion eſtabliſhed by Law, and of his Reſolution to have frequent Parliaments; upon which the whole Nation fell as it were into Raptures of Joy and Flattery: but though he lived four Years after that, he called no Parliament, notwithſtanding the Law for Triennial Parliaments: and the manner of his Death, and the Papers printed after his Death in his Name, having ſufficiently ſhewed that he was equally ſincere in both thoſe Aſſurances that he gave, as well in that relating to Religion, as in that other relating to frequent Parliaments; yet upon his Death a new ſet of Addreſſes appeared, in which all that Flattery couldinvent was brought forth, in the Commendations of a Prince, to whoſe Memory the greateſt kindneſs can be done, is to forget him, and becauſe his preſent Majeſty upon his coming to the Throne gave ſome very general Promiſe of maintaining the Church of <hi>England,</hi> this was magnified in ſo extravagant a ſtrain, as if it had been a Security greater than any that the Law could give: tho' by the regard that the King has both to it and to the Laws, it appears that he is reſolved to maintain both equally: ſince then the Nation has already made it ſelf ſufficiently ridiculous both to the preſent and to all ſucceeding Ages; it is time that at laſt men ſhould grow weary, and become aſhamed of their Folly.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. The <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> are now invited to ſet an Example to the reſt: and they who have valued themſelves hitherto upon their Oppoſition to Popery, and that have quarrelled with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for ſome ſmall Approaches to it, in a few Ceremonies, are now ſolicited to rejoyce, becauſe the Laws that ſecure us againſt it, are all plucked up: ſince they enjoy at preſent and during pleaſure leave to meet together. It is natural for all men to love to be ſet at eaſe, eſpecially in the matter of their Conſciences; but it is viſible, that thoſe who allow them this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, do it with no other deſign, but that under a pretence of a General Toleration, they may Introduce a Religion which muſt perſecute all equally: It is likewiſe appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent how much they are hated, and how much they have been perſecuted by the Inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe who now Court them, and who have now no game that is more promiſing,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:48501:152"/>than the engaging them and the Church of <hi>England</hi> into new Quarrels: and as for the Promiſes now made to them, it cannot be ſuppoſed that they will be more laſting than thoſe that were made ſome time ago to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who had both a better Title in Law, and greater Merit upon the Crown to aſſure them that they ſhould be well uſed than theſe can pretend to. The Nation has ſcarce forgiven ſome of the Church of <hi>England</hi> the Perſecution into which they have ſuffered themſelves to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened; tho' now that they ſee Popery barefaced, the Stand that they have made, and the vigorous Oppoſition that they have given to it, is that which makes all men willing to forget what is paſt, and raiſes again the Glory of a Church that was not a little ſtained by the Indiſcretion and Weakneſs of thoſe, that were too apt to believe and hope, and ſo ſuffered themſelves to be made a Property to thoſe who would make them a Sacrifice. The Sufferings of the <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> and the Fury that the Popiſh party expreſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, had recommended them ſo much to the Compaſſions of the Nation, and had given them ſo juſt a pretenſion to favour in a better time, that it will look like a Curſe of God upon them, if a few men, whom the Court has gained to betray them, can have ſuch an ill Influence upon them as to make them throw away all that Merit, and thoſe Compaſſions which their Sufferings have procured them; and to go and court thoſe who are only ſeemingly kind to them, that they may deſtroy both them and us. They muſt remember that as the Church of <hi>England</hi> is the only Eſtabliſhment that our Religion has by Law; ſo it is the main body of the Nation, and all the Sects are but ſmall and ſtragling parties: and if the Legal Settlement of the Church is diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and that body is once broken, theſe leſſer bodies will be all at Mercy: and it is an eaſie thing to define what the Mercies of thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. But tho' it muſt be confeſſed, that the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> are ſtill under ſome Temptations, to receive every thing that gives them preſent eaſe, with a little too much kindneſs; ſince they lie expoſed to many ſevere Laws, for which they have of late felt the weight very heavily, and as they are men, and ſome of them as ill Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured men as other people, ſo it is no wonder if upon the firſt ſurpriſes of the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, they are a little delighted to ſee the Church of <hi>England,</hi> after all its Services and Submiſſions to the Court, ſo much mortified by it; ſo that taking all together it will not be ſtrange if they commit ſome Follies upon this occaſion. Yet on the other hand it paſſes all imagination, to ſee ſome of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially thoſe whoſe Natures we know are ſo particularly ſharpned in the point of Perſecution, chiefly when it is levelled againſt the Diſſenters, rejoice at this Declaration, and make Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes upon it. It it hard to think that they have attained to ſo high a pitch of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Charity, as to thank thoſe who do now <hi>Deſpitefully uſe them,</hi> and that as an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt that within a little while they will <hi>Perſecute</hi> them. This will be an Original, and a Maſter-piece in Flattery, which muſt needs draw the laſt degrees of Contempt on ſuch as are capable of ſo abject and ſordid a Compliance, and that not only from all the true Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but likewiſe from thoſe of the Church <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf; for every man is apt to eſteem an Enemy that is brave even in his Misfortunes, as much as he deſpiſes thoſe whoſe minds ſink with their Condition, for what is it that theſe men would Addreſs the King? Is it becauſe he breaks thoſe Laws that are made in their Favour, and for their Protection: and is now ſtriking at the Root of all Legal Settlement that they have for their Religion? Or is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that at the ſame time that the King profeſſes a Religion that condemns his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, yet he is not contented with the Exerciſe of it as it is warranted by Law, but carries it ſo far as to erect a Court contrary to the expreſs words of a Law ſo lately made: That Court takes care to maintain a due proportion between their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and all their Procedings, that ſo all may be of a piece, and all equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law. They have ſuſpended one Biſhop, only becauſe he would not do that which was not in his power to do: for ſince there is no Extrajudiciary Authority in <hi>England,</hi> a Biſhop can no more proceed to the Sentence of Suſpenſion againſt a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man without a Tryal, and the hearing of Parties, than a Judge can give a Sentence in his Chamber without an Indictment, a Tryal, or a Jury, and becauſe one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt bodies of <hi>England</hi> would not break their Oaths, and obey a <hi>Mandate</hi> that plainly contradicted them, we ſee to what a pitch this is like to be caried. I will not antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate upon this illegal Court, to tell what Judgments are coming; but without carrying our Jealouſies too far, one may ſafely conclude, that they will never depart ſo far from their firſt Inſtitution, as to have any regard, either to our Religion, or our Laws, or Liberties, in any thing they do. If all this were acted by avowed Papiſts, as we are ſure it is projected by ſuch, there were nothing extraordinary in it: but that which carries our Indignation a little too far to be eaſily governed, is to ſee ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Proteſtants, and a few Biſhops, among thoſe that are the fatal Inſtruments of
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:48501:153"/>pulling down the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that thoſe Mercenaries Sacrifice their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and their Church to their Ambition and Intereſts; this has ſuch peculiar Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of Misfortune upon it, that it ſeems it is not enough if we periſh without pity, ſince we fall by that hand that we have ſo much ſupported and fortified, but we muſt become the Scorn of all the World, ſince we have produced ſuch an unnatural Brood, that even while they are pretending to be the Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Mothers Throat: and not content with <hi>Judas</hi>'s Crime, of ſaying, <hi>Hail Maſter,</hi> and <hi>kiſſing</hi> him, while they are betraying him into the hands of others; theſe carry their Wickedneſs farther, and ſay, <hi>Hail Mother,</hi> and then they themſelves murther her. If after all this we are called to bear this as Chriſtians, and to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it as Subjects, if we were required in Patience to poſſeſs our own Souls, and to be in Charity with our Enemies; and which is more, to forgive our Falſe Brethren who add Treachery to their Hatred; the Exhortation were ſeaſonable, and indeed a little neceſſary: for Humane Nature cannot eaſily take down things of ſuch a hard digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but to tell us that we muſt make Addreſſes, and offer Thanks for all this, is to inſult a little too much upon us in our Sufferings: and he that can believe that a dry and cautiouſly worded Promiſe of maintaining the Church of <hi>England,</hi> will be religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly obſerved after all that we have ſeen, and is upon that carried ſo far out of his Wits as to Addreſs and give Thanks, and will believe ſtill, ſuch a man has nothing to excuſe him from believing Tranſubſtantiation it ſelf; for it is plain that he can bring himſelf to believe even when the thing is contrary to the cleareſt Evidence that his Senſes can give him.</p>

            <p>SInce Addreſſes are in faſhion, give me leave to make one to you. This is neither the Effect of Fear, Intereſt, or Reſentment; therefore you may be ſure it is ſincere: and for that reaſon it may expect to be kindly received. Whether it will have power enough to Convince, dependeth upon the Reaſons, of which you are to judge; and upon your preparation of Mind, to be perſwaded by Truth, whenever it appeareth to you. It ought not to be the leſs welcome, for coming from a friendly hand, one whoſe kindneſs to you is not leſſened by difference of Opinion, and who will not let his thoughts for the Publick be ſo tyed or confined to this or that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſion of Proteſtants, as to ſtifle the Charity, which beſides all other Arguments, is at this time become neceſſary to preſerve us.</p>
            <pb n="295" facs="tcp:48501:153"/>
            <p>I am neither ſurprized nor provoked, to ſee that in the Condition you were put into by the Laws, and the ill Circumſtances you lay under, by having the Excluſion and Rebellion laid to your Charge, you were deſirous to make your ſerves leſs uneaſie and obnoxious to Authority. Men who are fore, run to the neareſt Remedy with too much haſte, to conſider all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences: Grains of allowance are to be given, where Nature giveth ſuch ſtrong Influences. When to Men under Sufferings it offereth Eaſe, the preſent Pain will hardly allow time to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the Remedies; and the ſtrongeſt Reaſons can hardly gain a fair Audience from our Mind, whilſt ſo poſſeſſed, till the ſmart is a little allayed.</p>
            <p>I do not know whether the Warmth that naturally belongeth to new Friendſhips, may not make it a harder Task for me to perſwade you. It is like telling Lovers in the beginning of their Joys, that they will in a little time have an end. Such an unwelcome Style doth not eaſily find Credit: but I will ſuppoſe you are not ſo far gone in your new Paſſion, but that you will hear ſtill; and therefore I am under the leſs Diſcouragement, when I offer to your Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion two things. The <hi>firſt</hi> is, the Cauſe you have to ſuſpect your new Friends. The <hi>ſecond,</hi> the Duty incumbent upon you, in Chriſtianity and Prudence, not to hazard the Publick Safety, neither by deſire of Eaſe nor of Revenge.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>Firſt,</hi> Conſider that notwithſtanding the ſmooth Language which is now put on to engage you, theſe new Friends did not make you their Choice, but their Refuge: They have ever made their firſt Courtſhips to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and when they were rejected there, they made their Application to you in the ſecond Place. The Inſtances of this, might be given in all times. I do not repeat them, becauſe whatſoever is unneceſſary, muſt be tedious, the Truth of this Aſſertion being ſo plain, as not to admit a Diſpute. You cannot therefore reaſonably flatter your ſelves, that there is any Inclination to you. They never pretended to allow you any Quarter, but to uſher in Liberty for themſelves under that Shelter. I refer you to Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s <hi>Letters,</hi> and to the <hi>Journals</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> where you may be convinced, if you can be ſo miſtaken, as to doubt; nay, at this very Hour, they can hardly forbear, in the height of their Courtſhip, to let fall hard Words of you. So little is Nature to be reſtrained; it will ſtart out ſometimes, diſdaining to ſubmit to the Uſurpation of Art and Intereſt.</p>
            <p>This Alliance, between <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Infallibility,</hi> is bringing together the Two moſt contrary Things that are in the World. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not only diſlike the allowing Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but by its Principles it cannot do it. Wine is not more expreſly forbidden to the <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> than giving Hereticks Liberty is to <hi>Papiſts:</hi> They are no more able to make good their Vows to you, then Men married before, and their Wife alive, can confirm their Contract with another. The continuance of their Kindneſs would be a Habit of Sin, of which they are to repent, and their Abſolution is to be had upon no other Terms, than their Promiſes to deſtroy you. You are therefore to be hugg'd now, only that you may be the better ſqueez'd at another time. There muſt be ſomething extraordinary, when the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſetteth up Bills, and offereth Plaiſters for tender Conſciences: By all that hath hitherto appeared, her Skill in Chyrurgery lyeth chiefly in a quick Hand, to cut of Limbs; but ſhe is the worſt at Healing, of any that ever pretended to it.</p>
            <p>To come ſo quick from another Extream, is ſuch an unnatural Motion, that you ought to be upon your Guard; the other Day you were <hi>Sons of Belial,</hi> Now, you are <hi>Angels of Light.</hi> This is a violent Change, and it will be fit for you to pauſe upon it, before you believe it: If your Features are not altered, neither is their Opinion of you, whatever may be pretended. Do you believe leſs than you did, that there is Idolatry in the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> ſure you do not. See then, how they treat both in Words and Writing, thoſe who entertain that Opinion. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from hence, how inconſiſtent their Favour is with this ſingle Article, except they give you a Diſpenſation for this too, and by a <hi>Non Obſtante,</hi> ſecure you that they will not think the worſe of you.</p>
            <p>Think a little how dangerous it is to build upon a Foundation of Paradoxes. Popery now is the only Friend to Liberty, and the known Enemy to Perſecution: The Men of <hi>Taunton</hi> and <hi>Tiverton,</hi> are above all other eminent for Loyalty. The <hi>Quakers,</hi> from being declared by the Papiſts not to be Chriſtians, are now made Favorites, and taken into their particular Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they are on a ſudden grown the moſt accompliſhed Men of the Kingdom, in good Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and giving Thanks with the beſt Grace, in double refined Language. So that I ſhould not wonder, though a Man of that Perſwaſion, in ſpight of his Hat, ſhould be Maſter of the Ceremonies. Not to ſay harſher Words, theſe are ſuch very new things, that it is impoſſible not to ſuſpend our Belier, till by a little more Experience we may be informed whether they are Reallities or Apparitions: We have been under ſhameful Miſtakes, if theſe Opinions are true; but for the preſent, we are apt to be incredulous; except we could be convinced, that the Prieſts Words in this Caſe too, are able to make ſuch a ſudden, and effectual Change; and that their Power is not limited to the Sacrament, but that it extendeth to alter the Nature of all other things, as often as they are ſo diſpoſed.</p>
            <pb n="296" facs="tcp:48501:154"/>
            <p>Let me now ſpeak of the Inſtruments of your Friendſhip, and then leave you to judge, whether they do not afford Matter of Suſpition. No Sharpneſs is to be mingled where Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only is intended; ſo nothing will be ſaid to expoſe particular Men, how ſtrong ſoever the Temptation may be, or how clear the Proofs to make it out. A word or two in general, for your better Caution, ſhall ſuffice: Suppoſe then, for Arguments ſake, that the Mediators of this new Alliance, ſhould be ſuch as have been formerly imployed in Treaties of the ſame kind, and there detected to have Acted by Order, and to have been impowered to give Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Rewards. VVould not this be an Argument to ſuſpect them?</p>
            <p>If they ſhould plainly be under Engagements on the one ſide, their Arguments to the other, ought to be received accordingly; their fair Pretences are to be looked upon as part of their Commiſſion, which may not improbably give them a Diſpenſation in the Caſe of Truth, when it may bring a Prejudice upon the Service of thoſe by whom they are imployed.</p>
            <p>If there ſhould be Men, who having formerly had Means and Authority to perſwade by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Arguments, have, in purſuance of that Power, ſprinkled Money amongſt the Diſſenting Miniſters; and if thoſe very Men ſhould now have the ſame Authority, practice the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, and Disburſe, where they cannot otherwiſe perſwade: It ſeemeth to me to be rather an Evidence, than a Preſumption of the Deceit.</p>
            <p>If there ſhould be Miniſters among you, who, by having fallen under Temptations of this kind, are in ſome ſort engaged to continue their Frailty, by the Awe they are in, leſt it ſhould be expoſed: The Perſwaſions of theſe unfortunate Men muſt ſure have the leſs Force, and their Arguments, though never ſo ſpecious, are to be ſuſpected, when they come from Men who have mortgaged themſelves to ſevere Creditors, that expect a rigorous Obſervation of the Contract, let it be never ſo unwarrantable.</p>
            <p>If theſe, or any others, ſhould at this time preach up Anger and Vengeance againſt the Church of <hi>England;</hi> may it not without Injuſtice be ſuſpected, that a thing ſo plainly out of ſeaſon, ſpringeth rather from Corruption than Miſtake; and that thoſe who act this cholerick Part, do not believe themſelves, but only purſue higher Directions, endeavour to make good that part of their Contract which obligeth them, upon a Forfeiture, to make uſe of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming Eloquence? They might apprehend their VVages would be retrenched if they ſhould be moderate: And therefore whilſt Violence is their Intereſt, thoſe who have not the ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, have no reaſon to follow ſuch a partial Example.</p>
            <p>If there ſhould be Men, who by the Load of their Crimes againſt the Government, have been bowed down to comply with it againſt their Conſcience; who by incurring the want of a Pardon, have drawn upon themſelves the Neceſſity of an intire Reſignation: Such Men are to be lamented, but not to be believed. Nay, they themſelves, when they have diſchared their Unwelcome Task, will be inwardly glad that their forced Endeavours do not ſucceed, and are pleaſed when Men reſiſt their Inſinuations; which are far from being voluntary or ſincere, but are ſqueezed out of them by the weight of their being ſo obnoxious.</p>
            <p>If in the height of this great Dearneſs by comparing things, it ſhould happen, that at this Inſtant, there is much a ſurer Friendſhip with thoſe who are ſo far from allowing Liberty, that they allow no Living to a Proteſtant under them. Let the Scene lye in what part of the VVorld it will, the Argument will come home, and ſure it will afford ſufficient Ground to ſuſpect. Apparent Contradictions muſt ſtrike us; neither Nature nor Reaſon can digeſt them: Self-flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and the Deſire to deceive our ſelves, to gratifie a preſent Appetite, with all their Power, which is Great, cannot get the better of ſuch broad Conviction, as ſome things carry along with them. Will you call theſe vain and empty Suſpicions? have you been at all times ſo void of Fears and Jealouſies, as to juſtifie your being ſo unreaſonably Valiant in having none upon this Occaſion? Such an extraordinary Courage at this unſeaſonable time, to ſay no more, is too dangerous a Vertue to be commended.</p>
            <p>If then for theſe and a thouſand other Reaſons, there is cauſe to ſuſpect, ſure your new Friends are not to dictate to you, or adviſe you; for inſtance, the Addreſſes that fly abroad every Week; and Murther us with <hi>another to the ſame;</hi> the firſt Draughts are made by thoſe who are not very proper to be Secretaries to the Proteſtant Religion; and it is your Part only to write them out fairer again. Strange! that you who have been formerly ſo much againſt <hi>Set Forms,</hi> ſhould now be content the Prieſts ſhould Indite for you. The Nature of Thanks is an unavoidable Conſequence of being Pleaſed or Obliged; they grow in the Heart, and from thence ſhew themſelves either in Looks, Speeches, Writing, or Action: No Man was ever Thankful, becauſe he was bid to be ſo, but becauſe he had, or thought he had ſome Reaſon for it. If then there is cauſe in this Caſe to pay ſuch extravagant Acknowledgments, they will flow naturally, without taking ſuch pains to procure them, and it is unkindly done to tire all the Poſt-Horſes with Carrying Circular Letters to ſollicit that which would be done without any Trouble or Conſtraint: If it is really in it ſelf ſuch a Favour, what needeth ſo much preſſing Men to be Thankful, and with ſuch eager Circumſtances, that where Perſwaſions cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude, Threatnings are employed to fright them into a Compliance? Thanks muſt be voluntary,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:48501:154"/>not only unconſtrained, but unſolicited, elſe they are either Trifles or Snares, they either ſignifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or a great deal more than is intended by thoſe that give them. If an inference ſhould be made, that whoſoever thanketh the King for his Declaration, is by that engaged to juſtifie it in point of Law; it is a greater ſtride than, I preſume, all thoſe care to make who are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to Addreſs: If it ſhall be ſuppoſod, that all the Thankers will be Repealers of the <hi>TEST,</hi> when ever a <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhall Meet. Such an Expectation is better prevented before, than diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed afterwards; and the ſureſt way to avoid the lying under ſuch a ſcandal, is not to do any thing that may give a colour to the Miſtake: Theſe Beſpoken Thanks are little leſs impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per than Love Letters that were ſolicited by the Lady to whom they are to be Directed: So, that beſides the little ground there is to give them, the manner of getting them, doth extreamly leſſen their Value. It might be wiſhed that you would have ſuppreſſed your impatience, and have been content for the ſake of Religion, to enjoy it within your ſelves, without the Liberty of a publick Exerciſe, till a Parliament had allowed it: but ſince that could not be, and that the Artificers of ſome amongſt you have made uſe of the Well-meant Zeal of the Generality to draw them into this Miſtake; I am ſo far from blaming you with that ſharpneſs which, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, the Matter in ſtrictneſs would bear, that I am ready to err on the ſide of the more gentle conſtruction.</p>
            <p>There is a great difference between enjoying quietly the advantages of an Act irregularly done by others, and the going about to ſupport it againſt the Laws in being: The Law is ſo Sacred, that no Treſpaſs againſt it is to be Defended; yet Frailties may in ſome meaſure be Excuſed, when they cannot be juſtified. The deſire of enjoying a Liberty from which men have been ſo long reſtrained, may be a Temptation that their Reaſon is not at all times able to reſiſt. If in ſuch a caſe, ſome Objections are leapt over, indifferent men will be more inclined to lament the Occaſion, than to fall too hard upon the Fault, whilſt it is covered with the Apology of a good intention; but where to reſcue your ſelves from the ſeverity of one Law, you give a blow to all the Laws, by which your Religion and Liberty are to be protected; and inſtead of ſilently receiving the benefit of this Indulgence, you ſet up for Advocates to ſupport it, you become voluntary Aggreſſors, and look like Counſel retained by the Prerogative againſt your old Friend <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> who hath done nothing to deſerve her falling thus under your Diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>If the caſe then ſhould be, that the Price expected from you for this Liberty, is giving up your Right in the Laws, ſure you will think twice, before you go any further in ſuch a loſing Bargain. After giving Thanks for the breach of one Law, you loſe the Right of Complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the breach of all the reſt; you will not very well know how to defend your ſelves, when you are preſſed; and having given up the Queſtion, when it was for your advantage, you cannot recall it, when it ſhall be to your Prejudice. If you will ſet up at one time a Power to help you, which at another time by Parity of Reaſon ſhall be made uſe of to deſtroy you, you will neither be pitied, nor relieved againſt a Miſchief you draw upon your ſelves, by being ſo unreaſonably thankful. It is like calling in Auxiliaries to help, who are ſtrong enough to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due you: In ſuch a caſe your Complaints will come too late to be heard, and your ſufferings will raiſe Mirth inſtead of Compaſſion.</p>
            <p>If you think, for your excuſe, to expound your thanks ſo as to reſtrain them to this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular caſe, others, for their ends, will extend them further; and in theſe differing Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that which is back'd by Authority will be the moſt likely to prevail; eſpecially when by the advantage you have given them, they have in truth the better of the Argument, and that the Inferences from your own Conceſſions are very ſtrong, and expreſs againſt you. This is ſo far from being a groundleſs Suppoſition, that there was a late inſtance of it, the laſt Seſſion of Parliament, in the Houſe of Lords, where the firſt Thanks, though things of courſe, were laterpreted to be the Approbation of the King's whole Speech, and a Reſtraint from the further Examination of any part of it, though never ſo much diſliked; and it was with difficulty ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, not to be excluded from the Liberty of objecting to this mighty Prerogative of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing, meerly by this innocent and uſual piece of good Manners, by which no ſuch thing could poſſibly be intended.</p>
            <p>This ſheweth, that ſome bounds are to be put to your good Breeding, and that the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of <hi>England</hi> is too valuable a thing to be ventured upon a Complement. Now that you have for ſome time enjoyed the benefit of the End, it is time for you to look into the Danger of the Means: The ſame Reaſon that made you deſirous to get Liberty, muſt make you ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us to preſerve it: ſo that the next thought will naturally be, not to engage your ſelf beyond Retreat, and to agree ſo far with the Principles of all Religions, as not to rely upon a Death bed Repentance.</p>
            <p>There are certain Periods of time, which being once paſt, make all cautions ineffectual, and all Remedies deſperate. Our Underſtandings are apt to be hurried on by the firſt heats; which if not reſtrained in time, do not give us leave to look back, till it is too late. Conſider this in the Caſe of your A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ger againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and take warning by their Miſtake in the ſame kind, when after the late King's Reſtauration, they preſerved ſo long the bitter taſte
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:48501:155"/>of your rough uſage to them in other times, that it made them forget their Intereſt, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it to their Revenge.</p>
            <p>Either you will blame this Proceeding in them, and for that reaſon not follow it, or if you allow it, you have no reaſon to be offended with them; ſo that you muſt either diſmiſs your Anger, or loſe your Excuſe; except you ſhould argue more partially than will be ſuppoſed of Men of your Morality and Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>If you had now to do with thoſe Rigid Prelates, who made it a Matter of Conſcience to give you the leaſt Indulgence; but kept you at an uncharitable diſtance, and even to your more reaſonable Scruples continued ſtiff and exorable, the Argument might be fairer on your ſide, but ſince the common Danger hath ſo laid open that Miſtake, that all the former Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs towards you is for ever extinguiſh'd, and that it hath turned the Spirit of Perſecution, into a Spirit of Peace, Charity and Condeſcention; ſhall this happy Change only affect the Church of <hi>England?</hi> And are you ſo in Love with ſeperation, as not to be moved by this Example? It ought to be followed, were there no other reaſon than that it is a Vertue; but when beſides that, it is become neceſſary to your preſervation, it is impoſſible to fail the having its Effect upon you.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be ſaid, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is never Humble, but when ſhe is out of Power, and therefore loſeth the Right of being believed when ſhe pretendeth to it; the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, <hi>First,</hi> it would be an uncharitable Objection, and very much miſs-timed? an unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Triumph, not only ungenerous, but unſafe: So that in theſe reſpects it cannot be urged without ſcandal, even though it could be ſaid with Truth. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This is not ſo in Fact, and the Argument muſt fall, being built upon a Falſe Foundation; for whatever may be told you, at this very hour, and in the heat and glare of your preſent ſun-ſhine, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> can in a moment bring Clouds again; and turn the Royal Thunder upon your Heads, blow you off the Stage with a Breath, if ſhe would give but a ſmile or a kind Word; the leaſt Glimpſe of her Complyance, would throw you back into the ſtate of Suffering, and draw up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you all the Atrears of ſeverity, which have accrued during the time of this kindneſs to you, and yet the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> with all her Faults, will not allow her ſelf to be reſcued by ſuch unjuſtifiable means, but chuſeth to bear the weight of Power, rather than lie under the burthen of being Criminal.</p>
            <p>It cannot be ſaid, that ſhe is unprovoked; Books and Letters come out every day, to call for Anſwers, yet ſhe will not be ſtirred. From the ſuppoſed Authors and the Stile one would ſwear they were Undertakers, and had made a Contract to fall out with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> There are Laſhes in every Addreſs, Challenges to draw the Pen in every Pamphlet; in ſhort, the faireſt occaſions in the World given to quarrel; but ſhe wiſely diſtinguiſheth between the Body of Diſſenters, whom ſhe will ſuppoſe to Act, as they do, with no ill intent; and theſe ſmall Skirmiſhers pickt and ſent out to Pickqueer, and to begin a Fray amongſt the Proteſtants, for the entertainment, as well as the advantage of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Conduct is ſo good, that it will be ſcandalous not to Applaud it. It is not equal deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to blame our Adverſaries for doing ill, and not commend them when they do well.</p>
            <p>To hate them becauſe they Perſecuted, and not to be reconciled to them when they are ready to ſuffer, rather than receive all the Advantages that can be gained by a Criminal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance, is a Principle no ſort of Chriſtians can own, ſince it would give an Objection to them never to be Anſwered.</p>
            <p>Think a little, who they were that promoted your former Perſecutions, and then conſider how it will look to be angry with the Inſtruments, and at the ſame time to make a League with the Authors of your ſufferings.</p>
            <p>Have you enough conſidered what will be expected from you? Are you ready to ſtand in every Borough by a Vertue of a <hi>Conge d'eſtire,</hi> and inſtead of Election, be ſatisfied if you are returned?</p>
            <p>Will you in <hi>Parliament,</hi> juſtifie the Diſpenſing Power, with all its conſequences, and repeal the <hi>Teſt,</hi> by which you will make way for the repeal of all the Laws, that were made to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your Religion, and to Enact others that ſhall deſtroy it?</p>
            <p>Are you diſpoſed to change the Liberty of Debate, into the Merit of Obedience, and to be made Inſtruments to Repeal or Enact Laws, when the <hi>Roman Conſiſtory</hi> are <hi>Lords of the Articles?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are you ſo linked with your new Friends, as to reject any Indulgence a <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you, if it ſhall not be ſo Comprehenſive as to include the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in it?</p>
            <p>Conſider that the implyed Conditions of your new Treaty are no leſs, than that you are to do every thing you are deſired, without examining, and that for this pretended Liberty of Conſcience, your real Freedom is to be Sacrificed: Your former Faults hang like Chains ſtill about you, you are let looſe only upon Bayl; the firſt Act of Non-complyance, ſendeth you to jaybagain.</p>
            <p>You may ſee that the Papiſts themſelves, do not rely upon the Legality of this power, which you are to Juſtifie, ſince they being ſo very earneſt to get it Eſtabliſhed by a Law, and
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:48501:155"/>the doing ſuch very hard things in order, as they think to obtain it, is a clear Evidence, that they do not think, that the ſingle Power of the Crown is in this Caſe a good Foundation; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when this is done under a Prince, ſo very tender of all the Rights of Soveraignty, that he would think it a diminution to his Prerogative, where he conceiveth it ſtrong enough to go alone, to call in the Legiſlative help to ſtrengthen and ſupport it.</p>
            <p>You have formerly blamed the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and not without reaſon, for going ſo far as they did in their Compliance; and yet as ſoon as they ſtopped, you ſee they are not only Deſerted, but Proſecuted: Conclude then from this Example, that you muſt either break off your Friendſhip, or reſolve to have no Bounds in it. If they do not ſucceed in their Deſign, they will leave you firſt; if they do, you muſt either leave them, when it will be too late for your Safety, or elſe after the ſqueazineſs of ſtarting at a Surplice, you muſt be forced to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
            <p>Remember that the other day thoſe of the Church of <hi>England</hi> were <hi>Trimmers</hi> for enduring you, and now by a ſudden Turn, you are become the Favourites; do not deceive your ſelves, it is not the Nature of laſting Plants thus to ſhoot up in a Night; you may look gay and green for a little time, but you want a Root to give you a continuance. It is not ſo long ſince, as to be forgotten, that the <hi>Maxim</hi> was, <hi>It is impoſſible for a Diſſenter, not to be a REBEL.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider at this time in <hi>France,</hi> even the new Converts are ſo far from being Imployed, that they are Diſarmed: Their ſudden Change maketh them ſtill to be diſtruſted, notwithſtanding that they are Reconciled: What are you to expect then from your dear Friends, to whom, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſhall think fit to throw you off again, you have in other times given ſuch Arguments for their excuſe?</p>
            <p>Beſides all this, you Act very unskilfully againſt your viſible Intereſt, if you throw away the Advantages, of which you can hardly fail in the next probable Revolution. Things tend naturally to what you would have, if you would let them alone, and not by an unſeaſonable Activity loſe the Influences of your good Star, which promiſeth you every thing that is proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> convinced of its Errour in being ſevere to you; the <hi>Parliament,</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it meeteth, ſure to be Gentle to you; the next Heir bred in the Country which you have ſo often Quoted for a Pattern of Indulgence; a general Agreement of all thinking Men, that we muſt no more cut our ſelves off from the Proteſtants abroad, but rather inlarge the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations upon which we are to build our Defences againſt the Common Enemy; ſo that in Truth, all things ſeem to conſpire to give you eaſe and ſatisfaction, if by too much haſte to anticipate your good Fortune, you do not deſtroy it.</p>
            <p>The Proteſtants have but one Article of Human Strength, to oppoſe the Power which is now againſt them, and that is, not to loſe the advantage of their Numbers, by being ſo unwary as to let themſelves be divided.</p>
            <p>We all agree in our Duty to our Prince, our Objections to his Belief, do not hinder us from ſeeing his Vertues; and our not complying with his Religion, hath no effect upon our Allegiance; we are not to be Laughed out of our Paſſive Obedience, and the Doctrine of Non-Reſiſtance, though even thoſe who perhaps owe the beſt part of their Security to that Principle, are apt to make a Jeſt of it.</p>
            <p>So that if we give no advantage by the fatal Miſtake of miſapplying our Anger, by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural courſe of things, this Danger will paſs away like a ſhower of Hail; fair weather will ſucceed, as lowring as the Sky now looketh, and all by this plain and eaſie Receipt. Let us be ſtill, quiet and undivided, firm at the ſame time to our Religion, our Loyalty, and our Laws, and ſo long as we continue this method, it is next to impoſſible, that the odds of two hundred to one ſhould loſe the Bett; except the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which hath been ſo long barren of Miracles, ſhould now in her declining Age, be brought a Bed of one that would out-do the beſt ſhe can brag of in her <hi>Legend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, the ſhort Queſtion will be, whether you will Joyn with thoſe who muſt in the end run the ſame Fate with you. If Proteſtants of all ſorts, in their Behaviour to one another, have been to blame, they are upon the more equal terms, and for that very Reaſon it is fitter for them now to be reconciled. Our Diſ-union is not only a Reproach, but a Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to us; thoſe who believe in modern Miracles, have more Right, or at leaſt more Excuſe, to neglect all Secular Cautions: but for us, it is as juſtifiable to have no Religion, as wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to throw away the Human Means of preſerving it.

               <hi>The</hi> ANATOMY <hi>of an</hi> EQUIVALENT.</head>
            <p n="1">I. THE World hath of late years never been without ſome extraordinary <hi>Word</hi> to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Coffee-houſes and fill the Pamphlets. Sometimes it is a <hi>new</hi> one invented, and ſometimes an <hi>Old</hi> one revived. They are uſually fitted to ſome preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, with Intentions as differing as the various Deſigns ſeveral <hi>Parties</hi> may have, either to delude the people, or to expoſe their Adverſaries: They are not of long continuance, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have paſſed a little while, and that they are grown Nauſeous by being ſo often repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they give place to ſomething that is newer. Thus, after <hi>Whig, Tory,</hi> and <hi>Trimmer,</hi> have had their Time, now they are dead and forgotten, being ſupplanted by the word <hi>Equivalent,</hi> which reigneth in their ſtead.</p>
            <p>The Birth of it is in ſhort this: After many repeated Eſſays to diſpoſe Men to the Repeal of Oaths and Teſts, made for the ſecurity of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> the general averſion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in it was found to be ſo great, that it was thought adviſeable to try another manner of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting it, and to ſee whether by putting the <hi>ſame thing</hi> into <hi>another Mould,</hi> and ſoftning an <hi>harſh Propoſition</hi> by a <hi>plauſible Term,</hi> they might not have better ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>To this end, inſtead of an <hi>abſolute quitting</hi> of theſe Laws, without any Condition, which was the <hi>firſt</hi> Propoſal; Now it is put into gentler Language, and runneth thus; <hi>If you will take away the</hi> Oaths <hi>and</hi> Teſts, <hi>you ſhall have as good a thing for them.</hi> This put into the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Word, is now called an <hi>Equivalent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. So much to the Word it ſelf. I will now endeavour in ſhort to Examine and Explain, in order to the having it fully underſtood,</p>
            <p>Firſt, What <hi>is</hi> the nature of a true <hi>Equivalent;</hi> and</p>
            <p>In the next place, What things <hi>are not</hi> to be admired under that denomination.</p>
            <p>I ſhall treat theſe as general Propoſitions; and tho I cannot undertake how far they may be <hi>convincing,</hi> I may ſafely do it, that they are <hi>Impartial;</hi> of which there can be no greater evidence than that I make neither Inference, nor Application, but leave that part intirely to the Reader, according as his own Thoughts ſhall direct and diſpoſe him.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I will firſt take notice, that this Word, by the Application which hath been made of it in ſome modern inſtances, lieth under ſome <hi>Diſadvantage,</hi> not to ſay ſome <hi>Scandal.</hi> It is tranſmitted hither from <hi>France;</hi> and if as in moſt other things that we take from them, we carry them beyond the Pattern, it ſhould prove ſo in this, we ſhould get into a more <hi>partial</hi> Sti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e than the Principles of Engliſh Juſtice will I hope ever allow us to be guilty of.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> King's <hi>Equivalents</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> are very <hi>extraordinary Bargains;</hi> his manner of propoſing and obtaining them, is very differing from the uſual methods of <hi>equal</hi> dealing. In a later Inſtance, <hi>Denmark,</hi> by the encouragement as well as by the example of <hi>France,</hi> hath propos'd things to the Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> which are called <hi>Equivalents,</hi> but that they are ſo, the World is not yet ſufficiently convinc'd, and probably the Parties concern'd do not think them to be ſo, and conſequently do not appear to be at all diſpoſed to accept them. Princes enjoyn and preſcribe ſuch things when they have <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> to ſupply the want of <hi>Arguments;</hi> and according to practice in theſe Caſes, the weaker are never thought to have an <hi>ill Bargain,</hi> if they have <hi>any thing</hi> left them. So that the firſt Qualification of an <hi>Equivalent,</hi> muſt be, that the Appraiſers be <hi>indifferent,</hi> elſe it is only a <hi>Sound,</hi> there can be nothing <hi>real</hi> in it: For, where the ſame party that <hi>propoſeth</hi> a Bargain, claimeth a Right to ſet the <hi>Value;</hi> or which is worſe: hath <hi>power</hi> too to make it good; the other may be forced to <hi>ſubmit</hi> to the Conditions, but he can by no means ever be perſwaded to <hi>treat</hi> upon them.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The next thing to be conſidered is, that to make an <hi>Equivalent</hi> in reality an equal thing, in the Propoſer, it muſt be a <hi>better</hi> thing than that which is required by him; <hi>juſt as good</hi> is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Hazard of not being <hi>quite ſo good:</hi> It is not eaſie to have ſuch an even Hand, as to make the Value exactly equal; beſides, according to the Maxim in Law, <hi>Melior conditio poſſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> the Offer is not fair, except the thing offered is better in Value than the Thing demanded. There muſt be Allowance for removing what is fixed, and there muſt be ſomething that may be a Juſtification for <hi>Changing.</hi> The Value of things very often depende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h more upon other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, than upon what is meerly intrinſick to them; therefore the Calculation muſt be made upon that Foot, perhaps in moſt Caſes; and particularly the <hi>Want</hi> which one of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may have of the Thing he requireth, maketh it more valuable to <hi>him</hi> than it is in <hi>it ſelf.</hi> If the Party <hi>propoſing</hi> doth not want the Thing he would have in Exchange, his requiring it is <hi>importinent:</hi> If he doth, his want of it m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt go <hi>into</hi> the Appraiſement, and by conſequence every Propoſer of an <hi>Equivalent</hi> muſt offer a <hi>better</hi> Thing, or elſe he muſt not take it unkindly to be refuſed, except the other Party hath an <hi>equal Want</hi> of the <hi>ſame</hi> Thing, which is very improbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſince naturally he that wanteth moſt, will ſpeak firſt.</p>
            <pb n="301" facs="tcp:48501:156"/>
            <p n="5">V. Another thing neceſſary to the making a fair Bargain is, that let the Parties who treat, be they never ſo unequal in themſelves, yet as to the particular thing propoſed, there muſt be an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Equality,</hi> as far as it relateth to the full Liberty of <hi>Taking</hi> or <hi>Refuſing, Concurring</hi> or <hi>Objecting,</hi> without any conſequence of Revenge, or ſo much as Diſſatisfaction; for it is impoſſible to <hi>treat</hi> where it is an Affront to <hi>differ;</hi> in that Caſe there is no mean between the two Extreams, either an open Quarrel, or an intire Submiſſion; the <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Bargaining</hi> muſt be equal, elſe the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain <hi>it ſelf</hi> cannot be ſo: For Example, the <hi>Propoſer</hi> is not only to uſe <hi>equal</hi> Terms as to the <hi>Matter,</hi> but <hi>fair</hi> ones in the <hi>Manner</hi> too. There muſt be no Intimations of <hi>Anger</hi> in caſe of <hi>Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,</hi> much leſs any open <hi>Threatning.</hi> Such a Stile is ſo ill ſuited to the uſual way of Treating, that it looketh more like a Breach of the <hi>Peace,</hi> than the making a Bargain. It would be yet more improper, and leſs agreeing with the Nature of an <hi>Equivalent,</hi> if, whilſt two Men are a chaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering about the <hi>Price,</hi> one of them ſhould actually <hi>take</hi> the thing in queſtion at his <hi>own Rate,</hi> and afterwards deſire to have his <hi>Poſſeſſion confirmed</hi> by a formal Agreement; ſuch a <hi>Proceeding</hi> would not only <hi>deſtroy</hi> that <hi>Particular Contract,</hi> but make it impoſſible to have any <hi>other,</hi> with the <hi>Party</hi> that could be guilty of ſuch a <hi>Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>Violence</hi> preceding, deſtroyeth all Contracts, and even though the Party that offereth it ſhould have a right to the thing he ſo taketh, yet it is to be obtained by <hi>legal</hi> Means, elſe it may be <hi>forfeited</hi> by his <hi>Irregularity</hi> in the Purſuit of it: The <hi>Law</hi> is ſuch an Enemy to <hi>Violence,</hi> and ſo little to be reconciled to it, that in the Caſe of a <hi>Rape,</hi> the Puniſhment is not taken off, tho the Party injured afterward conſenteth. The Juſtice of the Law hath its Eye upon the firſt Act, and the Maxim of <hi>Volenti non fit injuria,</hi> doth not in this Caſe help the Offender, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Plea <hi>ſubſequent</hi> to the Crime, which maketh it to be rejected as a thing wrong dated, and out of time.</p>
            <p>In taking away Goods or Money it is the ſame thing. The Party Robbed, by giving them afterwards to the Taker, does not exempt him from the Puniſhment of the <hi>Violence:</hi> Quite contrary, the Man from whom they were taken is puniſhable, if he doth not <hi>Proſecute.</hi> If the Caſe ſhould be, that a Man thus taking away a thing without Price, claimeth a Right to take it, then whether it is well or ill founded is not the Queſtion; but ſure, the Party from whom it is ſo taken, whilſt he is treating to <hi>Sell</hi> or <hi>Exchange</hi> it, can never make a Bargain with ſo <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary</hi> a Chapman, there being no Room left after that to talk of the Value.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. To make an equal Bargain there muſt be a Liberty of <hi>differing,</hi> not only in every thing that is <hi>really Eſſential,</hi> but in every thing that is <hi>thought ſo</hi> by <hi>either Party,</hi> and moſt eſpecially by him who is in <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of the thing demanded: His <hi>Opinion</hi> muſt be a <hi>Rule</hi> to him, and even his <hi>Miſtake</hi> in the Value, though it may not convince the Man he hath to deal with, yet he will be juſtified for not accepting what is offered, till that <hi>Miſtake</hi> is fairly rectified and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled.</p>
            <p>When a <hi>Security</hi> is deſired to be <hi>changed,</hi> that Side which <hi>deſireth</hi> it muſt not pretend to <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi> upon the other, ſo as to dictate to them, and tell them without debate, that they are <hi>ſafe</hi> in what is propoſed, ſince of that the Counſel on the <hi>other Side</hi> muſt certainly be the moſt <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judges.</hi> The <hi>Hand</hi> it cometh from is a great Circumſtance, either to invite or diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in all Matters of Contract; the Qualifications of the <hi>Party offering,</hi> muſt ſuit with the <hi>Propoſition</hi> it ſelf, elſe let it be never ſo fair, there is Ground for <hi>Suſpition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">VIII. What Men are of a Temper, that they think they have <hi>Wrong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> done them, if they have not always the <hi>better</hi> ſide of a <hi>Bargain:</hi> If they happen to be ſuch, as by Experience have been found to have an <hi>ill Memory</hi> for their <hi>Word.</hi> If the Character they bear, doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend their <hi>Juſtice,</hi> where-ever their <hi>Intereſt</hi> is concern'd. In theſe Caſes, thinking Men will avoid Dealing, not only to prevent <hi>Surprize,</hi> but to cut off the Occaſions of <hi>Difficulty</hi> or <hi>Diſpute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is yet <hi>more diſcouraging,</hi> when there are, either a <hi>precedent Practice,</hi> or <hi>ſtanding</hi> Maxims of <hi>groſs Partiality,</hi> in aſſuming a Priviledge of <hi>Exemption</hi> from the uſual Methods of <hi>equal</hi> Dealing.</p>
            <p>To illuſtrate this by an Inſtance. Suppoſe that in any Caſe, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould have an <hi>Intereſt</hi> to promote a Bargain; let her <hi>way of Dealing</hi> be a little examin'd, which will direct thoſe with whom ſhe treateth, how far they are to rely upon what <hi>ſhe propoſeth</hi> to them. We may begin with the Quality in the World, the leaſt conſiſting with equal Dealing, <hi>viz.</hi> An incurable <hi>Partiality</hi> to <hi>herſelf;</hi> which, that it may arrive to its full Perfection, is crowned with <hi>Infallibility.</hi> At the firſt ſerting out, ſhe maketh her ſelf uncapable of dealing upon Terms of <hi>Equality,</hi> by the Power ſhe claimeth of <hi>Binding</hi> and <hi>Looſing,</hi> which hath been ſo often applied to <hi>Treaties,</hi> as well as to <hi>Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Definition of <hi>Juſtice</hi> is to deal <hi>equally,</hi> ſhe cannot be guilty of it without <hi>betraying her Prerogative,</hi> and according to her Principles, ſhe giveth up the Superiority derived to her by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Succeſſion,</hi> if ſhe degradeth her ſelf ſo as to be judged by the Rules of <hi>Common Right,</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if the Bargain ſhould be with <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who in her Opinion have <hi>forf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="9">IX. Beſides, her Taſte hath been ſo ſpoiled by <hi>unreaſonable Bargains,</hi> that ſhe can never bring down her Palate to any thing that is <hi>Fair</hi> or <hi>Equal.</hi> She hath not only judg'd it an <hi>Equivalent,</hi> but a <hi>great Bargain</hi> for the other ſide, to give them <hi>Abſolutions</hi> and <hi>Indulgences</hi> for the <hi>real Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of great Sums, for which ſhe hath drawn Bills to have them repayed with Intereſt in <hi>Purgatory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Spiritual Bank</hi> hath carried on ſuch a Trade upon theſe <hi>advantagious Terms,</hi> that it can never ſubmit to the ſmall Profits an <hi>ordinary Bargain</hi> would produce.</p>
            <p>The ſeveral Popes have in Exchange for the <hi>Peter-Pence,</hi> and all their other <hi>Rents</hi> and <hi>Fines</hi> out of <hi>England,</hi> ſent <hi>ſanctified Roſes, Reliques,</hi> and other ſuch Wonder-working Trifles. And by Virtue of their Character of <hi>Holy Fathers,</hi> have uſed Princes like <hi>Children,</hi> by ſending them ſuch <hi>Rattles</hi> to play with, which they made them buy at extravagant Rates; beſides which, they were to be thankful too, into the Bargain.</p>
            <p>A Chip of the Croſs, a Piece of St. <hi>Laurence</hi>'s Grid-iron, a Hair of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> have been thought <hi>Equivalents</hi> for much more <hi>ſubstantial</hi> things. The Popes being Maſters of the Jewel-Houſe, have ſet the <hi>Rates</hi> upon them, and they have paſſed; though the whole Shop would not take up the Value of a Bodkin in <hi>Lombardſtreet</hi> upon the Credit of them.</p>
            <p>They are <hi>unconſcionable Purchaſers,</hi> for they get all the Money from the <hi>Living,</hi> by praying for them when they are <hi>dead.</hi> And it is obſervable, that the Northern Part of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> which beſt underſtandeth <hi>Trade,</hi> were the firſt that <hi>refuſed</hi> to make any more Bargains with them; ſo that it looketh as if the chief Quarrel to the <hi>Hereticks</hi> was not as they were <hi>ill Chriſtians,</hi> but as they were <hi>unkind Merchants;</hi> in ſo diſcourteouſly rejecting the Commodities of the Growth of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude this Head, There is no bartering with <hi>Infallibility,</hi> it being ſo much <hi>above Equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> that it cannot bear the Indignity of a <hi>true Equivalent.</hi>

If whatſoever is more than <hi>ordinary</hi> is <hi>ſuſpitious,</hi> every thing that is unnatural is more ſo: It is not only <hi>unneceſſary</hi> but <hi>unatural</hi> too to <hi>perſwade</hi> with <hi>Violence</hi> what it is <hi>Folly</hi> to refuſe; to <hi>puſh</hi> Men with Eagerneſs into a <hi>good Bargain</hi> for <hi>themſelves,</hi> is a Stile very much unſuitable to the <hi>Nature</hi> of the thing. But it goeth further, and is yet more abſurd, to grow <hi>angry</hi> with Men for not receiving a <hi>Propoſal</hi> that is for their <hi>Advantage;</hi> Men ought to be content with the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity of <hi>offering</hi> good Bargains, and ſhould give their <hi>Compaſſion</hi> to thoſe who do <hi>not underſtand</hi> them: but by carrying their good Nature ſo far as to be <hi>Cholerick</hi> in ſuch a Caſe, they would follow the Example of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> where the Definition of <hi>Charity</hi> is very extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. In her Language, the Writ <hi>de Haeretico Comburendo</hi> is a <hi>Love-Letter,</hi> and <hi>burning</hi> Men for differing with them in Opinion, howſoever miſcalled <hi>Cruelty,</hi> is as they underſtand it, the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> of <hi>flaming Charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Anger</hi> in theſe Caſes laſteth <hi>long,</hi> it is moſt probable that it is for our <hi>own Sakes;</hi> Good Nature for <hi>others</hi> is one of thoſe Diſeaſes that is <hi>cured</hi> by <hi>Time,</hi> and eſpecially where it is <hi>offered</hi> and <hi>rejected;</hi> but for our ſelves it <hi>never faileth,</hi> and cannot be extinguiſhed but with our Life. It is fair if Men can believe that their Friends love them <hi>next</hi> to themſelves, to love them <hi>better</hi> is too much; the Expreſſion is ſo <hi>unnatural,</hi> that it is <hi>cloying,</hi> and Men muſt have no <hi>Senſe,</hi> who in this caſe have no <hi>Suſpition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">XII. Another Circumſtance neceſſary to a <hi>fair Bargain</hi> is, That there muſt be <hi>Openneſs</hi> and <hi>Freedom</hi> allowed, as the Effect of that <hi>Equality</hi> which is the Foundation of Contracting. There muſt be full Liberty of <hi>Objecting,</hi> and making <hi>Doubts</hi> and <hi>Scruples:</hi> If they are ſuch as can be <hi>anſwered,</hi> the <hi>Party</hi> convinced is ſo much the more <hi>confirmed</hi> and <hi>incouraged</hi> to deal, inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hindred by them; but it inſtead of an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to ſatisfie, there is nothing but <hi>Anger</hi> for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, it is impoſſible not to conclude that there is never a good one to give; ſo that the Objection <hi>remaining,</hi> without being fully <hi>confuted,</hi> there is an abſolute <hi>Bar</hi> put to any further Treaty.</p>
            <p>There can be no Dealing where one ſide aſſumeth a Priviledge to <hi>impoſe,</hi> ſo as to make an <hi>Offer</hi> and not bear the <hi>Examination</hi> of it; this is giving <hi>Judgment,</hi> not making a <hi>Bargain.</hi> Where
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:48501:158"/>it is called <hi>unmannerly</hi> to <hi>object,</hi> or <hi>criminal</hi> to <hi>refuſe,</hi> the ſureſt way is for Men to ſtay where they are, rather than treat upon ſuch Diſadvantages.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould happen to be in any Country where the governing Power ſhould allow Men <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> in the Choice of their <hi>Religion,</hi> it would be ſtrange to deny them <hi>Liberty of Speech</hi> in making a <hi>Bargain.</hi> Such a Contradiction would be ſo diſcouraging, that they muſt be <hi>unreaſonably ſanguine,</hi> who in that caſe can entertain the Hopes of a <hi>fair Equivalent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">XIII. An <hi>equal</hi> Bargain muſt not be a <hi>Myſtery</hi> nor a <hi>Secret,</hi> The Purchaſer or Propoſer is to tell <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>plainly,</hi> what it is he intendeth to give in Exchange for that which he requireth. It muſt be <hi>viewed</hi> and <hi>conſidered</hi> by the other <hi>Party,</hi> that he may judge of the Value; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing what it is, he cannot determine whether he ſhall <hi>take</hi> or <hi>leave</hi> it. An Aſſertion in <hi>general,</hi> that it ſhall be <hi>as good,</hi> or a <hi>better</hi> thing, is not in this a <hi>ſufficient</hi> Excuſe for the Miſtake of Dealing upon ſuch uncertain Terms. In all things that are dark, and not enough explained, <hi>Suſpition</hi> naturally followeth: A <hi>Secret</hi> generally implieth a <hi>Defect</hi> or a <hi>Deceit;</hi> and if a <hi>falſe Light</hi> is an Objection, <hi>no Light</hi> at all is yet a greater. To pretend to give a <hi>better</hi> thing, and to refuſe to ſhew it, is very near ſaying, it is <hi>not ſo good</hi> a one; at leaſt ſo it will be taken in common conſtruction. A <hi>Myſtery</hi> is yet a more diſcouraging thing to a <hi>Proteſtant;</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if the Propoſition ſhould come from a <hi>Papiſt;</hi> it being one of his great Objections to that Church, that there are ſo many of them <hi>Inviſible</hi> and <hi>Impoſſible,</hi> which are ſo violently thruſt upon their Underſtandings; that they are overlaid with them. They think that <hi>rational Creatures</hi> are to be convinced only by <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and that <hi>Reaſon</hi> muſt be <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>freely expoſed;</hi> elſe they will think themſelves uſed with <hi>Contempt,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Equality,</hi> and will never allow ſuch a <hi>ſuſpected Secrecy</hi> to be a fit Preface to a <hi>real Equivalent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="14">XIV. In Matters of Contract, not only the preſent Value, but the <hi>Contingenoies</hi> and <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,</hi> as far as they can be fairly ſuppoſed, are to be conſidered. For Example, if there ſhould be a <hi>Poſſibility,</hi> that one of the Parties may be ruined by <hi>Accepting,</hi> and the other only <hi>diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed</hi> by his <hi>Refuſing;</hi> the Conſequences are ſo <hi>extreamly unequal,</hi> that it is not imaginable a Man ſhould take that for an <hi>Equivalent,</hi> which hath ſuch a <hi>fatal Impoſſibility</hi> at the Heels of it.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould happen in a <hi>publick</hi> Caſe, that ſuch a <hi>Propoſal</hi> ſhould come from the <hi>minor Part</hi> of an Aſſembly or Nation, to the <hi>greater;</hi> it is very juſt, that the <hi>Hazard</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Poſſibility</hi> ſhould more or leſs likely fall upon the <hi>leſſer Part,</hi> rather than upon the <hi>greater;</hi> for whoſe Sake and Advantage, things are and muſt be calculated in all <hi>publick Conſtitutions.</hi> Suppoſe in any mixed Government, the <hi>chief Magiſtrate</hi> ſhould propoſe upon a <hi>Condition,</hi> in the <hi>Senate, Diet,</hi> or other <hi>Supreme Aſſembly,</hi> either to Enact or Abrocate one or more Laws, by which a <hi>Poſſibility</hi> might be let in of <hi>deſtroying</hi> their <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Property,</hi> which in other Language ſignifieth no leſs than <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body;</hi> where could be the <hi>Equivalent</hi> in the Caſe, not only for the <hi>real Loſs,</hi> but even for the <hi>Fear</hi> of <hi>loſing</hi> them? Men can fall no lower than to <hi>loſe all,</hi> and if <hi>loſing all</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth them, the <hi>venturing all</hi> muſt fright them.</p>
            <p>In an Inſtance when Men are ſecure, that how far ſoever they may be over run by <hi>Violence,</hi> yet they can never be undone by <hi>Law,</hi> except they give their Aſſiſtance to make it poſſible; tho it ſhould neither be likely, nor intended, ſtill the <hi>Conſequence</hi> which may happen is too big for any preſent thing to make amends for it. Whilſt the Word <hi>Poſſible</hi> remaineth, it muſt <hi>forbid</hi> the Bargain. Where-ever it falleth out therefore, that in an Example of a publick Nature, the Changing, Enacting, or Repealing a Law, <hi>may naturally</hi> tend to the <hi>Miſplacing</hi> the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Power in the Hands of thoſe who have a <hi>ſeparate Intereſt</hi> from the Body of a People, there can be no Treating, till it is demonſtrably made out, that ſuch a Conſequence ſhall be <hi>abſolutely impoſſible:</hi> for if that ſhall be <hi>denied</hi> by thoſe who make the Propoſal, if it is becauſe they <hi>cannot</hi> do it, the Motion at firſt was very <hi>unfair.</hi> If they <hi>can</hi> and <hi>will not,</hi> it would be yet leſs reaſonable to expect that ſuch <hi>partial</hi> Dealers would ever give an <hi>Equivalent</hi> fit to be <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">XV. It is neceſſary in all Dealing to be <hi>aſſured,</hi> in the firſt place, that the <hi>Party propoſing</hi> is in a Condition to <hi>make good</hi> his Offer; that he is neither under any <hi>former Obligations</hi> or <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Claims,</hi> which may render him uncapable of performing it; elſe he is ſo far in the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Minor,</hi> that whatever he diſpoſeth by Sale or Exchange, may be afterwards reſumed, and the Contract become void, being <hi>originally defective,</hi> for want of <hi>ſufficient</hi> legal <hi>Power</hi> in him that made it.</p>
            <p>In the Caſe of a ſtrict Settlement, where the Party is only <hi>Tenant</hi> for <hi>Life,</hi> there is no poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of treating with one under ſuch Fetters; no Purchaſe or Exchange of Lands, or any thing elſe can be good, where there is ſuch an <hi>Incapacity</hi> of making out a Title; the Intereſt veſted in him being ſo <hi>limited,</hi> that he can do little more than pronounce the Words of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, he can by no means perform the <hi>Effect</hi> of it.</p>
            <pb n="304" facs="tcp:48501:159"/>
            <p>In more <hi>publick</hi> Inſtances, the <hi>Impoſſibility</hi> is yet more expreſs; as ſuppoſe in any Kingdom, where the <hi>People</hi> have ſo much Liberty left them, as that they may make Contracts with the <hi>Crown,</hi> there ſhould be ſome <hi>peculiar Rights</hi> claimed to be ſo <hi>fixed</hi> to the Royal Function, that no King for the time being could have Power to <hi>part</hi> with them, being ſo <hi>fundamentally</hi> tied to the Office, that they can never be <hi>ſeparated.</hi> Such <hi>Rights</hi> can upon no occaſion be received in <hi>Exchange</hi> for any thing the Crown may deſire from the People: That can never be <hi>taken</hi> in Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which cannot lawfully be <hi>given,</hi> ſo that if they ſhould part with that which is required upon thoſe Terms, it muſt be a <hi>Gift,</hi> it cannot be a <hi>Bargain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is not in the whole <hi>Dictionary</hi> a more untractable Word than <hi>Inherent,</hi> and leſs to be reconciled to the Word <hi>Equivalent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Party that will contract in ſpight of ſuch a Claim, is content to <hi>take</hi> what is <hi>impoſſible</hi> to <hi>grant,</hi> and if he complaineth of his Diſappointment, he neither <hi>can have</hi> Remedy, nor <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth</hi> it.</p>
            <p>If a Right ſo claimed happeneth to be of ſo <hi>comprehenſive</hi> a <hi>Nature,</hi> as that by a clear Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence it may extend to <hi>every thing elſe,</hi> as well as to the <hi>particular</hi> Matter in queſtion, as often as the Supream Magiſtrate ſhall be ſo diſpoſed, there can in that caſe be no <hi>Treating</hi> with a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative that ſwalloweth all the Right the People can pretend to; and if they have no Right to any thing of which they are poſſeſſed, it is a <hi>Jeſt</hi> and not a <hi>Bargain,</hi> to obſerve any Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in parting with it.</p>
            <p>A Claim may be ſo ſtated, that by the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Advantage</hi> of <hi>Interpreting,</hi> it ſhall have ſuch a murthering Eye, that if it looketh upon a Law, like a <hi>Baſilisk,</hi> it ſhall ſtrike it dead: Where is the Poſſibility of Treating, where <hi>ſuch a Right is aſſumed?</hi> Nay, let it be ſuppoſed, that ſuch a Claim is <hi>not well founded</hi> in <hi>Law,</hi> and that upon a free Diſquiſition it could <hi>not be made out;</hi> yet even in this Caſe, none that are well adviſed, will conclude a Bargain till it is fully <hi>ſtated</hi> and <hi>cleared,</hi> or indeed, ſo much as <hi>engage</hi> in a <hi>Treaty,</hi> till by way of preliminary all <hi>poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> ſhall be <hi>remov'd</hi> of any Trouble or Diſpute.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. There is a collateral Circumſtance in making a Contract, which yet deſerveth to be conſidered, as much as any thing that belongeth to it; and that is the <hi>Character</hi> and <hi>Figure</hi> of the <hi>Parties</hi> contracting; if they treat only by themſelves, and if by others, the <hi>Qualifications</hi> of the <hi>Inſtruments</hi> they employ.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Propoſer</hi> eſpecially, muſt not be ſo <hi>low,</hi> as to want <hi>Credit,</hi> or ſo raiſed, as to carry him <hi>above</hi> the Reach of <hi>ordinary Dealing.</hi> In the firſt, There is <hi>Scandal,</hi> in the other, <hi>Danger.</hi> There is no Rule without ſome Exception, but generally ſpeaking, the <hi>Means</hi> ſhould be ſuited to the <hi>End;</hi> and ſince all Men who treat, pretend an <hi>equal Bargain,</hi> it is deſirable that there may be <hi>Equality</hi> in the <hi>Perſons,</hi> as well as in the <hi>Thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Manner</hi> of doing things hath ſuch an Influence upon the <hi>Matter,</hi> that Men may gueſs at the <hi>End</hi> by the <hi>Inſtruments</hi> that are uſed to obtain it, who are a very good <hi>Direction</hi> how far to rely upon, or ſuſpect the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of that which is propoſed. An Abſurdity in the way of <hi>carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on</hi> a Treaty in any <hi>one</hi> Circumſtance, if it is very groſs, is enough to perſwade a thinking Man to break off, and take warning from ſuch an <hi>ill Appearance.</hi> Some things are ſo glaring, that it is impoſſible to ſee, and conſequently not to <hi>ſuſpect</hi> them; as ſuppoſe in a private Caſe there ſhould be a Treaty of <hi>Marriage</hi> between two Honorable Families, and the propoſing ſide ſhould think fit to ſend a <hi>Woman</hi> that had been <hi>Carted</hi> to perſwade the <hi>young Lady</hi> to an Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and Conſent; the unfitneſs of the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> muſt naturally diſpoſe the other Party to <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt</hi> the <hi>Meſſage,</hi> and to reſiſt the Temptation of the <hi>beſt Match</hi> that could be offered, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by that <hi>Hand,</hi> and uſhered in by ſuch a <hi>doſcouraging Preluminary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a <hi>publick</hi> Inſtance, the Suſpicion ariſing from <hi>unfit Mediators,</hi> ſtill groweth more reaſonable in Proportion as the <hi>Conſequence</hi> is much <hi>greater</hi> of being deceived. If a <hi>Jew</hi> ſhould be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſollicit all ſorts of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to <hi>unite</hi> and <hi>agree;</hi> the <hi>Contrariety</hi> of his <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> would not allow Men to ſtay till they heard his Arguments, they would conclude from his <hi>Religion,</hi> that either the <hi>Man himſelf</hi> was mad, or that he thought <hi>thoſe</hi> to be ſo, whom he had the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to endeavour to perſwade.</p>
            <p>Or ſuppoſe an <hi>Adamite</hi> ſhould be very ſollicitous and active, in all places, and with all ſorts of Perſons, to ſettle the <hi>Church of England</hi> in particular, and a fair <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> for all Diſſenters; though nothing in the World has more to be ſaid for it than <hi>naked Truth,</hi> yet if ſuch a Man ſhould run up and down without Cloaths, let his Arguments be never ſo good, or his Commiſſion never ſo Authentick, his <hi>Figure</hi> would be ſuch a <hi>Contradiction</hi> to his <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> that how ſerious ſoever that might be in it ſelf, <hi>his Interpoſition</hi> would make a Jeſt of it.</p>
            <p>Though it ſhould not go ſo far as this, yet if Men have <hi>Contrarieties</hi> in their <hi>Way of Living,</hi> not to be reconciled; as if they ſhould pretend infinite <hi>Zeal</hi> for <hi>Liberty,</hi> and at that time be in great <hi>Favour,</hi> and <hi>employed</hi> by thoſe who will not <hi>endure</hi> it.</p>
            <p>If they are effectually <hi>ſingular,</hi> and conform to the Generality of the World in <hi>no one</hi> thing, but in playing the <hi>Knave.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="305" facs="tcp:48501:159"/>
            <p>If <hi>Demonſtration</hi> is a familiar Word with them, moſt eſpecially where the thing is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If they quote <hi>Authority</hi> to ſupply their Want of <hi>Senſe,</hi> and juſtifie the Value of their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not by <hi>Reaſon,</hi> but by their being <hi>paid</hi> for them (in which, by the way, thoſe who pay them have probably a very <hi>melancholly Equivalent.</hi>) If they brandiſh a <hi>Prince</hi>'s <hi>Word</hi> like a Sword in a Crowd, to make way for their own <hi>Impertinence;</hi> and in diſpute, as Criminals formerly fled to the <hi>Statue</hi> of the Prince for Sanctuary; if they ſhould now, when baffled, creep under the Protection of a Kings <hi>Name,</hi> where out of reſpect they are no farther to be purſued.</p>
            <p>In theſe Caſes, Though the Propoſitions ſhould be <hi>really</hi> good, they will be corrupted by paſſing through ſuch <hi>Conduits,</hi> and it would be a ſufficient <hi>Miſtake</hi> to enter into a <hi>Treaty;</hi> but it would be little leſs than <hi>Madneſs</hi> from ſuch Hands to expect an <hi>Equivalent.</hi>

            <p n="17">XVII. Having touched upon theſe Particulars as neceſſary in order to the ſtating the Nature of an <hi>equal Bargain,</hi> and the Circumſtances belonging to it, let it now be examined in two or three Inſtances, what things are not to be admitted by way of Contract, to paſs under the Name of an <hi>Equivalent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Though it will be allowed, that in the general Corruption of Mankind, which will not admit <hi>Juſtice</hi> alone to be a ſufficient Tye to make good a Contract, that a <hi>Puniſhment</hi> added for the Breach of it, is a <hi>fitting,</hi> or rather a <hi>neceſſary</hi> Circumſtance; yet it does not follow, that in <hi>all</hi> Caſes, <hi>a great Penalty</hi> upon the Party offending, is an <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>entire Security.</hi> It muſt be conſidered in every particular Caſe, how far the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> may rationally lead a Man to <hi>rely more</hi> or <hi>leſs</hi> upon it.</p>
            <p>In a private Inſtance, the <hi>Penalty</hi> inflicted upon the Breach of Contract muſt be, <hi>Firſt,</hi> ſuch a one as the Party injured <hi>can enforce,</hi> and <hi>Secondly,</hi> ſuch a one as he <hi>will enforce,</hi> when it is in his Power.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Offending Party</hi> is in a capacity of <hi>hindring</hi> the other from bringing the Vengeance of the Law upon him. If he hath <hi>Strength</hi> or <hi>Priviledge</hi> ſufficient to <hi>over-rule</hi> the Letter of the Contract; in that Caſe a <hi>Penalty</hi> is but a <hi>Word,</hi> there is no Conſequence belonging to it. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> The <hi>Forfeiture</hi> or <hi>Puniſhment</hi> muſt be ſuch as the Man aggrieved will <hi>take:</hi> For Example, if upon a Bargain, one of the Parties ſhall ſtipulate to ſubject himſelf, in caſe of his <hi>Failure</hi> to have his <hi>Ears cut,</hi> or his <hi>Noſe ſlit</hi> by the other, with <hi>Security given,</hi> that he ſhall not be proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for <hi>executing</hi> this part of the Agreement, the <hi>Penalty</hi> is heavy enough to diſcourage a Man from breaking his Contract; but on the other ſide it is of <hi>ſuch a kind,</hi> that the other, how much ſoever he may be provoked, will not in cold Blood care to inflict it. Such an extravagant Clauſe would ſeem to be made only for Shew and Sound, and no Man would think himſelf ſafer by a thing which one way or other is ſure to prove <hi>ineffectual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a publick Caſe, Suppoſe a Government ſo conſtituted, that a <hi>Law</hi> may be made in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a <hi>Bargain,</hi> it is in it <hi>ſelf</hi> no more than a <hi>dead Letter,</hi> the <hi>Life</hi> is given to it by the <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution</hi> of what it containeth; ſo that let it in its ſelf be never ſo perfect, it dependeth upon thoſe who are intruſted with ſeeing it <hi>obſerved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it is in any Country where the <hi>Chief Magiſtrate</hi> chuſeth the <hi>Judges,</hi> and the <hi>Judges</hi> interpret the <hi>Laws;</hi> a <hi>Penalty</hi> in any one particular Law can have no effect but what is <hi>precarious.</hi> It may have a <hi>loud Voice</hi> to threaten, but it has not an <hi>Hand</hi> to give a Blow; for as long as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Power is in poſſeſſion of this Prerogative, let who will chuſe the <hi>Meat,</hi> if they chuſe the <hi>Cooks,</hi> it is they that will give the <hi>Taſte</hi> to it. So that it is clear that the <hi>Rigor</hi> of a <hi>Penalty</hi> will not in all caſes <hi>fix</hi> a <hi>Bargain,</hi> neither is it univerſally a true Poſition, that the Increaſe of <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for the Breach of a <hi>new Law,</hi> is an <hi>Equivalent</hi> for the Conſent to part with an <hi>old</hi> one.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. In moſt Bargains there is a Reference to the <hi>time to come,</hi> which is therefore to be conſidered, as well as that which cometh within the Compaſs of the <hi>preſent</hi> Valuation.</p>
            <p>Where the <hi>Party contracting</hi> hath not a <hi>full Power</hi> to diſpoſe what belongeth on him or them in <hi>Reverſion,</hi> who ſhall ſucceed after him in his Right; he cannot make any part of what is ſo <hi>limited</hi> to be the <hi>Condition</hi> of the Contract. Further he cannot enjoyn the <hi>Heir</hi> or <hi>Succeſſor</hi> to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the Exerciſe of any Right that is inherent to him, as he is a Man: neither can he <hi>reſtrain</hi> him without his own Conſent, from doing any Act, which in it ſelf is lawful, and liable to no <hi>Objection.</hi> For Example, a <hi>Father</hi> cannot ſtipulate with any other Man, that in Conſideration of ſuch a thing done, or to be done, his <hi>Son</hi> ſhall <hi>never Marry;</hi> becauſe Marriage is an Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on eſtabliſhed by the Laws of God and Man, and therefore no Body can be ſo reſtrained by any Power from doing ſuch an Act, when he thinketh fit, being warranted by a Authority that is not to be controuled.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. Now as there are <hi>Rights inherent</hi> in Mens Perſons in their <hi>ſingle Capaſities,</hi> there are <hi>Rights</hi> as much fixed to the <hi>Body Politick,</hi> which is a Creature that never dieth.

            <p>Where this Supreme Power is <hi>mixed,</hi> or <hi>divided,</hi> the <hi>ſhape</hi> only <hi>differeth,</hi> the <hi>Argument</hi> is ſtill the ſame.</p>
            <p>The preſent State of <hi>Venice</hi> cannot reſtrain thoſe who ſucceed them in the ſame power, from having an entire and unlimited Sovereignty; they may indeed make <hi>preſent Laws</hi> which ſhall retrench their <hi>preſent Power,</hi> if they are ſo diſpoſed, and thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> if not <hi>repealed</hi> by the <hi>ſame Authority</hi> that enacted them, are to be <hi>obſerved</hi> by the ſucceeding Senate till they think fit to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate them, and no longer; for if the Supreme Power ſhall ſtill reſide in the Senate, perhaps compoſed of <hi>other</hi> Men, or of <hi>other</hi> minds (which will be ſufficient) the neceſſary conſequence is, that <hi>one</hi> Senate muſt have as much right to <hi>alter</hi> ſuch a Law, as <hi>another</hi> could have to <hi>make</hi> it.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. Suppoſe the <hi>Supreme Power</hi> in any State ſhould make a <hi>Law,</hi> to enjoyn all ſubſequent Law-makers to take an <hi>Oath</hi> never to <hi>alter it,</hi> it would produce theſe following Abſurdities.</p>
            <p>Firſt, All <hi>Supreme Power</hi> being inſtituted to promote the <hi>ſafety</hi> and <hi>benefit,</hi> and to prevent the <hi>prejudice</hi> and <hi>danger</hi> which may fall upon thoſe who live under the <hi>protection</hi> of it; the <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> of ſuch an <hi>Oath</hi> would be, that all Men who are ſo truſted, ſhall take God to witneſs, that ſuch a Law once made, being judged <hi>at the time</hi> to be <hi>advantagious</hi> for the publick, though <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards</hi> by the viciſſitude of times, or the variety of accidents or intereſts, it ſhould plainly appear to them to be <hi>deſtructive,</hi> they will ſuffer it to have its courſe, and will never repeal it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If there could in any Nation be found a <hi>ſet of Men,</hi> who having a <hi>part</hi> in the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme</hi> Legiſlative <hi>Power,</hi> ſhould as much as in them lieth, betray their Country by ſuch a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal engagement, ſo <hi>directly oppoſite</hi> to the <hi>nature</hi> of their <hi>Power,</hi> and to the <hi>Truſt</hi> repoſed in them. If theſe Men have their power only for <hi>life,</hi> when they are dead ſuch an Oath can ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>no farther;</hi> and though that would be <hi>too long</hi> a Leaſe for the Life of ſuch a <hi>Monſter</hi> as an <hi>Oath ſo compoſed,</hi> yet it muſt <hi>then</hi> certainly give up the Ghoſt. It could Bind none but the <hi>firſt</hi> makers of it, <hi>another</hi> generation would never be tied up by it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In thoſe Countries where the <hi>Supreme Aſſemblies</hi> are not conſtant <hi>ſtanding</hi> Courts, but called together upon <hi>occaſions,</hi> and compoſed of ſuch as the People chuſe for <hi>that time</hi> only, with a Truſt and Character that remaineth no longer with them than that Aſſembly is <hi>regularly diſſolved;</hi> ſuch an Oath taken by the Members of a Senate, Diet, or other Aſſembly ſo choſen, can have very little effect, becauſe at the <hi>next meeting</hi> there may be quite <hi>another ſet of Men</hi> who will be under <hi>no Obligation</hi> of that kind. The Eternity intended to that Law by thoſe that made it, will be cut off by <hi>new Men</hi> who ſhall ſucceed them in their power, if they have a <hi>differing Taſte,</hi> or another <hi>Intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="21">XXI. To put it yet further, Suppoſe a Clauſe in ſuch a Law, that it ſhall be <hi>criminal</hi> in the laſt degree for any Man choſen in a ſubſequent Aſſembly, to <hi>propoſe</hi> the <hi>repealing</hi> it; and ſince nothing can be <hi>Enacted</hi> which is not yet firſt <hi>propoſed,</hi> by this means it ſeemeth as if a Law might be created which ſhould <hi>never die</hi> But let this be Examined.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Such a Clauſe would be ſo <hi>deſtructive</hi> to the <hi>being</hi> of ſuch a Conſtitution, as that it would be as reaſonable to ſay, that a King had right to <hi>give</hi> or <hi>ſell</hi> his Kingdom to a <hi>Foreign Prince,</hi> as that any number of Men who are <hi>intruſted</hi> with the Supreme Power, or any part of it, ſhould have a right to <hi>impoſe</hi> ſuch ſhackles upon the Liberty of thoſe who are to <hi>ſucceed</hi> them in the <hi>ſame Truſt.</hi> The ground of that <hi>Trust</hi> is, that every Man who is choſen into ſuch an Aſſembly, is to do all that in him lieth for the <hi>good</hi> of thoſe who <hi>choſe</hi> him. The Engliſh of ſuch a Clauſe would be, that he is <hi>not</hi> to do his <hi>beſt</hi> for thoſe that <hi>choſe</hi> him, becauſe though he ſhould be <hi>convinc'd</hi> that it might be very <hi>fatal</hi> to <hi>continue</hi> that <hi>Law,</hi> and therefore very <hi>neceſſary</hi> to <hi>repeal</hi> it, yet he muſt not repeal it, becauſe it is made a <hi>Crime,</hi> and attended with a <hi>Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſecondly, to ſhew the <hi>emptineſs</hi> as well as <hi>injuſtice</hi> of ſuch a Clauſe, it is clear, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſuch an Invaſion of Right ſhould be impoſed, it will never be obeyed: There will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be <hi>Deformity</hi> in the <hi>Monſter,</hi> it will neither <hi>ſting</hi> nor <hi>bite.</hi> Such <hi>Law-givers</hi> would only have the honour of attempting a <hi>contradiction</hi> which can never have any ſucceſs; for as ſuch a <hi>Law</hi> in it ſelf would be a <hi>madneſs,</hi> ſo the <hi>Penalty</hi> would be a <hi>Jeſt;</hi> which may be thus made out.</p>
            <p n="22">XXII. A Law that carrieth in it ſelf <hi>Reaſon</hi> enough to <hi>ſupport</hi> it, is ſo far from wanting the <hi>protection</hi> of ſuch a Clauſe, or from <hi>needing</hi> to take ſuch an <hi>extraordinary receipt</hi> for long Life, that the <hi>admitting</hi> it muſt certainly be the <hi>likelieſt</hi> and the <hi>ſhorteſt</hi> way to <hi>deſtroy</hi> it; ſuch a Clauſe in a Law muſt imply an opinion that the <hi>greateſt</hi> part of mankind is <hi>againſt</hi> it, ſince it is impoſſible ſuch an exorbitance ſhould be done for its <hi>own ſake;</hi> the end of it muſt be to <hi>force</hi> Men by a <hi>Penalty,</hi> to that which they could <hi>not</hi> be <hi>perſwaded</hi> to, whilſt their Reaſon is left at <hi>Liberty.</hi> This Poſition being granted, which I think can hardly be denied, put the caſe that a Law ſhould be made with this <hi>imaginary</hi> Clauſe of <hi>Immortality,</hi> after which another <hi>Aſſembly</hi> is
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:48501:160"/>choſen, and if the majority of the <hi>Electors</hi> ſhall be <hi>againſt</hi> this Law, the greater part of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected</hi> muſt be <hi>ſo</hi> too, if the choice is fair and regular; which muſt be preſumed, ſince the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the contrary is not to come within this Argument. When theſe Men ſhall meet, the <hi>Majority</hi> will be viſible before-hand of thoſe who are <hi>againſt</hi> ſuch a Law, ſo that there will be no <hi>hazard</hi> to any ſingle Man in propoſing the <hi>Repeal</hi> of it, when he cannot be <hi>puniſhed</hi> but by the <hi>Majority,</hi> and he hath ſuch a kind of aſſurance as cometh near a Demonſtration, that the <hi>greater Number</hi> will be of his mind, and conſequently, that for their own ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>kes they will <hi>ſecure</hi> him from any danger.</p>
            <p>For theſe Reaſons, where-ever in order to the making a Bargain, a Propoſition is advanc'd to make a <hi>New Law,</hi> which is to tye up thoſe who neither <hi>can</hi> nor <hi>will be bound</hi> by it, it may be a good <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="23">XXIII. In the laſt place, let it be examined how far a <hi>Promiſe</hi> ought to be taken for a <hi>Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> in a Bargain.</p>
            <p>There is a great variety of Methods for the <hi>Security</hi> of thoſe that deal, according to their <hi>Diſpsſitions</hi> and <hi>Intereſts;</hi> ſome are <hi>binding,</hi> others <hi>inducing</hi> circumſtances, and are to be ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="24">XXIV. The <hi>Earneſt</hi> of making good a Promiſe, muſt be ſuch a behaviour <hi>proceding</hi> as may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>A <hi>Word</hi> is not like a Bone, that being broken and well ſet again, is ſaid to be ſometimes ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in that very part: It is far from being ſo in a <hi>Word</hi> given and <hi>not made good.</hi> Every ſingle Act either <hi>weakeneth</hi> or <hi>improveth</hi> our Credit with o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>All Obligations are <hi>comparative,</hi> and where they ſeem to be oppoſite, or between the greater and the Leſſer, which of them ought to have precedence in all reſpects every man is apt to be his <hi>own Judge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="25">XXV. If it ſhould fall out that the <hi>Promiſer</hi> with full <hi>intent</hi> at the <hi>time</hi> to perform, might by the interpoſition of <hi>new Arguments,</hi> or <hi>differing Advice</hi> think himſelf oblig'd to turn the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Conſcience on the <hi>other</hi> ſide, and ſhould look upon it to be much a <hi>greater</hi> fault to <hi>keep</hi> his word than to <hi>break</hi> it; ſuch a Belief will <hi>untye</hi> the <hi>ſtricteſt Promiſe</hi> that can be made, and though the Party thus abſolving himſelf ſhould do it <hi>without</hi> the mixture or temptation of <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="26">XXVI. A <hi>Promiſe</hi> is to be underſtood in the <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> ſenſe of the words, and to be fare not in his who <hi>made</hi> it, if it was given as part of a Bargain. That would be like giving a Man power to <hi>raiſe</hi> the <hi>value</hi> of his Mony in the payment of his <hi>Debt,</hi> by which though he paid but half or leſs, he might pretend according to the letter to have made good the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</p>
            <p>The <hi>power</hi> of <hi>interpreting</hi> a Promiſe intirely taketh away the <hi>virtue</hi> of it. A Merchant who ſhould once aſſume that priviledge, would ſave himſelf the trouble of making any more Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains.</p>
            <pb n="308" facs="tcp:48501:161"/>
            <p>It is ſtill worſe if this <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> over a Man's <hi>Promiſe,</hi> ſhould be <hi>lodg'd</hi> in hands that have Power to ſupport ſuch an <hi>extraordinary Claim;</hi> and if in <hi>other</hi> Caſes, for bearing to deal upon theſe terms is <hi>adviſable,</hi> in this it becometh abſolutely <hi>neceſſary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="27">XXVII. There muſt in all reſpects be a full liberty to <hi>claim</hi> a Promiſe, to make it reaſonable to <hi>take</hi> it in any part of payment; elſe it would be like agreeing for a <hi>Rent,</hi> and at the ſame time making it <hi>Criminal</hi> to <hi>demand</hi> it.</p>
            <p>A <hi>ſuperiority</hi> of <hi>Dignity</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> in the Party promiſing, maketh it a more <hi>tender</hi> thing for the other party to treat upon that ſecurity. The firſt maketh it a <hi>nice</hi> thing to <hi>claim,</hi> the latter maketh it a <hi>difficult</hi> thing to <hi>obtain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſome caſes, a <hi>Promiſe</hi> is in the nature of a <hi>Covenant,</hi> and then between <hi>equal</hi> parties the breach of it will bear a <hi>Suit;</hi> but where the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of the Promiſer is very much raiſed above the Level of <hi>equality,</hi> there is no Forfeiture to be taken. It is ſo far from the party grieved his being able to <hi>ſue</hi> or <hi>recover Damages,</hi> that he will not be allow'd to <hi>explain</hi> or <hi>expoſtulate,</hi> and inſtead of his being <hi>relieved</hi> againſt the breach of Promiſe, he will run the hazard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>puniſhed</hi> for breach of Good Manners. Such a difficulty is putting all or part of the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Fire, where Men muſt burn their Fingers before they can come at it.</p>
            <p>That cannot properly be called <hi>good payment,</hi> which the party to whom it is due, may not receive with <hi>eaſe</hi> and <hi>ſafety.</hi> It was a King's Brother of <hi>England</hi> who refuſed to lend the Pope mony, for this reaſon, <hi>That he would never take the Bond of one, upon whom he could not diſtrain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Argument is ſtill <hi>ſtronger</hi> againſt the validity of a Promiſe, when the Contract is made between a <hi>Prince</hi> and a <hi>Subject.</hi> The very offering a King's Word in Mortgage, is rather a <hi>threatning</hi> in caſe of Refuſal, than an <hi>inducing</hi> Argument to accept it; it is <hi>unfair</hi> at <hi>firſt,</hi> and by that giveth greater cauſe to be cautious, eſpecially if a thing of that <hi>value</hi> and <hi>dignity</hi> as a King's Word ought to be, ſhould be put into the hands of <hi>State-brokers</hi> to ſtrike up a Bargain with it.</p>
            <p n="28">XXVIII. When God Almighty maketh Coveant with Mankind, <hi>His promiſe</hi> is a <hi>ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Security,</hi> notwithſtanding his <hi>Superiority</hi> and his <hi>power;</hi> becauſe firſt, he can neither <hi>err</hi> nor do <hi>injuſtice.</hi> It is the <hi>only</hi> Exception to his Omnipotence, that by the Perfection of his <hi>being</hi> he is incapacitated to do <hi>wrong.</hi> Secondly, at the <hi>inſtant</hi> of <hi>His promiſe,</hi> by the extent of his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight which cannot fail, there is no room left for the poſſibility of any thing to <hi>intervene,</hi> which might <hi>change</hi> his mind. Laſtly, he is above the receiving either <hi>Benefit</hi> or <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience,</hi> and therefore can have no <hi>Intereſt</hi> or <hi>Temptation</hi> to vary from his Word, when once he hath granted it.</p>
            <p>Now though Princes are God's Vicegerents, yet their Commiſſion not being ſoo <hi>large</hi> as that <hi>theſe Qualifications</hi> are devolved to them, it is quite another caſe, and ſince the <hi>offering</hi> a Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty implyeth it to be <hi>examined</hi> by the party to whom it is propoſed, it muſt not be taken ill that Objections are made to it, even though the Prince himſelf ſhould be the <hi>immediate Propoſer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let a familiar Caſe be put; Suppoſe a Prince, tempted by a Paſſion to ſtrong for him to reſist, ſhould deſcend, ſo as to promiſe Marriage to one of his Subjects, and as Men are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally in great haſte upon ſuch occaſions, ſhould preſs to take poſſeſſion before the <hi>neceſſary Forms</hi> could be complyed with, would the poor Ladies <hi>Scruple</hi> be called <hi>Criminal</hi> for not taking the Security of the Royal Word? Or would her <hi>Allegiance</hi> be tainted by her <hi>reſiſting</hi> the ſacred Perſon of her Soveraign, becauſe he was impatient of delay? <hi>Courteſie</hi> in this caſe might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade her to <hi>accept</hi> it, if ſhe was ſo diſpoſed, but ſure the <hi>juſt exerciſe</hi> of Power can never <hi>claim</hi> it.</p>
            <p n="29">XXIX. There is one Caſe where it is more particularly a <hi>Duty</hi> to uſe very <hi>great occaſion</hi> in accepting the ſecurity of a Promiſe, and that is, when Men are <hi>Authorized</hi> and <hi>truſted</hi> by <hi>others</hi> to act for them.

            </p>
            <p>The Obligation is yet <hi>more</hi> binding when the Truſt is of a <hi>Publick</hi> Nature.

               <hi>Intereſt</hi> is an uncertain thing, It goeth and cometh, and varieth according to times and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; as good build upon a <hi>Quick-ſand,</hi> as upon a preſumption that Intereſt ſhall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Where are the Men ſo diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of Mankind, that it is impoſſible for them to miſtake their Intereſt? Who are they that have ſuch an Exemption from human frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as that it can never happen to them not to ſee their Intereſt for want of Underſtanding, or not to leap over it by exceſs of Zeal.</p>
            <p>Above all, <hi>Princes</hi> are moſt liable to miſtake; not out of any <hi>defect</hi> in their Nature, which might put them under ſuch an unfortunate diſtinction; quite contrary, the blood they derive from great and wiſe Anceſtors, does rather diſtinguſh them on the better ſide; beſides that their great Character and Office of Governing, giveth a noble Exerciſe to their Reaſon, which can very hardly fail to raiſe and improve it. But there is one Circumſtance annexed to their Glorious Calling, which in this Reſpect is ſufficient to outweigh all thoſe Advantages; it is that Mankind, divided in moſt things elſe, agree in this, to conſpire in their Endeavours to deceive and miſlead them, which maketh it above the Power of human Underſtanding, to be ſo exactly guarded, as never to admit a Surprize, and the higheſt Applauſe that could ever yet be given to the greateſt Men that ever wore a Crown, is that they <hi>were no oftner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have ventured to lay down my Thoughts of the <hi>Nature</hi> of a <hi>Bargain,</hi> and the <hi>due Circumſtances</hi> belonging to an <hi>Equivalent,</hi> and will now conclude with this ſhort Word. <q>Where <hi>Diſtruſting</hi> may be the Cauſe of provoking <hi>Anger,</hi> and <hi>Truſting</hi> may be the Cauſe of bringing <hi>Ruine, the Choice is too eaſie to need the being explained.</hi>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Do not wonder at your Concern for finding an Order of Council publiſhed in the <hi>Gazette</hi> for Reading the King's Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience in all Churches and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels in this Kingdom. You deſire to know my Thoughts about it, and I ſhall freely tell them; for this is not a time to be reſerved. Our Enemies who have given our Gracious King this Counſel againſt us, have taken the moſt effectual way, not only to ruine us, but to make us appear the Inſtruments of our own Ruine, that what Courſe ſoever we take, we ſhall be undone; and one ſide or other will conclude that we have undone our ſelves, and fall like Fools.</p>
            <p>To loſe our Livings and Preferments, nay, our Liberties and our Lives in a plain and direct Oppoſition to Popery, as ſuppoſe for refuſing to read Maſs in our Churches, or to ſwear to the <hi>Trent</hi> Creed, is an honorable way of falling, and has the Divine Comforts of Suffering for Chriſt and his Religion; and I hope there is none of us but can chearfully ſubmit to the Will of God in it. But this is not our preſent Caſe; to read the Declaration, is not to read the Maſs,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:48501:162"/>nor to profeſs the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Faith; and therefore, ſome will judge that there is no hurt in Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and that to ſuffer for ſuch a Refuſul, is not to fall like Confeſſors, but to ſuffer as Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals for diſobeying the Lawful Commands of our Prince; but yet we judge, and we have the concurring Opinions of all the Nobility and Gertry with us, who have already ſuffered in this Cauſe, that to take away the Teſt and Penal Laws at this time, is but one ſtep from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing of Popery; and therefore to read ſuch a Declaration in our Churches, though it do not immediately bring Popery in, yet it ſets open our Church Doors for it, and then it will take its own time to enter: So that ſhould we comply with this Order, all good Proteſtants would deſpiſe and hate us, and men we may be eaſily cruſhed, and ſhall ſoon fall with great Diſhonour, and without any Pity. This is the Difficulty of our Caſe; we ſhall be cenſured on both ſides, but with this Difference: We ſhall fall a little ſooner by not Reading the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, if our Gracious Prince reſent this as an Act of an obſtinate and peeviſh, or factious Diſobedience, as our Enemies will be ſure to repreſent it to him; We ſhall as certainly fall, and not long after, if we do read it, and then we ſhall fall unpitied and deſpiſed, and it may be with the Curſes of the Nation, whom we have ruined by our Compliance; and this is the way never to riſe more: And may I ſuffer all that can be ſuffered in this World, rather than contribute to the ſinal Ruine of the beſt Church in the World.</p>
            <p>Let us then examine this Matter impartially, as thoſe who have no mind either to ruine themſelves, or to ruine the Church: I ſuppoſe no Miniſter of the Church of <hi>England</hi> can give his Conſent to the Declaration. Let us then conſider, whether Reading the Declaration in our Churches be not an Interpretative Conſent, and will not with great Reaſon be interpreted to be ſo: For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> By our Law all Miniſterial Officers are accountable for their Actions: The Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Superiors, though of the King himſelf, cannot juſtifie inferior Officers, much leſs the Miniſters of State, if they ſhould execute any illegal Commands; which ſhews that our Law does not look upon the Miniſters of Church or State to be meer Machines and Tools, to be managed wholly by the Will of Superiors, without exerciſing any Act of Judgment or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon themſelves; for then inferior Miniſters were no more puniſhable, than the Horſes are, which draw an innocent Man to <hi>Tyburn:</hi> and if inferior Miniſters are puniſhable, then our Laws ſuppoſe that what we do in obedience to Superiors, we make our own Act by doing it, and I ſuppoſe that ſignifies our Conſent, in the Eye of the Law, to what we do. It is a Maxime in our Law, <hi>That the King can do no Wrong;</hi> and therefore if any Wrong be done, the Crime and Guilt is the Miniſters who does it: for the Laws are the King's publick Will, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is never ſuppoſed to command any thing contrary to Law; nor is any Miniſter, who does an illegal Action, allowed to pretend the King's Command and Authority for it: and yet this is the only Reaſon I know, why we muſt not obey a Prince againſt the Laws of the Land, or the Laws of God, becauſe what we do, let the Authority be what it will that commands it, becomes our own Act, and we are reſponſible for it; and then as I obſerved before, it muſt imply our own Conſent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Miniſters of Religion have a greater Tye and Obligation than this, becauſe they have the Care and Conduct of Mens Souls, and therefore are bound to take Care that what they publiſh in their Churches, be neither contrary to the Laws of the Land, nor to the Good of the Church: For the Miniſters of Religion are not look'd upon as Common Cryers, but what they Read, they are ſuppoſed to recommend too, though they do no more than Read it; and therefore to read any thing in the Church, which I do not conſent to and approve, nay, which I think prejudicial to Religion, and the Church of God, as well as contrary to the Laws of the Land, is to miſguide my People, and to diſſemble with God and Men; becauſe it is preſum'd, that I neither do, nor ought to read any thing in the Church, which I do not in ſome degree approve. Indeed, let Mens private Opinions be what they will, in the Nature of the thing, he that reads ſuch a Declaration to his People, teaches them by it: For is not Reading Teaching? Suppoſe then I do not conſent to what I read, yet I conſent to Teach my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple what I Read: and herein is the Evil of it; for it may be it were no Fault to Conſent to the Declaration; but if I conſent to Teach my People what I do not conſent to my ſelf, I am ſure that is a great one: And he who can diſtinguiſh between conſenting to Read the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and conſenting to Teach the People by the Declaration, when Reading the Declaration is teaching it, has a very ſubtile Diſtinguiſhing Conſcience. Now if conſenting to Read the Declaration be a Conſent to Teach it my People, then the natural Interpretation of Reading the Declaration is, That he who Reads it in ſuch a ſolemn Teaching-manner, Approves it. If this be not ſo, I deſire to know, why I may not read an Homily for Tranſubſtantiation, or Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Saints, or the Worſhip of Images, if the King ſends me ſuch good Catholick Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:48501:162"/>and commands me to read them? And thus we may inſtruct our People in all the Points of Popery, and recommend it to them with all the Sophiſtry and Artificial Infintrations, in Obedience to the King, with a very good Conſcience, becauſe without our Conſent: If it be ſaid, this would be a Contradiction to the Doctrine of our Church by Law eſtabliſhed; ſo I take the Declaration to be: And if we may read the Declaration contrary to Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it does not imply our Conſent to it; ſo we may Popiſh Homilies, for the bare Reading them will not imply our Conſent, no more than the Reading the Declaration does: But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I conſent to the Doctrine or no, it is certain I conſent to teach my People this Doctrine; and it is to be conſidered, whether an honeſt Man cand do this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſuppoſe no Man will doubt, but the King intends that our Reading the Declaration ſhould ſignifie to the Nation, our Conſent and Approbation of it; for the Declaration does not want Publiſhing, for it is ſufficiently known already: but our Reading it in our Churches muſt ſerve inſtead of Addreſſes of Thanks, which the Clergy generally refuſed, though it was only to Thank the King for his Gracious Promiſes renewed to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in His Declaration, which was much more innocent, than to publiſh the Declaration it ſelf in our Churches. This would perſwade one, that the King thinks our Reading the Declaration, to ſignifie our Conſent, and that the People will think it to be ſo. And he that can ſatisfie his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, to do an Action without Conſent, which the Nature of the Thing, the Deſign, and intention of the Command, and the Senſe of the People expound to be a Conſent, may, I think, as well ſatisfie himſelf with Equivocations and mental Reſervations.</p>
            <p>There are two things to be anſwered to this, which muſt be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the People underſtand our Minds, and ſee that this is Matter of Force upon us, and meer Obedience to the King. To which I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Poſſibly the People do underſtand that the Matter of the Declaration is againſt our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: But is this any Excuſe, that we read that, and by Reading, recommend that to them, which is againſt our own Conſciences and Judgments? Reading the Declaration would be no Fault at all, but our Duty, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> the King commands it, did we approve of the Matter of it; but to conſent to teach our <hi>People</hi> ſuch Doctrines as we think contrary to the Laws of God, or the Laws of the Land, does not leſſen, but aggravate the Fault, and the <hi>People</hi> muſt be very good natured to think this an Excuſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is not likely that all the <hi>People</hi> will be of a Mind in this Matter, ſome may excuſe it, others, and thoſe it may be the moſt, the beſt, and the wifeſt Men, will condemn us for it, and then how ſhall we juſtifie our ſelves againſt their Cenſures? when the World will be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in their Opinions, the plain way is certainly the beſt, to do what we can juſtifie our ſelves, and then let Men judge as they pleaſe. No Men in <hi>England</hi> will be pleaſed with our Reading the Declaration, but thoſe who hope to make great Advantage of it againſt us, and againſt our Church and Religion: others will ſeverely condemn us for it, and cenſure us as falſe to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and as Betrayers both of Church and State: and beſides that, it does not become a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Religion, to do any thing, which in the Opinion of the moſt charitable Men can only be excuſed; for what needs an Excuſe, is either a Fault, or looks very like one; beſides this, I ſay, I will not truſt Mens Charity; thoſe who have ſuffered themſelves in this Cauſe, will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe us for fear of ſuffering; thoſe who are inclined to excuſe us now, will not do ſo when they conſider the thing better, and come to feel the ill Conſequences of it: when our Enemies open their Eyes, and tell them what our Reading the Declaration ſignified, which they will then tell us we ought to have ſeen before, though they were not bound to ſee it; for we are to guide and inſtruct them, not they us.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Others therefore think, that when we read the Declaration, we ſhould publickly profeſs, that it is not our own Judgment, but that we only Read it in Obedience to the King, and then our Reading it cannot imply our Conſent to it: Now this is only <hi>Proteſtatio contra ſactum,</hi> which all People will laugh at, and ſcorn us for: for ſuch a ſolemn Reading it in time of Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, when all Men ought to be moſt grave and ſerious, and far from diſſembling with God or Men, does in the Nature of the thing imply our Approbation; and ſhould we declare the contrary, when we read it, what ſhall we ſay to thoſe who ask u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, why then do you read it? But let thoſe who have a mind to try this way, which, for my part, I take to be a greater and more unjuſtifiable Provocation of the King, than not to read it; and, I ſuppoſe thoſe who do not read it, will be thought plainer and honeſter Men, and will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> as well as thoſe who read it and proteſt againſt it: and yet nothing leſs than an expreſs Proteſtation againſt it will
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:48501:163"/>ſalve this Matter; for only to ſay, they read it meerly in Obedience to the King, does not expreſs their Diſſent: It ſignifies indeed, that they would not have read it, if the King had not commanded it; but theſe Words do not ſignifie, that they diſapprove of the Declaration, when their Reading it, though only in Obedience to the King, ſignifies their Approbation of it as much as Actions can ſignifie a Conſent: let us call to mind how it fared with thoſe in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt's Reign, who read the <hi>Book of Sports,</hi> as it was called, and then preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
            <p>To return then to our Arguments; if Reading the Declaration in our Churches be in the Nature of the Action, in the Intention of the Command, in the Opinion of the People, an interpretative Conſent to it, I think my ſelf bound in Conſcience not to read it, becauſe I am bound in Conſcience not to approve it:</p>
            <p>It is againſt the Conſtitution of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which is eſtabliſhed by Law, and to which I have ſubſcribed, and therefore am bound in Conſcience to Teach nothing contrary to it, while this Obligation laſts.</p>
            <p>It is to teach an unlimit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d and univerſal Toleration, which the Parliament in 72. Declared illegal, and which has been condemned by the Chriſtian Church in all Ages:</p>
            <p>It is to teach my People, that they need never come to Church more, but have my free Leave, as they have the King's, to go to a Conventicle or Maſs.</p>
            <p>It is to teach the Diſpencing Power, which alters, what has been formerly thought the whole Conſtitution of this Church and Kingdom, which we dare not do, till we have the Authority of Parliament for it.</p>
            <p>It is to recommend to our People, the Choice of ſuch Perſons to ſit in Parliament, as ſhall take away the <hi>Teſt</hi> and <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> which moſt of the Nobility and Gentry of the Nation have declared their Judgment againſt.</p>
            <p>It is to condemn all thoſe great and worthy Patriots of their Country, who forfeited the deareſt thing in the World to them, next a good Conſcience, <hi>viz.</hi> The Favour of their Prince, and a great many honorable and profitable Employments with it, rather than conſent to that Propoſal of taking away the <hi>Teſt</hi> and <hi>Penal Paws,</hi> which they apprehend deſtructive to the <hi>Church of England</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtant Religion;</hi> and he who can in Conſcience do all this, I think need ſcruple nothing.</p>
            <p>For let us conſider further, what the Effects and Conſequences of our Reading the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are likely to be, and I think they are Matter of Conſcience too, when they are evident and apparent.</p>
            <p>This will certainly render our Perſons and Miniſtry infinitely contemptible, which is againſt that Apoſtolical Canon, <hi>Let no Man deſpiſe thee,</hi> Titus 2.15. That is, ſo to behave himſelf in his Miniſtereal Office, as not to fall under Contempt; and therefore this obliges the Conſcience, not to make our ſelves ridiculous, nor to render our Miniſtry, our Counſels, Exhortations, Preaching, Writing, of no Effect, which is a thouſand times worſe than being ſilenced: Our Sufferings will preach more effectually to the People, when we cannot ſpeak to them: but he who for Fear or Cowardiſe, or the Love of this World, betrays his Church and Religion by undue Compliances, and will certainly be thought to do ſo, may continue to Preach, but to no purpoſe; and when we have rendred our ſelves ridiculous and contemptible, we ſhall then quickly fall, and fall unpitied.</p>
            <p>There is nothing will ſo effectually tend to the final Ruine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Reading the Declaration will diſcourage, or provoke, or miſguide all the Friends the Church of <hi>England</hi> has: can we blame any Man for not preſerving the Laws and the Religion of our Church and Nation, when we our ſelves will venture nothing for it? Can we blame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man for conſenting to Repeal the <hi>Teſt</hi> and <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> when we recommend it to them by Reading the Declaration? Have we not reaſon to expect, that the Nobility and Gentry, who have already ſuffered in this Cauſe, when they hear themſelves condemned for it in all the Churches of <hi>England,</hi> will think it time to mend ſuch a Fault, and reconcile themſelves to their Prince? and if our Church fall this way, is there any reaſon to expect that it ſhould ever riſe again? Theſe Conſequences are almoſt as evident as Demonſtrations, and let it be what it will in it ſelf, which I foreſee will deſtroy the <hi>Church of England</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion</hi> and <hi>Intereſt,</hi> I think I ought to make as much Conſcience of doing it, as of doing the moſt immortal Action in Nature</p>
            <p>To ſay that theſe miſchievous Conſequences are not abſolutely neceſſary, and therefore do not affect the Conſcience, becauſe we are not certain they will follow, is a very mean Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Moral Actions indeed have not ſuch neceſſary Conſequences, as natural Cauſes have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Effects, becauſe no moral Cauſes act neceſſarily: Reading the Declaration, will not as neceſſarily deſtroy the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as Fire burns Wood, but if the Conſequence be
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:48501:163"/>plain and evident, the moſt likely thing that can happen, if it be unreaſonable to expect any other, if it be what is plainly intended and deſigned, either I muſt never have any regard to Moral Conſequences of my Actions, or if ever they are to be conſidered, they are in this caſe.</p>
            <p>Why are the Nobility and Gentry ſo extreamly averſe to the Repeal of the Teſt and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Laws? Why do they forfeit the King's Favour, and their Honourable Stations, rather than comply with it? If you ſay that this tends to deſtroy the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the Proteſtant Religion, I ask whether this be the neceſſary conſequence of it? whether the King cannot keep his promiſe to the Church of <hi>England</hi> if the Teſt and Penal Laws be Repealed? We cannot ſay, but this may be: And yet the Nation does not think fit to try it; and we commend thoſe great men who deny it; and if the ſame queſtions were put to us, we think we ought in Conſcience to deny them our ſelves: And are there not as high probabilities, that our Reading the Declaration will promote the Repeal of the Teſt and Penal Laws, as that ſuch a Repeal will ruine our Conſtitution, and bring in Popery upon us? Is it not as proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ſuch a complyance in us, will diſoblige all the Nobility and Gentry, who have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been firm to us, as that when the power of the Nation is put into Popiſh Hands, by the Repeal of ſuch Teſts and Laws, the Prieſts and Jeſuirs may find ſome <hi>ſalvo</hi> for the King's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and perſwade him to forget his Promiſe to the Church of <hi>England?</hi> and if the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ill conſequences of Repealing the Teſt and Penal Laws, be a good reaſon not to comply with it, I cannot ſee but that the as probable ill conſequences of Reading the Declaration, is as good a reaſon not to read it.</p>
            <p>The moſt material Objection is, that the Diſſenters, whom we ought not to provoke, will expound our not Reading it, to be the effect of a perſecuting Spirit: Now I wonder Men ſhould lay any weight on this, who will not allow the moſt probable conſequences of our Actions, to have any influence upon Conſcience: For if we muſt compare conſequences, to diſoblige all the Nobility and Gentry by reading it, is likely to be much more fatal, than to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Diffenters, and it is more likely, and there is much more reaſon for it, that one ſhould be offended than the other: For the Diſſenters who are wiſe and conſidering, are ſenſible of the ſnare themſelves, and though they deſire Eaſe and Liberty, they are not willing to have it with ſuch apparent hazard of Church and State: I am ſure that tho' we were never ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous that they might have their Liberty, (and when there is opportunity of ſhewing our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations without danger, they may find that we are nations without danger, they may find that we are not ſuch Perſecutors as we are repreſented) yet we cannot conſent that they ſhould have it this way, which they will find the deareſt Liberty that ever was granted.</p>
            <p>This Sir, is our Caſe in ſhort, the Difficulties are great on both ſides, and therefore now if ever we ought to beſiege Heaven with our Prayers for Wiſdom, and Counſel, and Courage; that God would protect his Church and Reformed Chriſtianity, againſt all the devices of their Enemies: Which is the daily and hearty Prayer of,</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER <hi>To the City Miniſter's</hi> LETTER, <hi>from his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Friend.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is not for me now to acknowledge my private Debt to you for the favour of your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſince the publick is as much concern'd in it as I: and if I may judge of all by the compaſs of my Neighbourhood and Acquaintance, I may aſſure you, they are not inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of your Obligation, though they are ignorant of the Author.</p>
            <p>The Country as far as my Intelligence reaches, has followed the Example of the City, and refuſed to read the Declaration of Indulgence according to a certain Order ſaid to be the Kings, which we in the Country can ſcarce believe to be His. For it has neither been ſignified to the Ordinaries according to the uſual manner, nor could thoſe that diſperſed it give any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count whence it came to them. I have heard indeed that an Act of Council concerning it has been publiſhed in the <hi>Gazette,</hi> which I never ſaw, and if I had I ſhould ſcarce have thought Authentick: For I always took that Paper as for its Authority, to have been all of a piece, and that we were no more bound to take notice of any Order publiſhed there under any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, than we are to believe all the News from <hi>Poland</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Nay though this Order had come to us in due form, yet had we had great reaſon to ſuſpect ſomething of ſurreption and ſurprize upon his Majeſty in this matter, and that it could not proceed from his Majeſty's free and full conſent; for we cannot yet forget his repeated profeſſions of kindneſs to us, and of ſatisfaction in our Principles and Duty, and having done nothing ſince which might forfeit his goed Opinion, we are unwilling to believe that it is His Majeſties own mind and pleaſure to loud us with ſuch an Order, as we cannot execute with any congruity, ſafety or good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</p>
            <p n="1">I. As to his Majeſties Declaration, We of all his Majeſties Subjects are the leaſt concern'd in it; and with all duty be it ſpoken, we cannot ſee, that our legal Eſtabliſhment receives any Addition by this Declaration. For there are yet, thanks be to God, no Penal Laws to which our Congregations are obnoxious, and therefore we do not ſtand in need of any Toleration: Yet it is upon us only that the Reading of it is impoſed. An Act which cannot well be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued otherwiſe than as a ſoliciting and tempting our own people to forſake our Communion. If this Declaration muſt needs be read in any Religious Aſſemblies' in reaſon ſurely it ſhould be in thoſe, who wholly owe their ſubſtance to it. It would better have become the <hi>Roman</hi> than the <hi>Proteſtan</hi> Chappels. But in the <hi>Koman</hi> Church <hi>Indulgence</hi> hath another ſignification; and belongs to thoſe only that frequent their Churches, but not to ſuch as leave them: for with them this is the only ſin that is not capable of Indulgence. But the Prieſts deſire to be excus'd, leſt while they proclaim Toleration to others they bring an Interdict upon themſelves. Or why I pray, was not Father <hi>Pen</hi> Ordered to publiſh it in his Meetings? Or the worthy Mr. <hi>Lob,</hi> the reputed Father of this Project; why had not he the benefit of his own Invention, and a Patent for being the ſole Publiſher of it within his own Pound? Or why was not my <hi>Lord Mayor</hi>'s private and elect Congregation thought worthy of ſo great a grace? Surely it is not to draw upon us the envy of the Diſtenters, that the honour of publiſhing this Declaration is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon us alone, when it belongs to all other Communions in the Kingdom, except our own: And it we refuſe it, I hope it will be imputed to our Modeſty, for we are not ambitious of being impertinent or buſie bodies in other mens matters.</p>
            <p>A certain perſon much greaten than he deſerves, but perhaps not ſo high, is ſaid to have uſed the Words of <hi>Rabſhaketh</hi> upon this occaſion, <hi>That the Church of</hi> England <hi>Clergy ſhould eat their own Dung.</hi> Iſa. 36.12. This ſentence might better have become a Meſſenger of the King of <hi>Affyria,</hi> than a pretended Counſellour of our own Prince, though ſome make a queſtion to which King he belongs: But God be thanked, we are not yet ſo ſtraitly beſieg'd as to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to that extremity, and though by the permiſſion of God, We ſhould be reduc'd to ſo miſerable a Condition, We ſhould I hope, by the Grace of God, be content to endure that
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:48501:164"/>and worſe extremities if poſſible, rather than Betray or Surrender the City of God. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that comes, it is poſſible that the Throat that belch'd out this Naſty Inſolence, may be ſtopp'd with ſomething which it cannot ſwallow.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Beſides there are ſome paſſages in the Declaration, which in Conſcience we cannot read to our People, though it be in the King's Name; for among others we are to Read theſe Words: <hi>We cannot but heartily wiſh as will eaſily be believed, that all the People of our Dominions were Members of the Catholick Church.</hi> Our People know too well the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of this, and could not but be ſtrangely ſurpriz'd to hear us tell them, that it would be an acceptable thing to the King, that they ſhould leave the Truth and our Communion, and turn Papiſts. The Wiſh of a King when ſolemnly Declared, is no light inſignificant thing, but has real influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and effect upon the minds of Men. It was but a Wiſh of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second that cut off <hi>F. Becket</hi> then Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> Councils and Courts of Juſtice too often bend to a King's Wiſhes, though againſt their own Inclinations, as well as againſt their Rule: And can we imagine that they can have no force at all upon the common people? Therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in Conſcience pronounce theſe words in the Ears of the people whoſe Souls are committed to our Charge. For we ſhould hereby lay a ſnare before them, and become their Tempters inſtead of being their Inſtructers; and in very fair and reaſonable Conſtruction we ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to ſollicite them to Apoſtacy, to leave the Truth of the Goſpel, for Fables, and the miſtakes of men; a reaſonable and decent Worſhip, for Superſtition and Idolatry; a true Chriſtian Liberty, for the moſt intollerable Bondage both of Soul and Body. If any will forſake our Doctrine and Fellowſhip, which yet is not ours but Chriſts, at their own peril be it: But as for us, We are reſolv'd by the Grace of God, to lay no ſtumbling block in their way, nor to be acceſſary to their ruin, that we may be able to declare our integrity with <hi>S. Paul,</hi> That <hi>we are pure from the blood of all Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. In the next place. We are to declare in the King's Name, <hi>That from henceforth the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of all, and all manner of Penal Laws, in matters Eccleſiaſtical, for not coming to Church, or not receiving the Sacrament, or for any other Nonconformity to the Religion Eſtabliſhed, or for, or by Reaſon of the Exerciſe of Religion, in any manner whatſoever, be immediately Suſpended, and the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Execution of the ſaid Penal Laws, and every of them is hereby Suſpended.</hi> What! <hi>All,</hi> and <hi>all manner of Laws in matters Eccleſiaſtical?</hi> VVhat the Laws againſt Fornication, Adultery, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt? For theſe are in Ecclefiaſtical matters. VVhat! All Laws againſt Blaſphemy, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs, open Deriſion of Chriſtian Religion? Yet theſe crimes are puniſhable by no other Laws here, than ſuch as have been made in favour of the Eſtabliſhed Religion: How ſhall the Lord's day be obſerv'd? VVhat ſhall hinder covetous men to plow and Cart, and follow their ſeveral Trades upon that day? ſince all the Laws, that ſecure this obſervance, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward countenance of reſpect to the Chriſtian Religion, are by this general expreſſion laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide: Beſides theſe words, <hi>for not coming to Church, or not receiving the Sacrament, or for any other Nonconformity to the Religion Eſtabliſhed,</hi> cannot in Conſcience be read by us in our Churches becauſe they may be a Temptation to young unguided people to neglect all manner of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worſhip, and give them occaſion of depriving themſelves of ſuch opportunities of grace and ſalvation, as theſe Penal Laws did often oblige them to uſe. For being diſcharg'd atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on our Service, they are left at Liberty to be of any Religion or none at all: Nay Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion is by theſe general terms left at diſcretion, as well as the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For men may forſake us to become Jews or Mahometans, or Pagan Idolaters, as well as to be Papiſts or Diſſenters for any care taken in this Declaration to prevent it. And even of ſuch as pretend to be Chriſtians, there either are or may be ſuch Blaſphemous Sects, ſo diſhonourable to our Common Lord and Maſter, as are incapable of all publick encouragement and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; for that would involve the Government in the Imputation of thoſe Blaſphemies, and the whole Nation in that Curſe and Vengeance of God, which ſuch provocations may extorts Wherefore it is not out of any unreaſonable opinion of our ſelves, nor diſaffection to Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Diſſenters, that we refuſe to publiſh this Indulgence, but out of a tender care of the Souls committed to us, eſpecially thoſe of the weaker ſort, to whom we dare not propoſe an Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Popery, and much leſs any thing that may give countenance or encouragement to Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion. It is ſaid indeed, that we are not required to approve but to read it: To this Sir, you have very well anſwer'd, that Reading was Teaching it, or if it be not ſo abſolutely in the nature of the thing; yet in common Conſtruction, I am afraid it would have been underſtood. But we do not ſtand in need of this Excuſe, for if there be any paſſages in it, that are plain temptations to Popery or Licentiouſneſs; it cannot conſiſt with our duty ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to God or the Church to read them before our people.</p>
            <p>As for the diſpenſing power, and the Oaths and Teſts required to qualifie men for Offices Military and Civil, I muſt leave them to the Conſideration of thoſe who nearer concern'd, and therefore reaſonably preſum'd to underſtand them better. Nor do I envy his Majeſty the uſe
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:48501:165"/>of his Popiſh Subjects, though I do not know what ſervice they may be capable of doing more than other Men. This Nation has for ſome time made hard ſhift to ſubſiſt without much of their Aid, and againſt the wills of ſeveral of them: But now they are become the only neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary men, and ſeem to want nothing but Number to fill all places Military and Civil in the Kingdom; in the mean time the Odiouſneſs of their perſons, and the Inſolence of their Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour with their way of menacing ſtrange things, makes ſome abatement of the merit of their ſervice.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The reſpect which we have for his Majeſties Service, will not permit us to Read the Appendix to the Declaration: Where the flower of the Nobility and Gentry of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are ſomething hardly reflected on, as perſons <hi>that will not contribute to the peace and honour of the Nation;</hi> becauſe they would conſent to the taking away the Laws againſt Papiſts, that they be put into a Condition to give us Laws. The perſons here reflected on, VVe know to be the chief for Ability and Intereſt, and Inclination to ſerve the King, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do his His Majeſty that diſſervice as to be publiſhers of their diſgrace, and make our ſelves the Inſtruments of alienating from his Majeſty the Affections of his beſt Subjects. Nay we find in our ſelves a ſtrange difficulty to believe that this could come from His Majeſty, who has experienc'd their faithfulneſs upon ſo many and preſſing Occaſions. This could not well proceed from any but a Stranger to thoſe Honourable perſons, and the Nation, and a greater Stranger to ſhame and good manners; and what have we to do to publiſh the Venome and Vitulency of a Jeſuit.</p>

               <hi>A Letter from a Gentleman in</hi> Ireland, <hi>to his Friend in</hi> London, <hi>upon occaſion of a Pamphlet, Entituled,</hi> A Vindication of the preſent Government of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> under his Excellency, <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connel.</hi>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS ſoon as the Letter, Entituled, <hi>A Vindication of the preſent Government of</hi> Ireland, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> came to my hands, I ſet upon Anſwering it with the ſame expedition, and plainneſs of Style, as uſes to accompany naked Truth, which needs not the cloathing of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtical Arguments, or florid Expreſſions, to recommend it to the unprejudic'd part of Mankind: And indeed upon the very firſt reading of every Paragraph of it, the ſlightneſs of the Arguing, or the notorious Falſhood of the Matter of Fact, did ſo evidently appear, that a man of ordinary capacity needs not put his Natural Talent on the Rack to refute them.</p>
            <p>The very firſt poſition of the paper, <hi>viz.</hi> [That <hi>Ireland</hi> is in a better way of Thriving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Government of a <hi>Native,</hi> than an <hi>Engliſhman;</hi>] (by which, I ſuppoſe, you mean one not barely ſo by Birth, but by Inclination, Intereſt, Education, Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) is ſo falſe, that it contradicts the Experience and Reaſon of Mankind, and diſguſts one ſo much in the front of the Letter, that I was tempted to fling it away unread, judging it not worth the loſs of ſo much time, if the reſt ſhould prove of the ſame kind (as indeed I found it upon peruſal;) but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ventured through it, I looked upon my ſelf obliged to ſay ſomething by way of Anſwer, ſince in the opinion of ſome ſort of Men, the not Anſwering (though even the moſt trifling Pamphlet) is given out to be the Inability of the party to reply to the weight of ſuch Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as are contained in it.</p>
            <p>I will not inſiſt much upon the conſtant practice of all the predeceſſors of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Kings, and their Counſellors, ever ſince the Conqueſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who made it an eſtabliſht Maxim, in relation to that Kingdom, That none but an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> ſhould be Chief Governour; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that (till within theſe two Years) that practice gave occaſion to the common erroneous opinion, That a man born in <hi>Ireland,</hi> however otherwiſe qualified, was thereby incapacitated from being Lord Deputy: It is certain, that long before the Reformation, when Matters of Religion made no diſtinction between the Natives of each Country, this was the ſettled and unalter'd Rule: Have we any reaſon then to alter it, (now that Religion is put into the Scale, and become the additional weight, which never fails giving the advantage to the ſide it eſpouſes and adheres to) or raſhly to condemn the wiſe proceedings of the Anceſtours of our Kings, and (contrary to the opinion of the VVorld) judge our Author's <hi>Iriſh</hi> Underſtanding, better than all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ones that have been heretofore?</p>
            <pb n="317" facs="tcp:48501:165"/>
            <p>Our Author will certainly allow <hi>Ireland</hi> to be a conquered Country, and conſequently, that the Conquerors have Right to eſtabliſh Laws with ſuch Reſtrictions and Limitations, as ſhall ſeem fitting and convenient towards the keeping it in their Hands, and the Welfare of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, which are of two Sorts, the <hi>Britiſh Planters,</hi> and the <hi>Natives.</hi> I ſhall prove, that it has been, and ſtill is, the Advantage of both theſe, that <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould be governed by an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the way, I would have it underſtood, that I do not pretend to put theſe two Intereſts into any Ballance: I know the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt does ſo far outweigh the other, that it were a Wrong done it, to bring them into any Competition; more than two parts of three of the Lands of <hi>Ireland,</hi> being (by the ſeveral Rebellions of the <hi>Iriſh</hi>) in <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hands; and for the Quality, Temper, Induſtry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there is no Compariſon: beſides, that if one of two Parties is to be pleaſed (though by the Detriment of the other) 'tis but juſt, that the Conquerors (who have Right to give Law) ſhould be indulged; how much more when it is conſiſtent with the Welfare of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> themſelves, if they underſtood their own Good?</p>
            <p>I am convinced, that whatever has been done in favour of the Natives, is pure Grace, and cannot be claimed as a juſt Debt, any otherwiſe, than ſince it has been confirmed by our Laws, and Acts of Parliament: He that reflects on 1641. will readily aſſent to this, which makes me admire at the pertneſs of our Author, in Capitulating, as if we ſtood upon even Ground with them; but 'tis plain, he conſiders the Intereſt but of one Party in that Kingdom, and though he names <hi>Ireland</hi> often, he means the Native <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſt only. But I proceed;</p>
            <p>To prove that it is the Intereſt of the <hi>Britiſh,</hi> that <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould be governed by an <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:</hi> Ineed ſay no more than that they all ardently deſire it; and People are the beſt Judge of their own Neceſſities: The common Maxim, <hi>That Intereſt will not lye,</hi> holds good here to ſome purpoſe. The ill Effects the contrary Method has had on their Perſons and Eſtates, is but too viſible. Whoever had ſeen <hi>Ireland</hi> four Years ago, and would compare its Condition with what it is now, from the moſt thriving and flouriſhing <hi>Country</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> from a place of the briskeſt Trade, and beſt paid Rents in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> it is fallen in one Year and a half's time, to Ruine and Deſolation: in the moſt frequent <hi>Cities,</hi> empty Houſes, and melancholly <hi>Countenances;</hi> in the beſt people'd <hi>Counties,</hi> unmanur'd neglected Fields, and Solitarineſs: Such a one, I ſay, might juſtly exclaim, <hi>Heu! Quantum mutatus ab illo.</hi> But it would be impertinent to inſiſt any longer on this. I muſt now prove, That 'tis the Advantage of the very Natives themſelves (who have long been uneaſie under the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, and often endeavour'd to ſhake it off) to be ruled and guided by that Nation they hate ſo much. They are beholding to us for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them from a State of Barbarity, which left but little difference between them and Brutes: We taught them to Live, to Eat, Drink, and Lodge like humane <hi>Creatures;</hi> (if they eſteem this any Advantage, and do not really prefer their Native Wildneſs to all the Benefits of civil Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Trade, Agriculture, Merchandizing, Learning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and if the Gentleneſs of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government could have had any Influence on them, they had no reaſon to be diſcontented at it: They had the equal Protection of the Laws, in relation to their Eſtates and Perſons; they bore but their juſt Proportion in all Taxes and Ceſſes: Their Lands improved in Value, by the Means of their <hi>Britiſh</hi> Neighbours, and their Rents were much better paid than formerly, whileſt themſelves were Maſters of the whole Iſland: They had a large Connivance for the Exerciſe of their Religion, and were even allowed to hold a National Synod of their own <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> in <hi>Dublin, Anno</hi> 1666. The poor Natives were not oppreſſed, when their ſevere Land-Lords, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gentry, by their <hi>cruel Extortions, Caſherings, Duties,</hi> and <hi>Days Labour</hi> ruined them; who as ſoon as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manners prevailed among them (as they were introduced with Difficulty enough, there was need of the Authority of Acts of Parliament to conſtrain them for their own Good) lived plentifully, and in convenient Houſes, had their Share of the current Coin, and proportion of all other Neceſſaries, to the Life and Well-being of Man, which now they want; inſomuch that ſeveral of them have been heard to curſe my Lord <hi>Tyrconnel;</hi> for to his Government they attribute their Miſery, and acknowledge, they never lived ſo well as under the Direction of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Rulers, nor expected to do ſo again, till they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the Helm. See the Force of Truth, which compels the Confeſſion of it, even from the Mouths of its Adverſaries!</p>
            <p>One may eaſily perceive by our Authers manner of arguing, where the Shoo pinches; he is really concerned that <hi>Ireland</hi> is not altogether an independent Kingdom, and in the Hands of its own Natives: he longs till the Day, when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Yoak of Boudage ſhall be thrown off: Of this he gives us broad Hints, when he tells us That [<hi>England</hi> is the only Nation in the World that impedes their Trade:] That [a Man of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt will never Club with them (as he phraſes it) or project any thing which may tend to their Advantage, that will be the leaſt Bar or Prejudice to the Trade of <hi>England.</hi>] Now, why a Man of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt (unleſs he will allow none of that Nation to be an able and juſt Miniſter to his Prince) ſhould
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:48501:166"/>be partial, to ruine one Kingdom [to avoid the leaſt Inconveniency of the other] contrary to the poſitive Commands of his King, I cannot imagine: For ſince [it is the Governour's Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Rule by Law, and ſuch Orders as he ſhall receive from His Majeſty.] I know no Grounds for our Authors Arraigning the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, in ſaying, That no one Man among them, of what Perſwaſion ſoever, will be true, either to the Laws, or his Majeſty's poſitive Orders, which ſhall ſeem repugnant to the ſmalleſt Conveniencies of <hi>England.</hi> This is a glory reſerved only (as it ſeems) for his Hero, my Lord <hi>Tyrconnel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Imbargo upon the <hi>Weſt India</hi> Trade, and the Prohibition of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cattel, are the two Inſtances given.</p>
            <p>It were to be wiſhed indeed, for the Good of that Kingdom, that both were taken off; and I queſtion not but to ſee a Day wherein it ſhall ſeem proper to the King, and an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, to Repeal thoſe Laws; a Day wherein they will conſider us as their own Fleſh and Blood, a Colony of their Kindred and Relations, and take care of our Advantages with as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Grudging and Repining (I am ſure they have the ſame, and no ſtronger Reaſon) as <hi>Cornwal</hi> does at <hi>Yorkſhire:</hi> There are Inſtances in ſevral Iſlands in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> as far diſtant as <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is from <hi>England,</hi> that make up but one Kingdom, and govern'd by the ſame Laws; but the Wiſdom of <hi>England</hi> will not judge it time fitting to do this, till we of <hi>Ireland</hi> be one Mans Children, either in Reality or Affection; we wiſh the latter, and have made many Steps and Advances towards it, if the Natives will not meet us half way, we cannot help it, let the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent lie at their own Doors.</p>
            <p>But after all, I ſee not how thoſe Inſtances have any manner of relation to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Chief Governors in <hi>Ireland;</hi> they were neither the Cauſes, Contrivers, nor Promoters of thoſe Acts. The King and an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament did it without conſulting them; if they had, 'tis forty to one, my Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> and the Council, whoſe Stake is ſo great in <hi>Ireland,</hi> would have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it as much as poſſible. Our Author's Argument proves indeed, That 'tis detrimental to <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be a ſubordinate Kingdom to <hi>England</hi> (and 'tis plain, 'tis that he drives at, let him diſguiſe it as much as he will) but the concluſion he would prove, cannot at all be deduced from it: Shortly, I expect he will ſpeak plainer, and in down right Terms propoſe, That the two Kingdoms may be governed by different Kings; Matters ſeem to grow ripe for ſuch a dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyal Propoſition.</p>
            <p>If theſe Acts (and not the Subjection to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> King) were the Grievances, they would be ſo to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> there, as well as to the Natives: but though we wiſh them Repealed, we do not repine; in the mean time, if the <hi>Britiſh,</hi> who are the moſt conſiderable Trading part of that Nation, and conſequently feel the ill Effects of thoſe Acts more ſenſibly, can be contented, why the Natives ſhould not acquieſce in it (unleſs it be for the forementioned Reaſons) I cannot ſee.</p>
            <p>Our Author allows that there are different ways of obeying the King: 'tis a Point gained for us, and proves there may be ſuch a Partiality exerciſed in executing his Majeſties Commands, as may deſtroy the very Intent of them; and yet (taking the Matter ſtrictly [the King is obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed] but a good Miniſter will conſider his Maſters Intentions, and not make uſe of a Word that may have a double Sence to the Ruine of a Kingdom, nor of a Latitude of Power, wherewith he is intruſted, to the Deſtruction of the moſt conſiderable Party in it: Far be it from us to think it was his Majeſties Intentions to depopulate a flouriſhing Country, to undo Multitudes of laborious thriving Families in it, to diminiſh and deſtroy his own Revenue, to put the Sword into Mad-mens Hands, who are ſworn Enemies to the <hi>Britiſh:</hi> No! His Majeſty, who is willing that Liberty of Trade as well as Conſcience, ſhould equally flouriſh in all parts of his Dominions, that recommends himſelf to his Subjects by his Impartiality in diſtributing Offices of Truſt; and from that Practice raiſes his greateſt Argument to move his People to Repeal the <hi>Penal Laws;</hi> never intended that ſome general Commands of his ſhould be perverted to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of that <hi>People,</hi> his Intention is to protect. His Majeſty (Great as he is) cannot have two Conſciences, one calculated for the Latitude of <hi>England,</hi> another for <hi>Ireland.</hi> We ought therefore to conclude (in reſpect to the King) that his Commands have been ill underſtood, and worſe executed; and this may be done (as our Author confeſſes) and the King [undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obeyed;] but ſuch an Obedience is no better than a Sacrifice of the beſt Subjects the King has in this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Our Author has given very good Reaſons why the Natives may be well content with their preſent Governor, but I cannot forbear laughing at thoſe he has found out to ſatisfie the poor <hi>Britiſh</hi> with My Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s moſt Excellent, Charitable, Engliſh Lady: His high ſounding Name <hi>TALBOT,</hi> in great Letters, a Name that no leſs frightens the Poor Engliſh in <hi>Ireland,</hi> then it once did the <hi>French;</hi> a Name which becauſe he is in poſſeſſion of, I will not diſpute his Title to, but I have been credibly informed, that he has no relation to that moſt Noble Family of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> (though my Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> preſumes to bear the ſame Coat of Arms:) a Name in ſhort, which I hope in time <hi>Vox &amp; praetereae nihil.</hi>

            <p>A third Reaſon is drawn from his Stake in <hi>England;</hi> the Author would do well to ſhew us, in what Country this lies, that we may know where to find Repriſals hereafter; for ſince he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers this for our Security, 'tis fit to enquire into the Title and Value of the Land, before we give ſo valuable a Conſideration.</p>
            <p>Thus this great heap of ſubſtantial Reaſons, together with a large Panegyrick upon his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency's fair Face and good Shapes, telling us by the by, how he [was not kill'd at <hi>Drogheda,</hi> becauſe he run away,] is enough, and more than enough to demonſtrate, that [the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> have not the leaſt cauſe to be dejected, becauſe they are ſufficiently ſecure:] But I will agree with the Author in this, that he ſeems to have been reſerved by Heaven againſt the moſt cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical occaſion, that ſhould happen in this Age, reſerv'd as one of the Vials of God's Wrath to plague the People.</p>
            <p>'Tis well known [Self-preſervation is allowed by God and Man;] and ſince he tells us, we are [People of a contrary Intereſt,] he gives us right to provide for our ſelves, and our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, as well as we may; 'tis like a generous Aggreſſor: Firſt he declares who are his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, then gives them warning to put themſelves into a poſture of Defence. We are behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him for this hint, and, I hope, ſhall make the right uſe of it. 'Tis below me to take notice of the meaneſs of the Expreſſion of [an honeſt Man's loſing his Head in a Crowd,] and the nonſence of the other, [The moſt men bite at the ſtone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] Dogs indeed uſe to do ſo with us; but this is only to let the World know what Country man our Author is, and it may be 'tis the cuſtom here for theſe Men to imitate thoſe more rational Creatures.</p>
            <p>Our Author ſeems ſenſible, that many hard hings have been done, which occaſioned Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours againſt the preſent Government; though I think our Grievances (how intollerable ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) have been born more ſilently, than any people ſince the Creation: Since I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber any one Pamphlet has hitherto come out, to repreſent them; ours being of that nature, as ſtupifies us, and takes away the uſe of the Tongue and Pen: <hi>Curae leves loquuntur, ingentes ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent:</hi> I ſay he is not willing this load of Calumny ſhould reſt on my Lord <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> but caſts it on His Majeſty, imagining that the reſpect we bear, (and juſtly) to our King, ought to render us Tongue-ty'd in relation to the Male-Adminiſtration of his Miniſter. But I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewn, how the King's Orders may be ſtretched, and perverted. The very beſt and moſt cautiouſly penn'd Laws have a double edge, and (if the Executive Power be lodg'd in ill Hands) have the worſt Effect, even to the Puniſhment of Well doers, and the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them that do Ill; and I queſtion not, in the leaſt, but this is our Caſe, and as little doubt that our Grievances would be redrets'd, did not one of His Majeſties moſt Eminent Vertues interpoſe between us and His Grace, I mean his Conſtancy to his old Servants; and our Condition is ſo much the more deplorable, that His Majeſty cannot be a Father of His Country without ſeeming to deſert His Miniſter; but 'tis to be hoped that at long running, the Groans of a diſtreſſed Nation will prevail over all private Conſideration.</p>
            <p>Whether the Employment His Majeſty has given my Lord <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> has not prov'd the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the Augmentation of his Fortune, (as our Author inſinuates it has not) ſhall neither prove the Subject of this Diſcourſe, nor Object of our Envy. I ſhall only ſay, if the report be true, that my Lord owes all his Eſtate to the King's bounty, 'tis ungratefully done to rob His Majeſty of the Honour and Thanks due to him, by denying it; much leſs is it our buſineſs to find fault with the advancement of five <hi>Relations.</hi> In this point Authors differ, for ſome ſpeak 55 at leaſt: If there had not been the greateſt Partiality in the World ſhewed, we ſhould never have open'd our mouths, if in an Army of about 9000 <hi>Engliſh</hi> Officers and Souldiers, there be not 200 left, (in a Country where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have ſo much cauſe to fear) and thoſe turn'd out for the moſt part, without any cauſe aſſign'd, after the moſt ignominious diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner imaginable, ſtript naked in the Field, their Horſes, Boots, Buff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:48501:167"/>If theſe and an hundred other things do not juſtifie the retreat of ſeveral of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> I know not what ſhall be adjudged a ſufficient reaſon. This our Author would inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate, is cauſed by a ſullen Combination; as if the Gentry of a Nation could agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to do a thing ſo contrary to their viſible Intereſt, as deſert their Houſes and Eſtates, to the loſs of one half of them, meerly out of ſpite to the Government.</p>
            <p>But becauſe our Author is ſo good at his Narratives, and would induce the World to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there was but two Regiments disbanded [by his talking only of two] and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place ſpeaking of [ſome Officers] that were Caſhiered. VVe ſhall hereafter give a faithful Account of the Proceedings in the buſineſs of Disbanding; and in the mean time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that his whole Account of the Affair at <hi>Molingar</hi> is moſt unſincere. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were given to underſtand, that they were all to be turned out, and the only Grace his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency did them, was to declare before a long and tedious March, that ſuch as had a mind, or had Settlements in that Country might better quit then, than hereafter. This is plainly ſhewn by the turning out (afterwards) all thoſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> who then actually continued in the Service; they were glad that any would quit voluntarily, but thoſe that did not, and after a publick Tryal, were willing to ſerve his Majeſty, they ſoon after turn'd out. Thus the falſe gloſs that our Author puts upon my Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s Speech is diſcover'd: And I aſſure the Reader, the Memoires I have by me are from ſuch unqueſtionable hands, and there are ſo many hundred living VVitneſſes to the Truth of them, that our Author will not have the Impudence to deny what may be prov'd before his Majeſty, if he require it. I ſhall only take notice of the ill Application of our Authors Sea-Metaphor. Though in ſtreſs of weather, the Owner is willing to make uſe of all hands that may be helpful towards the ſaving the Veſſel, yet he takes care to call for none whoſe practice it hath been to cut the Tacklings, and to ſteer contrary to the Pilot's Directions; he thinks ſuch ſafer by far ſhut up under Hatches, then ſet at Liberty or employ'd to do miſchief: As for his ſuppoſition of 30000 men to be ſent out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> into <hi>Handers,</hi> I cannot tell what to make on't. Let them crack the Shell that hope to find the Kernel in it. For my part I deſpair, though the readineſs of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Souldiers of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who at twenty four hours warning came into <hi>England</hi> to ſerve His Majeſty in the time of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Rebellion, ought to have been remembered to their advantage, and might ſerve (to any unprejudic'd perſon) as a Pattern of the Loyalty, and good Inclinations of all the Proteſtants in that Kingdom, if his Majeſty had had occaſion for them. VVhether the Parliament will Repeal the <hi>Teſt</hi> for thoſe ſeveral weighty Reaſons our Author ſays [are fitter for contemplation than Diſcourſe] tho methinks it would be pleaſant to ſee a Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſit like the Brethren at a ſilent Meeting, is not my Province to determine: As likewiſe, VVhether they will ſo much conſider that Grand Reaſon [the King will have it ſo] (for his Conſcience and theirs may differ) or what the diffenters will do, I cannot tell. One thing I am ſure of, there will be no ſuch Stumbling-block in the way of the King's deſires, when they meet, as the preſent condition of <hi>Ireland;</hi> they will be apt (when His Majeſty tells them, they ſhall have their equal ſhares in Employments, when they have Repealed the Laws) to ſay, Look at <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſee what is done there, where the Spirit of Religion appears bare fac'd! and accordingly compute what may become of us, when we have removed our own legal Fences, ſince they now leap over thoſe Hedges, what may we expect when they are quite taken away!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Poyning</hi>'s Law is a great grievance to our Author, and here in one word, he diſcovers that 'tis the dependance this Kingdom has on <hi>England,</hi> he quarrels at: 'Tis fit the Reader ſhould underſtand, that Law (enacted when <hi>Poynings</hi> was Lord Deputy) makes all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Acts of Parliament of force in <hi>Ireland;</hi> we are therefore ſo fond of that Law, and cover ſo much to preſerve our dependance on <hi>England,</hi> that all the Arguments our Author can bring, ſhall not induce us to part with it.</p>
            <p>I will not reflect in the leaſt on the Courage of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> I know there are ſeveral brave men among them, but they have had the misfortune to fall under the Conſideration of (as our Author ſoftens it, but the plain ſence is, been beaten by) a warlike Nation: And, I queſtion not, unleſs they behave themſelves modeſtly in their Proſperity, they will again fall under the Conſideration of the ſame Nation: 'tis better we ſhould live in peace and quietneſs, but the Choice is in their hands, and if they had rather come under our conſideration again, than avoid it, let them look to the Conſequence.</p>
            <p>Another advantage which may accrue to <hi>Ireland,</hi> by a Native, as a Governour, our Author reckons to be, <hi>His perſonal knowledge of the</hi> Tories, <hi>and their Harbourers, and his being thereby better capacitated to ſuppreſs them.</hi> Malicious People would be apt to infer from this Suggeſtion, that his Excellency had occaſion formerly to be familiarly acquainted with ſuch ſort of Cattle. I have heard indeed, that one of our braveſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Princes, <hi>Henry</hi> the—during the Extravagancies of his youth, kept Company with publick Robbers, and often ſhar'd both in the Danger and Booty: But as ſoon as the Death of his Father, made way for his Succeſſion to the Crown, he
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:48501:167"/>made uſe of his former acquaintance of their Perſons and Haunts, to the extirpating and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving the greateſt knot of Highway-men, that ever troubled <hi>England.</hi> My Lord therefore (in imitation of this great Prince, no doubt) will make uſe of his Experience that way, to the ſame end: And I readily aſſent to the Author, that no <hi>Engliſh</hi> Governour can be ſo fit to clear that Kingdom of Tories, and that for the ſame reaſon he gives us</p>
            <p>There are two other Advantages remaining; one is, his Excellency's having already made different Parties in that Kingdom, the Objects of his Love and Hatred, let the Offences of the one, or the Merits of the other, be never ſo conſpicuous: Whether the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> can draw any comfort from his Excellency's knowledge of them this way, is fit to be debated. The other is, the probality of his getting the Statute for benefit of Clergy, in favour of Cow-Stealers, and Houſe Robbers Repealed; and where, by the way, there is a ſevere Rebuke given to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prieſts, for their ill-placed Mercy to <hi>Iriſh</hi> Offenders: A fault I hope they will be no more guilty of.</p>
            <p>Whether theſe Advantages be ſo conſiderable as to move his Majeſty to continue a Man (for other more weighty Reaſons) abſolutely deſtructive to this Kingdom, or whether ſome of them might not be performed by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Governour, His Majeſty is the only Judge: Only this I am ſure of, The King (if he were under any Obligations to His Miniſter) has fully diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them all, and has ſhewed himſelf to be the beſt of Maſters, in giving ſo great and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable an Employment to his Creature, and continuing him in it ſo long, notwithſtanding the decreaſe of his own Revenue, and the other viſible bad effects of his Management; the Impoveriſhment of that Kingdom, amounting to at leaſt two Millions of Mony: And His Majeſty may be now at liberty (without the leaſt imputation of Breach of promiſe to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant) to reſtore us to our former flouriſhing condition, by ſending ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobleman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, whoſe contrary Methods will, no doubt, produce different effects.</p>
            <p>To conclude, methinks the compariſon between His Majeſty and <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> when he was drunk, is a little too familiar, not to ſay unmannerly, and that between <hi>Antipater,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> is as great a Complement to the latter.</p>
            <p>But provided my Lord be commended, which was our Author's chief deſign, he cares not tho' the compariſon does not hold good in all points; 'tis enough that we know we are Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by ſuch a Prince that neither practiſes ſuch Debauches himſelf, nor allows of them in his Servants. But we are not beholding to the Author for the knowledge of this; ſhould a Foreigner read his Pamphler, or get it interpreted to him, he would be apt (and with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) to conclude, that His Majeſty as much reſembled <hi>Philip</hi> in a Debauch, as my Lord <hi>Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connel</hi> doth ſober <hi>Antipater.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now done with all that ſeems of any weight in our Author's Pamphlet; and can ſee nething in his Poſtſcript that deſerves an Anſwer. All that I will ſay is. That his <hi>Recipes</hi> bear no proportion to our deſperate Diſeaſe, and he will prove not to be a Phyſitian, but a pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Quack, who by ill applied Medicines will leave us in a worſe Condition than he found us.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude with telling you, That your Letter, which encloſed the Pamphlet, whereof I have here given you my thoughts, was more than a Fortnight on the way, or elſe you had received this ſooner, I am,</p>

            <head>A PLAIN ACCOUNT OF THE PERSECUTION Laid to the CHARGE of the Church of England.</head>
            <p>THE Deſire of Liberty to ſerve God in that Way and Manner which Men judge to be moſt acceptable to him, is ſo Natural and Reaſonable, that they cannot but be extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoked againſt thoſe who would force them to ſerve him in any other. But the Conceit withal, which moſt Men have, that their Way of Serving God is the only acceptable Way; naturally inclines them, when they have Power, to uſe all Means to conſtrain all other to ſerve him in that way only. So that Liberty is not more deſired by all, at one time, than it is denied by the very ſame Perſons at another. Put them into different Conditions, and they are not of the ſame Mind: but have different Inclinations, in one State, from what they have in another. As will be apparent by a ſhort View of what hath paſſed in theſe Churches and Kingdoms, within our Memory.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Before the late Civil Wars, there were very grievous Complaints made of the Biſhops; that they preſſed the Ceremonies ſo ſtrictly, as to inflict heavy Cenſures upon thoſe called <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> who could not in Conſcience conform to them. Now no ſooner had thoſe very Perſons who thus complaned, got their Liberty to do as they pleaſed, but they took it quite away from the other: and ſuqueſtred all thoſe who would not enter into their <hi>Holy League and Covenant;</hi> for the reforming all things according to the Model which they propounded. Nay, they were not willing to bear with <hi>Five</hi> Diſſenting Brethren among themſelves; who could not conform to the <hi>Presbyterial</hi> Government. And when theſe Diſſenting Brethren, commonly known by the Name of <hi>Independants,</hi> had got a Party ſtrong enough, which carried all before them; they would not allow the uſe of the <hi>Common Prayer</hi> in any Pariſh; no not to the <hi>King</hi> himſelf in his own Chappel: not grant to one of the old Clergy, ſo much Liberty as to teach a School, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which things I do not mention (God knows) to reproach thoſe who were guilty of them; but only to put them in mind of their own Failings: that they may be humbled for them, and not inſult over the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor ſeverely upbraid them with that, which when time was, they acted with a higher Hand themſelves. If I ſhould report all that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> did here, and in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and all that the <hi>Independants</hi> did here and in <hi>New England;</hi> it would not be thought that I exceed the Truth, when I ſay they have been more Guilty of this Fault, than thoſe whom they now charge with it. Which doth not excuſe the Church of <hi>England,</hi> it muſt be confeſſed, but doth in ſome Meaſure mitigate her Fault. For the Conformable Clergy having met with ſuch very hard Uſage in that diſinal Time, wherein many of them were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed above Meaſure; no wonder if the Smart of it, then freſh in their Minds, ſomething imbittered their Spirits; when God was preaſed, by a wonderful Revolution, to put them into Power again.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Then a ſtricter <hi>Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nifamity</hi> was made, and ſeveral Laws purſuant to it, for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreing that Uniformity, by ſevere Penalties. But let it be remembred that none were by thoſe Laws conſtrained to come to Church, but had Liberty left them to ſerve God at Home (and ſome Company with them in their own Way. And let it be farther remembred, that the Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Look into <hi>France</hi> (with which we have had the ſtricteſt Alliance and Friendſhip along time) and behold, how at this Moment they compel thoſe to go to Maſs, who they know abhor it as an abominable Idolatry.

            <p>As to the firſt of theſe, ſince there hath been no Council from the firſt Alienation of <hi>Abby-Lands</hi> in <hi>England</hi> to this Day, that pretends to be general, but that of <hi>Trent;</hi> we need only look into that for the Satisfaction of ſuch <hi>Roman Catholicke</hi> as eſteem a General Council above the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> And I am ſure that that Council is ſo far from confirming theſe <hi>Abby-Lands</hi> to the preſent Poſſeſſors, that it expreſly denounceth them accurſed that detain them. <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 22. <hi>Decret. de Ref.

               </gap>t of which Lands are to this very day poſſeſs'd by Papiſts. Now though there may be ſome Plea for the Popes Authority, in the interim of a general Council, and in ſuch things wherein they have made no determination; yet in this matter there is no colour for any pretences, ſince the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was actually aſſembled within ſew years after theſe Alienations, and expreſly condemned the poſſeſſors of <hi>Abby Lands,</hi> and after all this was all conſirm'd and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the Pope himſelf in his <hi>Bulla Super conf. gen. Concil. Trid. A. D.</hi> 1564. And tho' we have here the Judgment of the infallible See, as to this matter in the Conſirmation of the <hi>Trent Council,</hi> yet becauſe there be ſome that magnifie the Popes extravagant and unlimited power over the Church, and pretend that he confirm'd the <hi>Abby-Lands</hi> in <hi>England</hi> to the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſors of them, I ſhall ſhew. Secondly, That the Pope neither hath, nor pretends to any ſuch Power, nor did ever make uſe of it in this matter under debate; only I ſhall premiſe, that whereas ſome part of the Canon Law ſeems to allow of ſuch particular alienations as are made by the Clerks and Members of the Church, with the conſent of the Biſhop, yet ſuch free conſent was never obtained in <hi>England,</hi> and as to what was done by force, fraud, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, is of ſo little moment as to giving a legal Title, that even the alienations that were made by <hi>Charles Martell,</hi> who is among the Papiſts themſelves as infamous for Sacriledge as King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, yet even his Acts are ſaid to be done by a Council of Biſhops as is acknowledg'd by Dr. <hi>Johnſton</hi> in his aſſurance of <hi>Abby Lands,</hi> p. 27. I ſhall proceed to ſhew, Firſt, That the Pope hath no ſuch power as to confirm theſe Alienations, and this is expreſly determined by the infallible Pope <hi>Damaſus</hi> in the Canon-Law. <hi>Cauſ.</hi> 12.9.2. c. 20. <hi>The Pope cannot alienate Lands belonging to the Church in any manner, or for any neceſſity whatſoever, both the buyer and the ſeller lie under an</hi> Anathema <hi>till they be reſtored, ſo that any Church-man may op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſe any ſuch Alienations, and again require the Lands and Profits ſo Alienated.</hi> So that here we have a full and expreſs Determination of the infallible See. And tho in Anſwer to this it is urg'd by Dr. <hi>Johnſton,</hi> that this Canon is with ſmall difference publiſhed by <hi>Binius</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and ſo as to confine it to the ſuburbicacy Dioceſs of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet that this Anſwer is wholly trivial, will appear.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe if the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath no Authority to confirm ſuch alienations in his own peculiar Dioceſs where he hath moſt power, much leſs can he do it in the Provinces where his power is leſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That in all Eccleſiaſtical Courts of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is not <hi>Binius</hi>'s Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Councils, but <hi>Gratian</hi>'s Collection of Canons, that is of Authority, in which Book theſe words are as here quoted.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Since this Book of the Popes Decree hath been frequently reprinted by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Command of ſeveral Popes, and conſtantly uſed in their Courts; this is not to be look'd upon as a Decree of Pope <hi>Damaſus</hi> only, but of all the ſucceeding Popes, and in the opinion of <hi>F. Ellis,</hi> (<hi>Sermon before the King, Decem.</hi> 5. 1686. <hi>p.</hi> 21.) what is inſerted in the Canon Law is become the whole Judgment of the whole-Church.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It's abſolutely forbid by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thirteenth, in his Bull preſixed before the Canon-Law (<hi>A. D.</hi> 1580.) for any one to <hi>add, or invert any thing in that Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that according to this expreſs Determination in the Popes own Law, the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> have no power to confirm any ſuch Alienations as have been made in <hi>England,</hi> and agreeable to all this Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the Fourth, (the very perſon that is pretended to have confirm'd theſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienations) declar'd to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſadors that were ſent upon that Errand; <hi>That if he had Power to grant it, he would do it moſt readily, but his Authority was not ſo large. F. Paul's H.</hi> of Council of <hi>Trent, Lond. A. D.</hi> 1629. And therefore all Confirmations from the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> are already prejudg'd to be invallid, and of no force at all.</p>
            <p>Secondly, No Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> did ever confirm them. The Breve of Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the Third which gave Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> the largeſt powers towards the effecting this, had this expreſs limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Salvo tamen in his, quibus propttr renem magnitudinem &amp; gravitatem haec Sancta ſedes merito tibi videtur conſulenda, noſtro &amp; prefatae ſedis beneplacito &amp; confirmatione,</hi> i. e. Saving to us in theſe <q>matters (in which by reaſon of their weight and greatneſs this Holy See may juſtly ſeem to you,</q> that of right it ought to be conſulted) the good pleaſure and confirmation of us and
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:48501:171"/>of the holy See, which is the true <hi>Engliſh</hi> to that <hi>Latin,</hi> and that this whole Kingdom did then ſo underſtand theſe words, is evident from the Ambaſſadors that were ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> the next Spring, <hi>Viz.</hi> Viſcount <hi>Moitecute,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Carn;</hi> (Theſe being one to repreſent every ſtate of the Kingdom,) to obtain of him a Confirmation of all thoſe Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> had granted. <hi>Burnet's H. Ref p.</hi> 2. <hi>f.</hi> 300. So that in the eſteem of the whole Nation, what the Cardinal had done was not valid without the Confirmation of the Pope himſelf. Now this Pope <hi>Julius,</hi> and the next <hi>Marcellus</hi> both died before there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pretence of any Confirmation from <hi>Rome;</hi> but this was at length done by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Fourth, is pretended, and for proof of it three things are alledged, Firſt, The Journals of the Houſe of Commons where are theſe words, <hi>After which was read a Bill from the Popes Holineſs, confirming the doing of my Lord Cardinal, touching the aſſurance of Abby Lands, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, a Bull of the ſame Pope to Sir <hi>Will Peters.</hi> Thirdly, The Decrees of Cardinal <hi>Peol,</hi> and his Life by <hi>Dudithius:</hi> To all which I anſwer,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That its confeſs'd on all hands, that there is no ſuch Bull or Confirmation by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Fourth, to be any where found in the whole World, not any Copy or Tranſcript of it, not in all the <hi>Bullaria,</hi> nor our own Rolls and Records, tho' it be a matter of ſo great moment to the Roman Catholicks of <hi>England,</hi> and what cannot be produced may eaſily be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. Nor can it be imagined that a Journal of Lay-perſons that were parties concerned, or a private Bull to Sir <hi>Will, Peters,</hi> or ſome hints in the Decrees and Life of the Cardinal will be of any moment in a Court at <hi>Rome,</hi> whenſoever a matter of that vaſt conſequence, as all the <hi>Abby Lands</hi> in <hi>England</hi> ſhall come to be diſputed, eſpecially if it be obſerved, that this very Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the Houſe of Common<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> is no publick Record, but <hi>hath paſt through private hands, hath been corrupted and defaced, and that in Paſſages of the greateſt moment,</hi> as are the words of <hi>W. Hakewell</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> in his Obſervation upon them 70 Years ſince, printed <hi>A D.</hi> 1641. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Journals of the Houſe of Lords are true Records, and kept by their proper Officer; there is not one word to befound of any ſuch confirmation,</p>
            <p>Secondly, If there ever was any ſuch Buil, it had this limitation in it, that the Poſſeſſors of ſuch Lands ſhould beſtow them all on Colleges, Hoſpitals, parochial Miniſters, or other ſuch like ſpiritual Uſes? and this <hi>I</hi> prove,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe the famous Inſtances that are uſually given of the Popes Alienations of Church Lands, were only a changing them from one religious Uſe to another. Thus when Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Fifth, <hi>A. D.</hi> 1307. ſuppreſt the <hi>Knights-Templars</hi> in this Nation, and ſeiz'd all their Lands and Goods, he gave them all to the Hoſpitaller of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that was ratified in Parliament, 17. <hi>Edw.</hi> Second, which Act ſets forth, <hi>That tho thoſe Lands were eſcheated to the Lords of the Fee by the ſaid Diſſolution, yet it was not lawful to detain them.</hi> When Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Seventh, <hi>A. D.</hi> 1528. gave Cardinal <hi>Woolſey</hi> a Power to ſurpreſs ſeveral Monaſteries; he was to transferr all their Goods and poſſeſſions to his Collegiate Church at <hi>Windſor,</hi> and to Kings Colledge in <hi>Cambridge;</hi> and when the ſame Pope gave the ſame Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal many other Religious Houſes, it was for the endowing <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and his Colledge in <hi>Ipſwich:</hi> And to Name no more, when Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſeventh, <hi>A. D.</hi> 1655. ſuppreſſed the Order of the <hi>Fratres Cruciferi,</hi> he diſpoſed of all their Houſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, When this very Pope was attended with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſadors that came to his Confirmation, the Pope found fault with them, <q>That the Church-yards were not reſtored, <hi>ſaying</hi> that it was by no means to be tolerated, and that it was neceſſary to render all even to a Farthing, becauſe the things that belong to God, can never be applyed to humane uſes, and he that withholdeth the leaſt part of them, is in a continual ſtate of Damnation; that if he had power to grant them he would do it moſt readily, — but his Authority was not ſo large as that he might prophane the things that are dedicated to God; and let <hi>England</hi> be aſſured that this would be an <hi>Anathema, &amp;c.

               </q> p. 392. <hi>Sleidam Com.</hi> p. 779. And all this was ſaid by the Pope within four Months of the pretended Conſirmation.</p>

And this is the only probable Reaſon why in <hi>England</hi> this Bull is wholly ſuppreſs'd and loſt.</q> In Confirmation of this, it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that <hi>Cardinal Pool,</hi> notwithſtanding his Diſpenſation, carneſtly exhorted all perſons by the Bowels of Chriſt Jeſus, that not being unmindful of their Salvation, they would at leaſt out of their Eccleſiaſtical Goods take care to encreaſe the Endowments of Parſonages and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carages, that the Incumbents may be commodiouſly and honeſtly maintain'd according to their Quality and Eſtate, whereby they may laudibly exerciſe the cure of Souls, and ſupport the incumbent Burthens, and farther urg'd the Judgments that fell upon <hi>Baithazar,</hi> for convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the holy Veſſels to prophane uſes.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> who beſt underſtood what had been done, after the time of this pretended Confirmation from the pope, reſtored all the Church Lands that were then in the Crown, ſaying, <q>That they were taken away contrary to the Law of God, and of the Church, and therefore her conſcience did not ſuffer her to detain them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Ref.</hi> p. 238. So that by a new Decree he retrieved all thoſe Goods and Eccleſiaſtical Revenues which had been alienated from the Church, ſince the time of <hi>Julius</hi> the Second, <hi>Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emt</hi>'s <hi>Contin.</hi> p. 112. So improbable a ſtory is it, that this Pope confirmed theſe Alienations in <hi>England.</hi> And whereas Dr. <hi>Johnſton,</hi> p. 173. hath theſe words, Mr. Fox <hi>ſaith,</hi> 
               <q>The Pope publiſhed a Bull in print againſt the reſtoring of Abby-Lands, which Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> affirms alſo, Ap. Fol. 403.</q> It is notoriouſly falſe, they both aſſerting the contrary; Dr. <hi>Burnet's</hi> Words in that very place are theſe: <q>The Pope in plain terms refuſed to ratifie what the Cardinal had done, and ſoon after ſet out a ſevere Bull, curſing and condemning all that held any Church Lands.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly and laſtly, The ſucceeding Popes have been clearly of this opinion. Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth, who immediately ſucceeded this <hi>Paul,</hi> confirm'd the <hi>Counoil</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> and therein dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all the detainers of <hi>Church-Lands;</hi> and tho he was much importuned to confirm ſome Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enations made by the King of <hi>France</hi> to pay the debts of the Crown, yet he abſolutely refuſed it, <hi>F. Pauls H. C. Trent.</hi> 713. Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Tenth, firſt proteſted againſt the Alienations of <hi>Church Lands</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> that were made at the great Treaty of <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Oſnaburg. A. D.</hi> 1648. and when that would not do, by his Bull, <hi>Nov.</hi> 26. in the very ſame Year, damns all thoſe that ſhould dare to retain the <hi>Church-Lands,</hi> and declares the Treaty void. <hi>Infirmnentum pacis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>&amp; Innocentii</hi> 10 <hi>me declaratio nullitatis. Artic. &amp;c.</hi> and all their late Popes in the <hi>Bulla caenae</hi> do very ſolemnly, <q>Damn and Excommunicate all who uſurp any Juriſdiction, Fruits, Revenues, and Emoluments belonging to any Eccleſiaſtical perſon upon account of any Churches, Monaſteries, or other Eccleſiaſtical Benefices, or who, upon any occaſion or cauſe, Sequeſter the ſaid Revenues without the Expreſs leave of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or others, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lawful power to do it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> And tho upon <hi>Geod-Friday</hi> there is publiſhed a general Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, yet out of that are expreſly excluded all thoſe who poſſeſs any <hi>Church Lands</hi> or <hi>Goods,</hi> who are ſtill left under the ſentence of Excommunication. <hi>Toleti Inſtr. Sacerd.</hi> and his <hi>Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio caſuum in Bulla caenae Dni reſerva.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From which conſideration it's evident, that it never was the deſign of the Pope to confirm the <hi>Engliſh Church Lands</hi> to the Lay-poſſeſſors, but that he always urg'd the neceſſity of reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them to religious uſes; in order to which, the papiſts prevailed to have the ſtatute of <hi>Mortmain</hi> repealed for 20 Years. In Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign the factious party that was manag'd wholy by Romiſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Luther,</hi> lately printed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> p. 15. <hi>The Monks wrote Anathema upon the Regiſters and Donations belonging to Monaſteries; the weight and eſſect of which curſes are both felt and dreaded to this day.</hi> To this End, the <hi>Monaſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>If therefore the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> did never confirm theſe Alienations of <hi>Church-Lands,</hi> but earneſtly and ſtrictly required their Reſtitution; if they have declared in their Authentick <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,</hi> that they have no power to do it, and both they and the laſt general <hi>Council</hi> pronounce an heavy <hi>Curſe</hi> and <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt all ſuch as detain them: Then let every one that poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth theſe Lands, and yet own either of theſe Foreign Juriſdictions, conſider, that here is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left to excuſe him from Sacriledge, and therefore with his Eſtate he muſt derive a curſe to his poſterity. There is ſcarcely any Papiſt but that is forward to accuſe King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. of Sacriledge, and yet never reflects upon himſelf who quietly poſſeſſeth the Fruits of it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reſtitution, either let them not accuſe him, or elſe reſtore themſelves. Now whatever opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions the papiſts may have of theſe things in the time of health, yet I muſt deſire to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> propoſed to Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> in Doctor <hi>Pary's</hi> Days, Viz. <hi>That if he would encourage them in</hi> England, <hi>they did not doubt but that by dealing with the Conſciences of thoſe who were dying, they ſhould ſoon recover the greateſt part of the Goods of the Church.</hi> Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Hiſt. Vol. 2. p. 328. Not to mention that whenſoever the Regulars ſhall grow numerous in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and by conſequence burthenſome to the few Nobility and Gentry of that perſwaſion, they will find it neceſſary for them to conſent to a Reſtitution of their Lands, that they may ſhare the burthen among others. For ſo vaſt are the Burthens and Payments that that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion brings with it, that it will be found at length an advantagious Bargain to part with all the <hi>Church Lands</hi> to indemnifie the reſt. And I am confident that the Gentry of <hi>England</hi> that are Papiſts, have found greater Burthens and Payments ſince their Religion hath been allow'd, than ever they did for the many years it was forbid; and this charge muſt daily encreaſe ſo long as their <hi>Clergy</hi> daily grows more numerous, and their few <hi>Converts</hi> are moſt of them of the meaneſt Rank, and ſuch as want to be provided for: And that's no eaſie matter to force <hi>Converts,</hi> may appear from that Excellent Obſervation of the great Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, who told Queen <hi>Mary, That by endeavouring to compel others to his own Relegion, he had tired and ſpent himſelf in vain, and purchas'd nothing by it, but his own diſhonour.</hi> Card. <hi>Pool</hi> in <hi>Heylin</hi>'s Hiſt. Ref. p. 217. And to conclude this Diſcourſe, had the Act of Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the Third by his Legate <hi>Cardinal Pool,</hi> in confirming of the Alienation of <hi>Church Lands</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> been as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid as is by ſome pretended? yet what ſhall ſecure us from an Act of Reſumption? That very Pope after that pretended Grant to <hi>Cardinal Pool,</hi> publiſhed a Bull, in which he Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated all that kept <hi>Abby-Lands</hi> or <hi>Church Lands, Burnet's</hi> Hiſt. Vol. 2. p. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His Succeſſor, Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Fourth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieved all the Goods and Eccleſiaſtical Revenues that had been alienated from the Church, ſince the time of <hi>Julius</hi> the Second; and the chief Reaſons that are given why the Popes may not ſtill proceed to an Act of Reſumption of theſe Lands in <hi>England,</hi> amount only to this, That they may ſtay for a fair opportunity, when it may be done without diſturbing the peace of the Kingdom. From all which it's evident, that the detaining of <hi>Abby-Lands,</hi> and other <hi>Church-Lands,</hi> from the Monks and Friars, is altogether inconſiſtent with the Doctrine and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion,</p>

            <p>HIS preſent Majeſty having erected an High-Commiſſion <hi>Court</hi> to enquire of, and make redreſs in, Eccleſiaſtical Matters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Whether ſuch a <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> as the Law now ſtands, be good or not?</p>
            <p>And I hold that the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> is not good. And to maintain my Opinion herein, I ſhall, in the firſt place, briefly conſider, what Power the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>England</hi> had in Eccleſiaſtical or Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Matters (for I take them to be ſynonymous Terms) before 17 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>ca.</hi> 11. And, <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall particularly conſider the Act of 17 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>ca.</hi> 11. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>ca.</hi> 12. And by that time I have fully conſidered theſe three Acts of Parliament, it will plainly appear, that the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>England</hi> hath now no <hi>Power</hi> to erect ſuch a <hi>Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, and do agree, That by the <hi>Common Law</hi> all Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction was lodged in the Crown; and the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and all Spiritual <hi>Perſons</hi> derived their Juriſdiction from thence: And I cannot find that there were any Attempts by the Clergy to diveſt the Crown of it, till <hi>William</hi> the Firſt's Time, and his Succeſſors down to King <hi>John,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> obtained four <hi>Points</hi> of Juriſdiction. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Sending of Legates into <hi>England. Secondly,</hi> Drawing of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to the Court of <hi>Rome. Thirdly,</hi> Donation of Biſhopricks, and other Eccleſiaſtical Benefices. And <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Exemption of Clerks from the Secular <hi>Power.</hi> Which four Points were gained within the ſpace of an hundred and odd Years; but with all the Oppoſition imaginable of the Kings and their People; and the Kingdom never came to be abſolutely inſlaved to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> till King <hi>John</hi>'s Time, and then both King and People were, and ſo continued to be in a great meaſure in <hi>Henry</hi> the Third's Time; and ſo would in all likelihood have continued, had not wiſe <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt oppoſed the Pope's Uſurpation, and made the Statute of <hi>Mortmain:</hi> But that which chiefly brake the Neck of this, was, That after the Pope and Clergy had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured in <hi>Edward</hi> the Second's Time, and in the beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, to uſurp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; <hi>Edward</hi> the Third did reſiſt the Uſurpation, and made the Statutes of Proviſors, 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. and 27 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. And <hi>Richard</hi> the Second backed thoſe Acts with 16 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. <hi>ca.</hi> 5. and kept the <hi>Power</hi> in the Crown by them Laws, which being interrupted by Queen <hi>Mary</hi> (a bloody Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) during her Reign, there was an Act made in 1 <hi>Eliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi> 1. which is Intituled,

                  <hi>Keeble</hi>'s Stat.</note> 
               <hi>An Act to reſtore to the Crown the ancient Juriſdiction over the Eſtate Eccleſiaſtical and Spiritual, and aboliſhing all foreign Powers repugnant to the ſame,</hi> From which Title I collect three things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Crown had anciently a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction over the Eſtate Eccleſiaſtical and Spiritual. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That that Juriſdiction had for ſome time been at leaſt ſuſpended, and the Crown had not exerciſed it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That this Law did not introduce a new Juriſdiction, but reſtored the old; but with reſtoring the old Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Crown, gave a Power of delegating the Exerciſe of it. And as a Conſequence from the whole, that all Juriſdiction that is lodged in the Crown, is ſubject nevertheleſs to the Legiſlative Power in the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now conſider what Power this Act of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. declares to have been anciently in the Crown, and that appears from <hi>Sect.</hi> 16, 17, 18. of the ſame Act.</p>

            <p>Then <hi>Section</hi> 18.

            </p>
            <p>So that, I take it, that all manner of Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction was in the Crown by the Common Law of <hi>England,</hi> and declared to be ſo by the ſaid Act of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. and by that Act, a Power given to the Crown to aſſign Commiſſioners to exerciſe this Juriſdiction; which was accordingly done by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and a High Commiſſion Court was by her erected; which ſate and held Plea of all Cauſes, Spiritual and Eccleſiaſtical, during the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, and King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, till the 17th. Year of his Reign.</p>
            <p>Which leads me to conſider the Statute of 17 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>ca.</hi> 11. which Act recites the Title of 1 <hi>Eliz. ca.</hi> 1. and <hi>Sect.</hi> 18. of the ſame Act, and recites further, <hi>Section</hi> 2. That <hi>whereas by colour of ſome Words in the aforeſaid Branch of the ſaid Act, whereby Commiſſioners are authoriſed to execute their Commiſſion according to the Tenor and Effect of the Kings Letters Patents, and by Letters Patents grounded thereupon, the ſaid Commiſſioners have to the great and inſufferable Wrong and Oppreſſion of the Kings Subjects, uſed to Fine and Impriſon them, and to exerciſe other Authority, not belonging to Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction reſtored by that Act, and divers other great Miſchiefs and Inconveniences have alſo enſued to the Kings Subjects, by occaſion of the ſaid Branch, and Commiſſions iſſued thereupon, and the Executions thereof: Therefore for the repreſſing and preventing of the aforeſaid Abuſes, Miſchiefs and Inconveniences in time to come,</hi> (by <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. the ſaid Clauſe in the ſaid Act 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed with a <hi>Non obſtante</hi> to the ſaid Act, in theſe Words:) <hi>Be it Enacted by the Kings moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Majeſty, and the Lords and Commons in this preſent Parliament Aſſembled, and by the Authority of the ſame, That the aforeſaid Branch, Clauſe, Article or Sentence contained in the ſaid Act, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Word, Matter and thing contained in that Branch, Clauſe, Article or Sentence, ſhall from henceforth be Repealed, Annulled, Revoked, Annihilated and utterly made Void for ever; any thing in the ſaid Act to the contrary in any wiſe notwithſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. of the ſame Act, it is Enacted, That from and after the firſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> (in the ſaid Act mentioned) all ſuch Commiſſions ſhall be void, in theſe Words, <hi>And be it further Enacted, That from and after the ſaid firſt Day of</hi> Auguſt, <hi>no new Court ſhall be erected, ordained or appointed within this Realm of</hi> England, <hi>or Dominion of</hi> Wales, <hi>which ſhall or may have the like Power, Juriſdiction or Authority as the ſaid High Commiſſion Court now hath, or pretendeth to have; but that all and every ſuch Letters Patents, Commiſſions and Grants, made or to be made by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, his Heirs and Succeſſors; and all Powers and Authorities, granted or pretended, or mentioned to be granted thereby; And all Acts, Sentences, and Decrees, to be made, by virtue or Colour thereof, ſhall be utterly void, and of none effect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which Act then, the Power of Exerciſing Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction by Commiſſioners, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Broad-Seal, is ſo taken away, that it provides no ſuch Power ſhall ever for the future be Delegated by the Crown, to any Perſon or Perſons whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Let us then in the laſt place conſider, Whether the Act of 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>ca.</hi> 12 hath reſtored this Power or not?</p>
            <pb n="333" facs="tcp:48501:173"/>
            <p>And for this, I take it, that it is not reſtored by the ſaid Act, or any Clauſe in it; and to make this evident, I ſhall firſt ſet down the whole Act, and then conſider it in the ſeveral Branches of it, that relate to this Matter: The Act is Entituled,</p>

            <p>From the Title of the Act, and the Act it ſelf conſidered, I gather.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it is an Explanatory Act of the 17th. of <hi>Car.</hi> 1. as to one particular Branch of it, and not introductive of any new Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Occaſion of making it was not from any Doubt that did ariſe, VVhether the High Commiſſion Court were taken away? or whether the Crown had Power to erect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch like Court for the future, <hi>but from a Doubt that was made, that all ordinary Power of Coertion, and Proceedings in Cauſes Ecclefiaſtical was taken away, whereby Juſtice in Eccleſiaſtical Matters was
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:48501:174"/>obſtructed;</hi> and this Doubt did ariſe from a Clauſe in 17 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>ca.</hi> 11. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. herein menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to be recited in the ſaid Act of 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>ca.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That this Statute of 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>ca.</hi> 12. as appears upon the Face of it, was made to the intent the ordinary Juriſdiction which the Biſhops and other Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Perſens</hi> had always exerciſed under the Crown, might not be infringed; but not to reſtore to the Crown the power of Delegating the Exerciſe of Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction by <hi>Letters Patents</hi> to Lay perſons or any others, and as to this, nothing can be plainer, than the VVords of the Act it ſelf, <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereby</hi> 17 Car. 1. <hi>is repealed, but takes particular care to except what concerned the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion Court, or the new Erection of ſome ſuch Court by Commiſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither did the Law-makers think this Exception in that Statute of 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>ca.</hi> 12. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. to be ſufficient, but to put the Matter out of all doubt, in the Third Section of the ſame Statute, <hi>It is provided and Enacted, That neither that Act, nor any thing therein contained, ſhould extend or be conſtrued to revive, or give force to the Branch of</hi> 1 Eliz. 1. Sect. 18. <hi>but that the ſame Branch ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> ſtand abſolutely Repealed.</hi> And if ſo, then the power of the Crown to delegate the Exerciſe of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Juriſdiction is wholly taken away; for it was veſted in the Crown by 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. and taken away by 17 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>ca.</hi> 11. and is in no manner reſtored by 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2.12. or any other.</p>
            <p>But there may ariſe an Objection from the VVords in the Statute of 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>ca.</hi> 12. <hi>that</hi> ſaith, That <hi>that Act ſhall not extend to abridge or diminiſh the Kings Majeſties Supremacy in Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Matters and Affairs.</hi> VVhence ſome Men would gather, that the ſame power ſtill remains in the Crown that was in it before, 17 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>ca.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>To which Objection I give this Anſwer, That every Law is to be ſo conſtructed, that it may not be <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> and that for the Honour of the Legiſlators, King, Lords and Comment. Now I would appeal to the Gentlemen themſelves, that aſſert this Doctrine, VVhether they can ſo conſtrue the Act of 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>ca.</hi> 12. as they pretend to do, without offering Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to their own Reaſon? For when the 1 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>ca.</hi> 11. had abſolutely repealed the Branch of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. that veſted the power in the Crown of Delegating the Exerciſe of Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, and Enacts, That no ſuch Commiſſion ſhall be for the future; and the Act of 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>ca.</hi> 12. Repeals the 17 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>ca.</hi> 12. except what relates to that particular Branch, there can no more of the Kings Supremacy in Eccleſiaſtical Matters and Affairs, be ſaved by the ſaving in the 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>ca.</hi> 12. but what was left in the Crown by 17 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>ca.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>And now I hope I have ſufficiently evinced, That all the Proceedings before the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Commiſſioners are <hi>CORAM NON J<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>DICE;</hi> and therefore have ſufficient Reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, That the ſame would never have been ſet on foot by his preſent Majeſty (who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the Character of <hi>JAMES the Juſt,</hi> and hath promiſed upon his Royal VVord, That he will invade no Mans Property) had he not been adviſed thereunto by them who are better verſed in the Canons of the Church of <hi>ROME,</hi> than in the Laws that relate to the CROWN and CHURCH of <hi>ENGLAND.</hi>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am extream ſorry, that my ill health hath ſo long hindred me from Anſwering thoſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in which you ſo earneſtly deſired to know of me, what their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> thoughts are concerning the repeal of the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> and more particularlarly of that concerning the <hi>Teſt:</hi> I beg you to aſſure your ſelf, that I will deal very plainly with you in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and without reſerve, ſince you ſay that your <hi>Letters</hi> were writ by the <hi>King</hi>'s knowledge and allowance. I muſt then <hi>firſt</hi> of all aſſure you very poſitively, that their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten declared, as they did it more particularly to the Marquiſs of <hi>Albeville,</hi> His Majeſties <hi>Envoy</hi> Extraordinary to the <hi>States,</hi> that it is Their Opinion, <hi>That no Chriſtian ought to be perſecuted for his conſcience, or be ill uſed becauſe he differs from the publick and Eſtabliſhed Religion;</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, They can <hi>conſent,</hi> that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> be ſuffered to continue in their <hi>Religion,</hi> with as much Liberty as is allowed them by the <hi>States</hi> in theſe <hi>Provinces;</hi> in
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:48501:174"/>which it cannot be denied, that they enjoy a full Liberty of conſcience. And as for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, Their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> do not only conſent, but do heartily <hi>approve</hi> of their having an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Liberty, for the full exerciſe of their <hi>Religion,</hi> without any trouble or hindrance; ſo that none may be able to give them the leaſt diſturbance upon that account.</p>
            <p>And their Highneſſes are very ready, in caſe his Majeſty ſhall think fit to deſire it, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their willingneſs to concur in the ſetling and confirming this Liberty, and as far as it lies in them, they will protect and defend it, and according to the Language of Treaties, They will confirm it with their <hi>Guaranty,</hi> of which you made mention in yours.</p>
            <p>And if his Majeſty ſhall think fit further to deſire their concurrence in the repealing of the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> they are ready to give it; <hi>provided always that thoſe Laws remain ſtill in their full vigour, by which the Roman Catholicks are ſhut out of both Houſes of Parliament, and out of all publick Employments, Eccleſiaſtical, Civil and Military.</hi> As likewiſe all thoſe other Laws, which confirm the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> and which ſecures it againſt all the attempts of the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But their Highneſſes cannot agree to the repeal of the Teſt, or of thoſe other Penal Laws laſt mentioned, that tend to the ſecurity of the Proteſtant Religion; ſince the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi> receive no other prejudice from theſe, then the being excluded from Parliaments, or from publick Employments. And that by them the Proteſtant Religion is covered from all the Deſigns of the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> againſt it, or againſt the publick ſafety; and neither the Teſt nor theſe other Laws can be ſaid to carry in them any ſeverity againſt the Roman Catholicks upon account of their Conſciences: They are only proviſions qualifying men to be Members of Parliament, or to be capable of bearing Office; by which they muſt declare before God and Men, that they are for the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi> So that indeed, all this amounts to no more than a ſecuring the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> from any prejudices that it may receive from the <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their Highneſſes have thought and do ſtill think, that more than this ought not to be ask'd, or expected from them: ſince by this means, the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> and their poſterity will be for ever ſecured from all trouble in their Perſons or Eſtates, or in the Exerciſe of their <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi> and that the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> ought to be ſatisfied with this, and not to diſquiet the Kingdom becauſe they cannot be admitted to ſit in Parliament, or to be in Employments; or becauſe thoſe Laws in which the Security of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> does chiefly conſiſt, are not repealed, by which they may be put in a condition to overturn it.</p>
            <p>Their Highneſſes do alſo believe, that the Diſſenters will be fully ſatisfied when they ſhall be for ever covered from all danger of being diſturbed, or puniſhed for the free Exerciſe of their <hi>Religion,</hi> upon any ſort of pretence whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Their Highneſſes having declared themſelves ſo poſitively in theſe matters, it ſeems very plain to me, that They are far from being any hindrance to the Freeing Diſſenters from the Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Penal Laws;</hi> ſince they are ready to uſe their utmoſt endeavours for the Eſtabliſhing of it: Nor do They at all preſs the denying to the Roman Catholicks the Exerciſe of their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> provided it be managed modeſtly, and without Pomp or Oſtentation. As for my own part, I ever was and ſtill am very much againſt all thoſe, who would perſecute any <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> becauſe he differs from the publick and eſtabliſhed <hi>Religion:</hi> And I hope by the Grace of God to continue ſtill in the ſame mind; for ſince that Light with which <hi>Religion</hi> illuminates our minds, is according to my ſenſe of things, purely an effect of the Mercy of God to us, we ought then, as I think, to render to God all poſſible Thanks for his Goodneſs to us: and to have pity for thoſe who are ſtill ſhut up in Error, even as God has pitied us, and to put up moſt earneſt prayers to God, for bringing thoſe into the way of Truth, who ſtray from it, and to uſe all gentle and friendly methods for reducing them to it.</p>
            <p>But I confeſs, I could never comprehend how any that profeſs themſelves Chriſtians, and that may enjoy their <hi>Religion</hi> freely and without any diſturbance, can judge it lawful for them to go about to diſturb the Quiet of any <hi>Kingdom</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> or to overturn Conſtitutions, that ſo they themſelves may be admitted to Employments, and that thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> in which the Security and Quiet of the eſtabliſhed <hi>Religion</hi> conſiſts, ſhould be ſhaken.</p>
            <p>It is plain, that the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> is by the Grace of God, and by the <hi>Laws</hi> of the Land, enacted both by <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament;</hi> the publick and eſtabliſhed <hi>Religion,</hi> both in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that it is provided by thoſe <hi>Laws,</hi> that none can be admitted either to a place in <hi>Parliament,</hi> or to any publick Employment except thoſe that do openly declare, that they are of the Proteſtant Religion, and not Roman Catholicks; and it is alſo provided by thoſe Laws, that the Proteſtant Religion ſhall be in all time coming ſecured from the Deſigns of the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> againſt it: In all which I do not ſee, that theſe <hi>Laws</hi> contain any Severity, either againſt the Perſons or Eſtates of thoſe who cannot take thoſe <hi>Teſts,</hi> that are contrary to the <hi>Roman Catholick Religion,</hi> all the inconveniences that can redound to them from thence, is that their Perſons, their Eſtates, and even the Exerciſe of their <hi>Religion</hi> being aſſured to them, only they can have no ſhare in the Government, nor in Offices of Truſt, as long as their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:48501:175"/>do not allow them to take theſe <hi>Teſts:</hi> and they are not ſuffered to do any thing that is to the prejudice of the <hi>Reformed Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since, as I have already told you. Their Highneſſes are ready to concur with his Majeſty for the Repeal of thoſe <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> by which Men are made liable to fines or other Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>So I ſee there remains no difficulty concerning the Repealing the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> but only this, that ſome would have the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> render'd capable of all publick Truſts and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that by conſequence, all thoſe ſhould be repealed that have ſecured the Proteſtant Religion againſt the deſigns of the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> where others at the ſame time are not leſs earneſt to have thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> maintained in their full and due vigour; and think, that the chief Security of the eſtabliſhed <hi>Religion</hi> conſiſts in the preſerving of them Sacred and unſhaken.</p>
            <p>It is certain, that there is no Kingdom, Common-Wealth, or any conſtituted Body or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly whatſoever, in which there are not Laws made for the Safety thereof; and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide againſt all Attempts whatſoever, that diſturb their peace, and that preſcribe the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Qualities that they judge neceſſary for all that ſhall bear Employments in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, State or Corporation: And no man can pretend, that there is any Injury done him, that he is not admitted to Imployments when he doth not ſatisfie the Conditions and Qualities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
            <p>Nor can it be denied, that there is a great difference to be obſerved in the conduct of thoſe of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> and of the Roman Catholicks towards one another: The Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks not being ſatisfied to exclude the <hi>Reformed</hi> from all places of Profit or of Truſt, they do abſolutely ſuppreſs the whole Exerciſe of that <hi>Religion,</hi> and perſecute all that profeſs it; and this they do in all thoſe places where it is ſafe and without danger, to carry on that rigour. And I am ſorry that we have at this preſent ſo many deplorable Inſtances of this ſeverity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Eyes, that is at the ſame time put in practice in ſo many different places.</p>
            <p>I would therefore gladly ſee one ſingle good reaſon to move a Proteſtant that fears God, and that is concerned for his <hi>Religion,</hi> to conſent to the Repealing of thoſe Laws that have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by the Authority of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> which have no other tendency but to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> and to the reſtraining of the Roman Catholicks from a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of overturning it; theſe Laws inflict neither Fines nor Puniſhments, and do only exclude the Roman Catholicks from a ſhare in the Government, who by being in Employments muſt needs ſtudy to encreaſe their party, and to gain to it more Credit and Power, which by what we ſee every day, we muſt conclude, will be extreamly dangerous to the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> and muſt turn to its great prejudice: Since in all places, thoſe that are in publick Employments, do naturally Favour that <hi>Religion</hi> of which they are, either more or leſs. And who would go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to perſwade me or any man elſe to endeavour to move Their Highneſſes, whom God hath honoured ſo far as to make them the Protectors of his Church, to approve of, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to things ſo hurtful, both to the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> and to the publick Safety. Nor can I, Sir, with your good leave, in any way, grant what you apprehend, That no prejudice will thereby redound to the <hi>Reformed Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know it is commonly ſaid, that the number of the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> is very inconſiderable; and that they are poſſeſſed only of a very ſmall number of the places of Truſt: Tho even as to this, the caſe is quite different in <hi>Ireland:</hi> Yet this you muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity grant me, that if their numbers are ſmall, then it is not reaſonable that the publick Peace ſhould be diſturbed on the account of ſo few perſons, eſpecially when ſo great a favour may be offered to them; ſuch as the free Exerciſe of their <hi>Religion</hi> would be: And if their numbers are greater, then there is ſo much the more reaſon to be afraid of them; I do indeed believe that <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> as things at preſent ſtand, will not be very deſirous to be in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Offices and Imployments, nor that they will make any attempts upon the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> both becauſe this is contrary to Law, and becauſe of the great inconveniencies that this may bring at ſome other time both on their Perſons and their Eſtates: yet if the Reſtraints of the Law were once taken off, you would ſee them brought into the Government, and the chief Offices and Places of Truſt would be put in their hands, nor will it be eaſie to his <hi>Majeſty</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them in this, how ſtedfaſt ſoever he may be; for they will certainly preſs his hard in it, and they will repreſent this to the King, as a matter in which his Conſcience will be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and when they are poſſeſſed of the publick Offices, what will be left for the <hi>Protestants</hi> to do, who will find no more the ſupport of the Law, and can expect little Encouragement from ſuch Magiſtrates? And on the other hand, the advantages that the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> would find in being thus ſet looſe from all reſtraints, are ſo plain, that it were a loſs of time to go about the proving it. I neither can nor will doubt of the ſincerity of his Majeſties intentions, and that he has no other deſign before him in this matter, but that all his Subjects may enjoy in all things the ſame <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Freedom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But plain Reaſon, as well as the Experience of all Ages, the preſent as well as the paſt, ſhews, that it will be impoſſible for <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> when they are mixed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:48501:175"/>in places of Truſt and publick Employments, to live together peaceably, or to maintain a good Correſpondence together. They will be certainly always jealous of one another; For the Principles and the Maxims of both <hi>Religions</hi> are ſo oppoſite to one another, that in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion I do not ſee how it will be in the power of any Prince or King whatſoever, to keep down thoſe Suſpitions and Animoſities, which will be apt to ariſe upon all occaſions.</p>
            <p>As for that which you apprehend, that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> ſhall not be delivered from the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> that are made againſt them, unleſs at the ſame time the <hi>Teſt</hi> be likewiſe repealed: This will be indeed a great unhappineſs to them; but the Roman Catholicks are only to blame for it, who will rather be content that they and their Poſterity ſhould lie ſtill under the weight of the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> and expoſed to the hatred of the whole Nation; than he ſtill reſtrained from a capacity of attempting any thing againſt the Peace and the Security of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi> And be deprived of that ſmall advantage (if it is at all to be reckoned one) of having a ſhare in the Government and publick Enjoyments; ſince in all places of the World this has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the priviledge of the <hi>Religion</hi> that is eſtabliſhed by Laws; and indeed theſe Attempts of the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> ought to be ſo much the more ſuſpected and guarded againſt by <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in that they ſee that <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> even when liable to that Severity of <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> do yet endeavour to perſwade his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> to make the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> whether they will or not, diſſolve the Security which they have for their <hi>Religion:</hi> And to clear a way for bringing in the <hi>Roman Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>Such then will be very unjuſt to Their <hi>Highneſſes,</hi> who ſhall blame them for any inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency that may ariſe from thence; ſince they have declared themſelves ſo freely on this Subject, and that ſo much to the advantage even of the <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi> And ſince the Settlements of matters ſticks at this ſingle point, that Their Highneſſes cannot be brought to conſent to things that are ſo contrary to <hi>Laws</hi> already in being, and that are ſo dangerous and ſo hurtful to the Proteſtant Religion, as the admitting of <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> to a ſhare in the Government, and to places of Truſt, and the repealing of thoſe Laws, that can have no other effect but the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> from all the Attempts of the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> againſt it, would be.</p>
            <p>You Write, <hi>That the Roman Catholicks in theſe Provinces are not ſhut out from Employments and places of Truſt;</hi> But in this you are much miſtaken. For our Laws are expreſs, excluding them by name from all ſhare in the Government, and from all Employments either of the Policy or Juſtice of our Country. It is true, I do not know of any expreſs Law, that ſhuts them out of Military Employments; that had indeed been hard, ſince in the firſt Formation of our <hi>State</hi> they joyned with us in defending our publick Liberty, and did us eminent ſervice during the Wars; therefore they were not ſhut out from thoſe Military Employments, for the publick ſifety was no way endanger'd by this, both becauſe their numbers that ſerved in our Troops were not great, and becauſe the <hi>States</hi> could eaſily prevent any Inconvenience that might ariſe out of that; which could not have been done ſo eaſily, if the Roman Catholicks had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to a ſhare in the Government, and in the Policy or Juſtice of our <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am very certain of this, of which I could give very good proofs that there is nothing which Their Highneſſes deſire ſo much, as that his <hi>Majeſty</hi> may reign happily, and in an intire Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence with his Subjects and that his Subjects being perſwaded of his <hi>Majeſties</hi> fatherly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them, may be ready to make him all the returns of duty that are in their Power: But their Highneſſes are convinced in their Conſciences, that both the Proteſtant Religion and the ſafety of the Nation, would be expoſed to moſt certain Dangers, if either the Teſts, or thoſe other <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> of which I have made frequent mention, ſhould be repealed; <hi>Therefore they cannot conſent to this, nor concur with his Majeſties Will; for they believe they ſhould have much to Anſwer for to God, if the conſideration of any preſent advantage ſhould carry them to conſent and concur in things which they believe would be not only dangerous but miſchievous to the Proteſtant Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their Highneſſes have ever paid a moſt profound duty to his Majeſty, which they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways continue to do; for they conſider themſelves bound to it, both by the Laws of God and of Nature: But ſince the matter that is now in hand, relates not to the making of <hi>new Laws,</hi> but to the total Repealing of thoſe already made both by <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament;</hi> they do not ſee how it can be expected of them, that they ſhould conſent to ſuch a <hi>Repeal,</hi> to which they have ſo juſt an averſion, as being a thing that is contrary to the Laws and Cuſtoms of all Chriſtian <hi>States,</hi> whether <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> or <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who receive none to a ſhare in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or to publick Employments, but thoſe who profeſs the publick and eſtabliſhed <hi>Religion,</hi> and that take care to ſecure it againſt all attempts whatſoever.</p>
            <p>I do not think it neceſſary to demonſtrate to you how much their Highneſſes are devoted to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> of which they have given ſuch real Evidences as are beyond all verbal ones; and they are reſolved ſtill to continue in the ſame Duty, and Affection; or rather to encreaſe it, if that is poſſible.

            <head>Reflexions on Monſieur Fagel's Letter.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Shall endeavour to Anſwer yours as fully and briefly as poſſible.</p>
            <p n="1">1. You deſire to know whether the Letter I ſent you be truly Monſieur <hi>Fagel's</hi> or not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether their Highneſſes gave him Commiſſion to Write it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How far the Diſſenters may rely on their Highneſſes word.</p>
            <p n="4">4. What effects it has on all ſorts of People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> Roman Catholicks may be pardoned if they endeavour to make that Letter paſs for an Impoſture, it is their Intereſt ſo to do, and they are ſeldom wanting to promote that, let the methods be never ſo indirect which they are forced to make uſe of: It does indeed ſpoil many hopeful Projects of theirs. But how any Proteſtant among us can really doubt the truth of it, is ſtrange to me. Some things carry their own evidence along with them, I take this Letter to be one of that kind. I do not deſire you to believe me upon my bare affirmation that I know it to be genuine, (tho this be moſt true) but ſhall offer, my Reaſons to convince you that it cannot be otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Letter is like its Author, the matter is weighty, the Reaſoning ſolid, the Stile grave, full and clear, like that of a Lawyer: It has an Air all over, which as well ſhews the Religion and Temper of its Writer, as the Matter and Method of it do his Capacity and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now all theſe Qualities make up the Character of Monſieur <hi>Fagel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, There are the ſame grounds to believe this Letter to be M. <hi>Fagel's</hi> as there are to believe any thing you have not ſeen, <hi>Viz.</hi> The conſtant Aſſeverations of Perſons of undoubted Credit that come from <hi>Holland,</hi> who all agree in it, and aſſure us of it. M. <hi>Fagel</hi> own'd it to ſeveral Engliſh Gentlemen, and many both here and in <hi>Holland</hi> knew two Months ago that ſuch a Letter was written; a Forgery would before this time have been detected, eſpecially ſuch a one as ruines the Deſigns of the Triumphing Party.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It was written by M. <hi>Fagel</hi> in anſwer to Letters from Mr. <hi>Stewart,</hi> ſent by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties ſpecial Orders, and Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> had both an Engliſh and Latin Copy ſent him: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Engliſh Copy is not called a Tranſlation, but it is a ſort of Original: For you are not to doubt but the matter was ordered ſo, that her Royal Highneſs might peruſe it as well as his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>In the next place, you would know <hi>whether their Highneſſes gave Order to Monſieur</hi> Fagel <hi>to write it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wiſh Sir; you would take the pains to read the Letter over again, and conſider who this <hi>Monſieur Fagel</hi> is; He is Penſionary of <hi>Holland,</hi> and firſt Miniſter of State, raiſed to that Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Favour, he Anſwers Letters written to him, which are ordered by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to be Communicated to their Highneſſes, In his Anſwer, he gives an Account of their Highneſſes Opinions about the Repeal of the Penal Laws and Teſt; matters of a National Concern, and of the greateſt Importance. Now you muſt have a ſtrange Opinion of <hi>Monſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur Fagel,</hi> if you think him capable of ſo great an indiſcretion (or rather Impoſture) as to write ſuch a Letter of his own Head. The Letter it ſelf Demonſtrates, that whoever writ it is no Fool, and the Circumſtances I have marked ſhow that he is no Knave. And indeed the Subſtance of it is not new, it only repeats to his Majeſty the ſame Anſwer which the Prince and Princeſs had formerly given to his Majeſties Envoy there.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, you may leave the whole Matter to this plain Iſſue: If this Letter be a falſe one, it will be diſowned; if a true one, it will be owned. Their Highneſſes love not to do things that will not bear the Light. It is evident, they did not intend the Matter of it ſhould be a Secret, having told it to <hi>Monſieur D' Albeville,</hi> as often as he (in his diſcreet VVay) neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to do it. But how it came to be printed, I cannot inform you juſtly; however you ſhall have my Conjecture.</p>
            <p>I remember, as ſoon as it was noiſed about Town, that Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> had received a Letter of ſuch a Nature from <hi>Monſieur Fagle,</hi> care was taken, that the VVriter of the common News Letters, which are diſperſed over the Kingdom, ſhould inſert in them, that their Highneſſes had declared themſelves for the Repeal of the Teſt. This <hi>Pia Fraus</hi> might, I ſuppoſe, give occaſion to the printing of the Letter, as the VViſdom and Policy of our States-men (in putting Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> on writting ſuch Letters) had procured <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>: I ſay <hi>Letters,</hi> for <hi>Monſieur Fagel</hi> had five or ſix on that Subject, before he anſwered, ſo unwilling were they in <hi>Holland</hi> to return an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, ſince they could not give one that was pleaſing, or do any thing that looked like medling.</p>
            <p>The third thing you deſired to be ſatisfied in, is, <hi>Whether the Diſſenters may re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y on their High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes Word.</hi> I am as apt to miſtruſt Princes Promiſes, as you are. But ſhall now give you my Reaſons, why I think the Diſſenters may ſafely do it. And at the ſame time, becauſe of the Affinity of the Matter, I will tell you why I think we may all rely on their Highneſs for
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:48501:176"/>our <hi>Civil Liberties,</hi> as well as the Diſſenters may do for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience.</hi> Much of what I have to ſay is equally applicable to them both, yet becauſe I know you have had an Account of Her Royal Highneſs, better than I can give you, I ſhall for the moſt part, ſpeak only of the Prince.</p>
            <p>My firſt Reaſon is the certaineſt of all Reaſons, That it will be His Highneſſes Intereſt to ſettle Matters at Home, which only can be done by a Legal Tolleration or Comprehenſion in Matters of Religion; and by reſtoring the Civil Liberties of the Nation, ſo much invaded of late. That this will be his Intereſt is evident, if his Deſigns lye abroad, as it's certain they do. Deſigns at home and abroad at the ſame time, are ſo inconſiſtent, that we ſee his Majeſty, tho raiſed above his Fears at home by his late Victory; and invited abroad by all that can excite his Appetite for Glory, cannot reconcile them: The Truth is, one that would undertake it, is in the ſame Condition with Officers that beat their Men to make them fight, they have Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies before and behind.</p>
            <p>But you may happily object, that Princes do not always follow their true Intereſts, of which it is not difficult in this Age to give ſeveral fatal Inſtances. I anſwer, That it is to be preſumed that Princes, as well as other Men, will follow their Intereſts till the contrary appear; and if they be of an Age to have taken their Fold, and have till ſuch an Age kept firm to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, the Preſumption grows ſtrong; but if their Inclinations, the Maxims of their Families, the Impreſſions of their Education, and all their other Circumſtances to ſide with their Intereſt, and lead them the ſame way, it is hardly credible they ſhould ever quit it. Now this being the preſent Caſe, we have all the certainty that can be had in ſuch Matters.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> has above theſe 15 years given ſo great proof of his Firmneſs and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, as well as of his Capacity and Conduct in oppoſing the Grand Raviſher (I may add the Betrayers too) of Liberty and Religion, that he is deſervedly (by all impartial Men) owned to be the Head of the Proteſtant Intereſt: A Headſhip, which no Princes but the Kings of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> ſhould have, and none but they would be without it.</p>
            <p>Now one may rationally conclude, That when the Prince ſhall joyn to his preſent Poſſeſſion of this Headſhip, a more natural Title, by being in a greater Capacity to act, he will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade himſelf, nor lay aſide Deſigns and Intereſts, which ought to be the Glory of <hi>England,</hi> as they are indeed the Glory of his Family, acquired and derived to him by the Blood of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, and carried on and maintained by himſelf with ſo much Honour and Reputation.</p>
            <p>I might add here, That the Prince is a Man of a ſedate, even Temper, full of Thoughts and Reflections: one that precipitates neither in Thinking, Speaking, nor Acting; is cautious in reſolving and promiſing, but firm to his Reſolutions, and exact in obſerving his Word: Inform your ſelf, and you'll find this a part of his Character, and conclude from hence what may be preſumed from his Inclinations.</p>
            <p>Now as to the Maxims of his Family, let us compare them a little where it may be decently done.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> King broke his Faith to his Proteſtant Subjects, upon this ſingle Point of Vain glory, that he might ſhew the World he was greater than moſt of his Predeceſſors; who tho they had the ſame Inclinations, were not potent enough to purſue them effectually, as he has done to the everlaſting Infamy of his Name and Reign. The Maxims of the <hi>French</hi> Kings have been, how to outvie each other in Robbing their Neighbours, and Oppreſſing their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by Perfidiouſneſs and Cruelty. But thoſe of the Family of <hi>Orange,</hi> on the contrary, have been, to Reſcue <hi>Europe</hi> from its Oppreſſors, and maintain the Proteſtant Intereſt, by Vertue, Truth, Honour and Reſolution; knowing that ſuch Methods are as neceſſary to make Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Princes and States flouriſh, as Vice and Oppreſſion are to maintain Popiſh Government.</p>
            <p>No Popiſh Prince in <hi>Europe</hi> can pretend to have kept his Word to his Proteſtant Subjects, as the Princes of <hi>Orange</hi> have always done to their Popiſh Subjects at <hi>Orange,</hi> and elſewhere; and the Papiſts have often broke their Word to that Family, and have been and are its declared Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and tho the Princes two Great Grand-Fathers, Admiral <hi>Coligny,</hi> and Prince <hi>William,</hi> were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinated by the Authority, and with the Approbation of that whole Party, yet it cannot be made appear, that ever the Princes of that Family failed in keeping their Word, even to ſuch Enemies, or uſed their own Popiſh Subjects the worſe for it, in making diſtinction between them and their other Subjects, or influenced the States to uſe theirs ſo: I ſay the States, who a low their <hi>R. C.</hi> Subjects all the Priviledges of their other Subjects, only they are kept by a Teſt from having any ſhare in the Government, which is truly a Kindneſs done them, conſidering that ill-natured humour of deſtroying all thoſe that differ from them, which is apt to break out when that Religion is in Power.</p>

            <pb n="340" facs="tcp:48501:177"/>
            <p>The next thing I am to make good, is, That his Highneſſes Education muſt have infuſed ſuch Principles as ſide with his Intereſt: There muſt be a fatal Infection in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown, if Matters miſcarry in his Highneſſes Hands, his Veins are full of the beſt Proteſtant Blood in the VVorld. The Reformation in <hi>France</hi> grew up under the Conduct and Influence of <hi>Coligni.</hi> Prince <hi>William</hi> founded the Governmtnt of the United <hi>Netherlands</hi> on the Baſis of Property and Liberty of Conſcience, his Highneſs was bred, and lives in that State which ſubſiſts and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes by adhering ſteadily to the Maxims of its Founder.</p>
            <p>He himſelf, both in his publick and private Concerns, as well in the Government of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and of ſuch Principalities as belong to him, as in that of the Army, and in the Diſpenſing of that great Power which the States have given him, has as great regard to Juſtice, Vertue and true Religion, as may compleat the Character of a Prince, qualified to make thoſe he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns happy.</p>
            <p>It does not indeed appear, that their Highneſſes have any ſhare of that devouring Zeal which hath ſo long ſet the VVorld on Fire, and tempted thinking Men to have a Notion of Religion it ſelf, like that we have of the ancient Paradice, as if it had never been more than an interced Bleſſing, but all who have the Honour to know their Highneſſes and their Inclinations in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, are fully ſatisfied they have a truly Chriſtian Zeal, and as much as is conſiſtent with Knowledge and Charity.</p>
            <p>As to his Highneſſes Circumſtances, they will be ſuch when his Stars make way for him, as may convince our Scepticks, that certain perſons, times and things, are prepared for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I know not why we may not hope, that as his Predeceſſors broke the York of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> from off the Neck of <hi>Europe;</hi> The Honour of breaking that of the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon</hi> is reſerved for him. I am confident the Nation will heartily joyn with him in his juſt Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Reſentments which they have with ſo much Impatience long'd to find, and have miſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d with the greateſt Indignation in the Hearts of their Monarchs.</p>
            <p>His Highneſs has at preſent, a greater Influence on the Councils of the moſt part of the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> than poſſibly any King of <hi>England</hi> ever had. And this acquired <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> weight of his own perſonal Merit, which will no doubt grow up to a glorious Authority, when it is cloathed with Sovereign Power. May I here mention (to lay the Jealouſies of the moſt unreaſonable of your Friends) that his Highneſs will have only a borrowed Title, which we may ſuppoſe will make him more cautious in having Deſigns at Home, and his wanting Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (to our great Misfortune) will make him leſs ſolicitous to have ſuch Deſigns.</p>
            <p>But after all, it muſt be acknowledged, that in Matters of this Nature, the Premiſes may ſeem very ſtrong, and yet the Concluſion not follow. Humane Infirmities are great, Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Arbitrarineſs are ſtrong, and often both the Spirit and Fleſh weak. Such fatal Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes have been made of late, that the Succeſſors themſelves may juſtly pardon Mens jealouſies. A VVidow that has had a bad Husband, will cry on her VVedding-day, though ſhe would be married with all her Heart. But I am confident you will grant to me, that in the Caſe of the preſent Succeſſors, the Poſſibilities are as remote, and the Jealouſies as ill grounded, and that there is as much to ballance them, as ever there was to be found in the proſpect of any Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> Now may I add, To conclude the Reaſons that I have given you, why we may depend on their Highneſſes, that I know conſiderable Men, who after great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry and Obſervation, do hope that their Highneſſes (being every way ſo well qualified for ſuch an end) are predeſtinated (if I may ſpeak ſo) to make us happy in putting an end to our Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, and in fixing the Prerogative, and in recovering the Glory of the Nation, which is ſo much ſunk, and which now (when we were big with Expectations) we find ſacrificed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy partialities in matters of Religion.</p>
            <p>The laſt thing you deſire to know, is, <hi>What Effect this Letter has had?</hi> But it is not yet old enough for me to judge of that, I can better tell you what Effects it ought to have. I find the moderate wiſe Men of all Perſwaſions are much pleaſed with it.</p>
            <p>I know <hi>Roman Catholiks</hi> that wiſh to God Matters were ſetled on the Model given in it; they ſee the great Difficulty of getting the Teſt Repealed: And withal, they doubt whether it is their Intereſt that it ſhould be repealed or not: They fear needy violent Men might get into Employments who would put his Majeſty on doing things that might ruine them and their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. They are certainly in the right of it. It is good to provide for the worſt. A Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will come with a VVitneſs; and its like it may come before the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> be of Age to manage an unruly Spirit, that I fear will accompany it. Humane Nature can hardly digeſt what it is already neceſſitated to ſwallow, ſuch provocations even alters mens Judgments. I find that Men, who otherways hate ſeverity, begin to be of Opinion that Queen <hi>Elizabeths Lenity</hi> to the <hi>R. C's</hi> proves now Cruelty to the Proteſtants. The whole Body of Proteſtants in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was lately afraid of a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor,</hi> and when they reflected on Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Reign, thought we had already ſufficient Experience of the Spirit of that Religion; and took Self pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation to be a good Argument for preventing a ſecond Tryal. But now a handful of <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> perhaps reflecting on Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign, are not, it ſeems, afraid of <hi>Proteſtant
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:48501:177"/>Succeſſors.</hi> But if ſome <hi>Proteſtants</hi> at that time, from an Averſion to the Remedy, hop'd that the Diſeaſe was not ſo dangerous as it proves. I am confident at preſent, all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are agreed, that henceforward the Nation muſt be ſaved, not by Faith. And therefore I would adviſe the <hi>R. C's.</hi> to conſider that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are ſtill Men, that late Experiences at home, and the Cruelties of <hi>Popiſh Princes</hi> abroad, has given us a very terrible <hi>Idea</hi> of their Religion. That Opportunity is precious and very ſlippery, and if they let the preſent Occaſion paſs by, they can hardly ever hope that it will be poſſible for them to recover it. That their Fathers and Grand-fathers would have thought themſelves in Heaven to have had ſuch an Offer as this is, in any of the four laſt Reigns, and therefore, that they had better be contented with <hi>Half a Loaf, than no Bread.</hi> I mean, it will be their VViſdom to embrace this Golden Occaſion of putting themſelves on a Level with all other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, at leaſt as to their private Capacity; and to diſarm once for all, the ſeverity of thoſe Laws; which if ever they ſhould come to be in good earneſt executed by a Proteſtant Succeſſor, will make <hi>England</hi> too hot for them: And therefore I ſhould particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly adviſe thoſe among them, who have the Honour to approach his Majeſty, to uſe their Credit to prevail with him to make this ſo neceſſary a ſtep in Favour of the Nation; ſince the Succeſſors have advanced two Thirds of the way for effecting ſo good and pious a VVork. Then, and not till then, the <hi>R. C's</hi> may think themſelves ſecured, and his Majeſty may hope to be great by tranſlating Fear and Anger from the Breaſts of his Subjects, to the Hearts of his Own and the Nations Enemies.</p>
            <p>But if an evil Genius (which ſeems to have hovered over us now a long time) will have it otherwiſe; if I were a <hi>R. C.</hi> I could meddle no more, but live quiet at home, and careſs my Proteſtant Neighbours; and in ſo doing, I ſhould think my ſelf better ſecured againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments of the Nation, than by all the Forces, Forts, Leagues, Garranties, and even <hi>Men Children,</hi> that His Majeſty may hope to leave behind him.</p>
            <p>As for the Proteſtant Diſſenters, I am confident the Body of them will continue to behave themſelves like Men, who, to their great Honour have ever preferred the Love of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Religion to all Dangers and Favours whatſoever, but there are both weak and intereſted Men among all great Numbers; I would have them conſider how much the ſtate of things is altered, upon the coming out of this Letter, for if hitherto they have been too forward in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ear to Propoſals on this Miſtake, that they could never have ſuch a favorable Juncture, for getting the Laws againſt them repealed: I hope now they are undeceived, ſince the Succeſſors have pawn'd their Faith and Honour for it, which I take to be a better ſecurity (as Matters go at preſent) than the ſo much talked of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> for Liberty of Conſcience would be, tho got in a legal way, for our Judges have declared, That Princes can diſpenſe with the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Laws, but they have not yet given their Opinion, that they can diſpenſe with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their Word; nor have their Highneſſes any Confeſſor to ſupply ſuch an Omiſſion.</p>
            <p>However it is not to be charged on their Highneſſes, if ſuch a <hi>Magna Charta</hi> be not at preſent given them, provided the Teſt be let alone; but I fear the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks Zeal will have all or nothing; and the Teſt too muſt be repealed by wheedling the Diſſenters to joyn with will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sheriffs in violating the Rights of Elections, which are the Root of the Liberties of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi> prudent way of recommending their Religion to all true <hi>Engliſh Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if any of the Diſſenters be ſo deſtitute of Senſe and Honeſty, as to prefer a <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> ſo obtained, Void and Null in it ſelf, to their own Honour and Conſcience, to the Love and Liberties of their Countrey, to the preſent Kindneſs of all good Men, and their Countenance at another time, and above all, to the Favour and Word of the Succeſſors, who have now ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly declared themſelves for them: We may pronounce, that they are Men abandoned to a reprobate Sence, who will juſtly deſerve Infamy and the hatred of the Nation at preſent, and its Reſentments hereafter. Is it poſſible, that any Diſſenter, who either deſerves or loves the Reputation of an honeſt Man, can be prevailed with by any pretences of Inſinuations, how plauſible ſoever, to make ſo odious and pernicious a Bargain, as that of buying a precarious pretended Liberty of Conſcience, at the price of the Civil Liberties of their Country, and at the price of removing that, which under God, is the moſt effectual Bar to keep us from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of a Religion, that would, as ſoon as it could, force us to abandon our own, or reduce us to the miſerable Condition of thoſe of our Neighbours, who are glad to forſake all they have in the World, that they may have their Souls and Lives for a Prey.</p>
            <p>As for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> their Clergy have of late oppoſed themſelves to <hi>Popery,</hi> with ſo much Learning, Vigor, Danger and Succeſs, that I think all honeſt Diſſenters will lay down their Reſentments againſt them, and look on that Church, as the preſent Bulwark and Honour of the Proteſtant Religion. I wiſh thoſe high Men among them, who have ſo long appropriated to themſelves, the Name and Authority of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and have been made Inſtruments to bring about Deſigns, of which their preſent Behaviour convinces me, they were ignorant, as I ſuppoſe many of the Diſſenters are, whoſe turn it is now to be the Tools.</p>
            <p>I ſay, I wiſh ſuch Men would conſider, to what a paſs they have brought Matters by their Violences, or rather the Violences of theſe whoſe Property they were, and at length be wiſe;
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:48501:178"/>They cannot but be ſenſible of the Advantages they receive by this Letter. I ſuppoſe they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend (I am ſure they ought to do it) that the Ruine of their Church is reſolv'd on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> But if the Diſſenters upon this Letter withdraw themſelves, the <hi>R. C's.</hi> have neither Hearts to keep firm to ſuch a Reſolution, nor Hands to execute it.</p>
            <p>Since therefore they themſelves have unhappily brought their Church into ſuch Precepices by provoking the Diſſenters, it is in a particular manner their Duty, as well as their Intereſt, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſoften them, by aſſiſting the Letter, and promoting the Deſign of it.</p>
            <p>But if the old Leaven ſtill remain, and they continue to argue as formerly, if the Surplice be parted with, the Church of <hi>England</hi> is loſt; if the Penal Laws be repealed, the Teſt w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Sir, I thought I had made an end, but looking your Letter over again, I find I have forgot to anſwer a Reaſon or two you give, why you doubt whether the Letter be truly Mr. <hi>Fagels:</hi> You are informed (you ſay) that ſuch and ſuch Great Men doubted of it; but ſome might as well pretend to doubt of the Truth of that Letter (though they knew it to be true) as believe her Majeſty to be with Child, almoſt before ſhe knew it her ſelf; and that ſhe was quick, when the Embryo, as Anatomiſts ſay, is not much above an inch long; I don't think that Popiſh Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, like certain VVeeds, grow faſter than others: The <hi>Perſons</hi> you name may Trim, and preſume on their Merit, leaſt they might be thought capable of Reſentment. A dangerous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection. I ſay their Merit: you have ſeen a long Relation of the great Services ſome (when they were in <hi>Power</hi>) did their Highneſſes; it is bound up with a Relation of the true Cauſes of their Sufferings for their (or rather their Highneſſes) Religion. You know even how one of them the laſt Summer payed them his Reverence with all the Reſpect and Humility of a due diſtance, and with the ſame Caution with which the Invincible Monarch fights out of Canon Shot. But Sir, though the Character of a Trimmer be ordinarily the Character of a prudent Man, there are Times and Seaſons when it is not the Character of an honeſt Man.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge, that ſince their Highneſſes Marriage, nothing has hapned ſo much for the Good of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Intereſt as this Letter of Mr. <hi>Fagels,</hi> and if I had been either the Writer or Adviſer of it, I ſhould be very proud of it, and think the Nation much in my Debt. But Sir, that was not a very good Reaſon to make you doubt of it, for a good Cauſe will have its time, though not ſo often as a bad one, which hath ordinarily the Majority of its ſide.</p>
            <p>I am confident at preſent we have all the reaſon in the World to expect it, for my own part, though I am neither young nor ſtrong, I hope to live to ſee a Day of Jubilee in <hi>England</hi> for all that deſerve it; when honeſt Men ſhall have the ſame <hi>Pleaſure</hi> in thinking on theſe Times, that a Woman happily delivered hath in reflecting on the <hi>Pain</hi> and Danger ſhe was in. But Knaves ſhall remember them, as I am told, the damned do their Sins, Curſing both them and themſelves:</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have been ſo far hitherto from thinking, that the pretended <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Letter</hi> of <hi>Mijn Heer Fagel</hi> deſerved a Reply, that I judged it would have been a diſgrace offered to the Judgment of perſons of the moſt ordinary Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, as well as the Witneſſing not only a great meaſure of ſelf-denial, but the ſubmitting of my ſelf to a ſevere mortification and pennance, to beſtow one upon it. For as it argues a mean Opinion of mankind, to believe that they ſhould need any aſſiſtance, ſave what their own Reaſon furniſheth them with, in order to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation from being impoſed upon, by ſo weak, fooliſh, incoherent and ſelf-contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictious a Paper; ſo 'tis both the rendring one mean and cheap, and the inflicting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf a moſt uneaſie chaſtiſement, to waſte his time and employ his thoughts in animadverting upon, and expoſing ſo trifling and deſpicable an Author. But ſeeing I am told, that not only he who is commonly ſuppoſed to have had the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and indiſcretion to write the <hi>Anſwer,</hi> has alſo the vanity to value himſelf upon it; but that there are others, whoſe wit, candour, and ingenuity are much of a ſize with his, who do improve our ſilence in reference unto it, tho' ariſing from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and neglect which all wiſe men have for it, to countenance themſelves in a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and to obtrude an Opinion upon others, of its containing ſomething nervous and conſiderable; I ſhall therefore account my ſelf for once, ſo much a debtor both to the vain, and to the unwiſe, as to beſtow a few ſuch Reflections upon it, as may ſerve to rectifie the Judgments of the one, and both to correct the folly, and to abate the pride and ſwelling confidence of the other. And indeed the Author's concealing his Name, may make us juſtly ſuſpect, that we are not to look for truth, ſtrength, nor candor in that Paper, eſpecially when he writes not only in Juſtification of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of his Majeſty of Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> which is enough to ſhield him from all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Attacks, provided that he had conducted himſelf as became a wiſe and an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man: But in that he enters the liſts againſt a perſon of <hi>Mijn Heer Fagel</hi>'s quality, and whoſe Letter not only had his Name affixed to it, and was beautified with all thoſe impreſſions of clearneſs, gravity, ſtrength, prudence and Religion, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the greatneſs of the Subject, and whereunto the having been able to return an Anſwer, that had the umbrage and appearance of Reaſon, would have given a reputation to the Undertaker; but which had been alſo penned by the Command and Authority of their Serene Highneſſes the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Princeſs</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> in order to declare their Opinion in a matter of the greateſt importance that ever Engliſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants were concerned in, and from Principles of Conſcience and Juſtice hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that aſſurance and ſatisfaction, which all peaceable and good men either ſtood in need of, or could deſire. And as this Authors venturing abroad in the faſhion of an <hi>Incognito,</hi> was not without reaſon, ſeeing he might thereby hope not only to treat <hi>Mijn Heer Fagel</hi> without regard to truth or ingenuity, but that with the leſs hazard both to his perſon and reputation, he might arraign the Juſtice and Fidelity of theſe States, and charge them with a violation of the Fundamental Articles, upon which their Government was at firſt erected; ſo he muſt not take it amiſs, if upon encountring him in the dark, I not only fail in paying him the deference which he may conceive due unto him, but handle him unſuitably to the Poſt he is ſaid to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs. Tho' I am not without apprehenſion, that if he bear the Character which is vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly aſcribed to him; and if the greateſt indication of the wiſdom and integrity of Princes, be the prudence and ſincerity of their Miniſters, but that we may thence come under a neceſſity of entertaining meaner thoughts than we otherwiſe would, both of the Moral and Intellectual Capacity of him, to whom this Gentleman is indebred both for his Titles, and the Function he is exalted unto. Whereas on the other hand, beſides many ſignal Evidences, which have filled all Europe with admiration of the admirable Wiſdom, inflexible Integrity, eminent Vertues, Religious tho' calm and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Zeal, and ſteddy and impartial Juſtice of his Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> our Ideas of him as a perſon under whoſe Government, Conduct and Shadow all good men may promiſe themſelves happineſs, are not a little heightned by the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the excellent Qualities of <hi>Monſieur Fagel,</hi> whoſe advancement as <hi>Penſionary</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> to the firſt Miniſtry in that State, is owing to the <hi>Princes</hi> Grace and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation. Which Eminent Truſt, as he hath all along diſcharged with Honour to his <hi>Highneſs,</hi> Reputation to himſelf, and to the Satisfaction of thoſe who are inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:48501:179"/>in the Affairs of that Republick; ſo by nothing hath he more merited an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal eſteem and praiſe from all Proteſtants, and acquitted himſelf more worthily towards God and their Serene <hi>Highneſſes,</hi> than by that <hi>Letter</hi> wherein he was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured to declare their thoughts, and in which he hath with ſo much wiſdom, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and convincing light, expreſſed both their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> Sentiments, and his own, as well concerning the Engliſh Laws, the Papiſts may, and the Diſſenters ought to be favoured with the Repeal of, as concerning thoſe, which no wiſe Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt deſires to have reſcinded, and which to humour the Papiſts with the Abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of, were no leſs than to expoſe the Nation to ruine, and to lay the Reformed Religion open to be totally ſubverted.</p>
            <p>Now this Excellent <hi>Letter,</hi> and which hath produced all the good Effects that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men long'd for, but knew not before how to compaſs, our <hi>Anonymous</hi> Anſwerer is pleaſed with an Indignation and angry Reſentment, and in hopes to exaſperate his Majeſty of Great <hi>Britain</hi> againſt their Serene Highneſſes, to ſtile <hi>a kind of Manifeſt in reference to moſt important Affairs, which even Mr. Stewart,</hi> who in obedience to the injunctions of his Soveraign, had with ſo much importunity ſollicited their Highneſſes Opinion about the Repeal of the Penal and Teſt Laws, he ſays, <hi>could not have expected.</hi> And of whom to teſtifie his exact and intimate knowledge, and to recompence him for the unfortunate ſervice he had been employed in, and to encourage his readineſs to future drudgery, he is pleaſed by a creation of his own, as being the Subſtitute of the Fountain of Honour, to confer the Title of <hi>Dr.</hi> upon. But certainly had this <hi>Anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi> Writer the ſenſe and prudence of an ordinary man, he would not under the preſent conjuncture of Affairs, talk of <hi>Manifeſts,</hi> nor put people in mind of them at a ſeaſon, when moſt perſons of all ranks and qualities are ſo much diſguſted, and when they at <hi>Whitehall</hi> are ſo laviſh in their provocations towards <hi>ſome,</hi> who if they were not ſtrangely fortified againſt all tincture of Reſentment, are known to be capable of doing them irreparable prejudice, and who by ſuch a <hi>Manifeſt</hi> as there is cauſe enough to emit, might not only diſturb their proceedings, but with the greateſt facility blow up at once both all their hopes and projections. I would fain know of this modeſt and diſcreet Gentleman, whether if their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> had ordered a Letter to be written, declarative of their Opinion for the Abrogation of the <hi>Teſts,</hi> by what name he would have judged it worthy to be called, and whether if he had beſtowed upon it the Title of a <hi>Manifeſt,</hi> he would have thereby intended to faſten upon it an imputation of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and reproach? All good men have reaſon mightily to bewail their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> condition, ſeeing according to this rate of proceeding towards them, it is in the power of the Papal Eccleſiaſticks in <hi>England,</hi> when they pleaſe, to prevail upon the <hi>King</hi> to reduce them to the uneaſie circumſtances, either of offending againſt their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or of diſpleaſing him. For there is no more requiſite towards the bringing them into this unhappy <hi>Dilemma,</hi> but that <hi>Father Peters,</hi> or any other of the Tribe who have an Aſcendency over his Majeſty, do perſuade him to deſire their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> Thoughts, in reference to ſuch particulars, wherein it is neither conſiſtent with their Religious Principles, nor agreeable with their Honour, to comply with his Majeſties Judgment and Inclinations. For if in prudence they decline the returning of an Anſwer, they are ſure not only to be cenſured, as guilty of neglect, incivility and rudeneſs, but they do thereby adminiſter an advantage to their Enemies, of diffuſing reports to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice thro' the Nation, as if they approved all thoſe Court-methods, which for no other reaſon, ſave upon the meer motives of reſpect and wiſdom, they avoided openly to diſallow. And if on the other hand, they ſuffer themſelves to be overcome by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, and thereupon give an Anſwer agreeable to the Dictates of their own minds, but which is found to interfere with the prepoſſeſſions wherewith his Majeſty is imbued, then their Lot is, to have it called by the unkind and ignominious Title of a <hi>Manifeſt.</hi> One would think that <hi>Letter</hi> ought to have been mentioned by a ſofter name, if we do but conſider its being written not only with the utmoſt modeſty that becomes the Relation Their Highneſſes ſtand in to the King, and which is any ways agreeable to their own quality, but that it is enforced with all the Reaſons, that may ſerve to demonſtrate that their Opinion is the reſult of conviction and judgment, and not the effect of humour, nor a ſentiment they are meerly determined unto by their intereſt. But we ſee no Term is too hard to be beſtowed upon a Paper that hath ſo much prejudiced the Prieſts in their deſigns, and laid ſo great an obſtruction in the way of thoſe methods, which they had propoſed to themſelves, for the robbing <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> of the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
            <p>And whereas our Author tells us, that tho' <hi>Mr. Stewart did not account himſelf obliged to anſwer Monſieur</hi> Fagel's <hi>Letter yet one who extreamly eſteems and honoureth Mr.</hi> Stewart, <hi>thinks the Publick too much concerned, not to have the weakneſs of the reaſonings in it detected,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:48501:179"/>and to have it made appear that the inferences deduced from them are no ways convincing.</hi> I can eaſily believe that Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> did not judge himſelf obliged to anſwer the <hi>Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi>'s <hi>Letter,</hi> and all men do account it a piece of wiſdom in him to forbear endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring it. For tho' he be much better qualified for ſuch an undertaking than our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, yet he could not but be ſenſible that it was not to be attempted with any hope of ſucceſs. And if our Author had been endow'd with any meaſure of diſcretion, he would have applied himſelf to any other Employment, rather than have betaken him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to writing, being a thing which Nature never intended him for, and eſpecially upon a Subject ſo far above the reach of his underſtanding, and againſt a diſcourſe of that ſolid and well-digeſted ſtrength, that even the Reverend Fathers, whoſe <hi>Letter-carrier</hi> he uſed to be (if we be not ſtrangely miſtaken in the Gentleman) had ſo much wit as not to attack it. As knowing that notwithſtanding all their Art in Sophiſtry, they muſt have come off baffled; and that their falſe colours would have been eaſily detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the beams of that light, which dart themſelves forth in all the parts of that excellent Paper. And I dare farther ſay, that as Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> will never much value himſelf, upon the being eſteemed by one either of this Gentleman's Religious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or of his intellectual Accompliſhments; ſo I can never think that he can be ſo much degenerated from what he formerly was, as to obtain the approbation of his mind, to return any conſiderable degree of honour to a perſon who upon all accounts does ſo little merit it, unleſs it be that he may poſſibly challenge it by vertue of an undeſerved Title, and of a Character that he is exceeding ill qualified for.</p>
            <p>However, ſeeing Fools will be medling, tho' they are ſure to come by the worſt, I ſhall reduce all I have to ſay in Caſtigation of this vain and preſumptuous man, to the <hi>ſeven</hi> following heads. (1.) His Falſifications in reference to ſeveral parts of <hi>Mijn Heer Fagel's Letter.</hi> (2.) His Injuſtice to Their Highneſſes the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Princeſs</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the hidden ſpleen he every where ventureth to expreſs againſt them. (3.) His ſlanderous Calumnies againſt the States of theſe Provinces, and how he ſtudies to excite their Roman Catholick Subjects to diſturb the Peace and Tranquillity of this Country. (4) His Shameleſs Impudence in endeavouring to impoſe upon the World, as if the Proteſtant Diſſenters in <hi>England,</hi> were concluded by Their Highneſſes to ſtand hereafter involved in the ſame rank and condition with the Papiſts. (4.) His Publiſhing the Villany of the Romiſh Church, and proclaiming the Injuſtice and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of the moſt Eminent Papal Monarchs, while he pretends to commend and juſtifie the proceeding of his Majeſty of Great <hi>Brittain.</hi> (6.) His egregious Ignorance in relation to Government, Laws, Cuſtoms, and matters of Fact. <hi>(Laſtly)</hi> The ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ingratitude of the Papiſts towards Their Royal Highneſſes for all that Grace, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Eaſe, which they were willing to have allowed unto them.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>firſt,</hi> 'Tis known to be a received Principle among the <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> of the <hi>Society,</hi> that it is at moſt but a venial ſin, to detract from, miſrepreſent, and calumniate thoſe whom they either take to be their Enemies, or do conceive to have done them any ways a prejudice. And tho' the Opinion authoriſing ſuch a practice, be condemned by a <hi>Bull</hi> of the preſent <hi>Pope</hi> bearing date <hi>Anno</hi> 1679 yet our Author is more a Vaſſal to the <hi>Ignatian Order,</hi> than upon the Authority of one whom the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> do ſo little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, to forbear putting a Doctrine into exerciſe, which he hath been ſo well inſtructed in by theſe Reverend Fathers, and eſpecially when he finds it ſo conduceable to his deſign and intereſt. What can be remoter from Truth as well as Ingenuity, than to charge <hi>Monſieur Fagel with confining the name of Proteſtants in</hi> England, <hi>only to thoſe of the Conformable Communion, and with excluding the Diſſenters from the glorious priviledge of that appellation?</hi> For tho' it be true, that thro' the hatred and violence of the late King and his preſent Majeſty to the Fanaticks, and by vertue of their Commands to a Company of Mercenary, timorous and ſervile Juſticiaries and Officers it hath ſome time come to paſs that the Laws which were originally enacted, and only intended againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> have been executed upon <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> yet all men know that to have been a perverſion of Juſtice, ſeeing in all the Statutes to the Penalties whereof they were made obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, they are ſtill conſidered and acknowledged for <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and made liable to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings by no other Title than that of perſons differing from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in matter of <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and about <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Rites</hi> of External Worſhip. Nor is there one word in <hi>Mijn Heer Fagel</hi>'s Letter, whereby they are precluded from that ſtile, or any ways repreſented as unworthy of it. While they ſtand obnoxious to ſeveral Laws, in which the Members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> have no concernment, nor are in any danger from; it was impoſſible to avoid the giving them a name by which they might be diſtinguiſhed from thoſe of the Legal and National Communion. And ſo tender hath the <hi>Penſionary</hi> been of charactering them by any offenſive or harſh denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that he hath not ſo much as once in his whole Letter called them <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> tho'
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:48501:180"/>it be an appellation that hath been vulgarly affixed to them; but he hath choſen always to denominate them by the name of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> which is not only the ſofteſt Term they can be deſcribed by, but that which themſelves have elected as the ſtile by which they are willing to be diſcriminated from their fellow Proteſtants, with whom they differ in ſome few and little particulars. And many of them being people, whoſe Principles are coincident and agreeable with theirs of the Legal Eſtabliſhment in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in whoſe Fellowſhip <hi>Monſieur Fagel</hi> is known to be; it could not have entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the thoughts of any ſave one of our Authors Intellectuals and Integrity, either to charge upon him or ſo much as to imagine, that he ſhould be ſo injurious to himſelf and to the Dutch Churches, as to preclude thoſe from the liſt of Proteſtants. But whether this calumnious charge and falſification, be the fruit of an Iriſh Underſtanding, or of Papal Sincerity, or the effect of both, I ſhall leave others to judge, who may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly know this Author, better than I pretend to do. Only this I ſhall add, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds with the ſame wit and honeſty as he hath begun. For from Their Highneſſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that they cannot agree to the Repeal of the <hi>Teſts,</hi> and <hi>Monſieur Fagel</hi>'s there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſaying, that theſe Laws inflict not any mulct or penalty upon the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, but that they are only means of ſecuring the Reformed Religion, thro' contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proviſions by which men are to be accounted qualified for Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to bear publick Offices; our Author does by a ſtrange kind of falſification and calumny, faſten upon him his having affirmed. <hi>That the Non-conformiſts are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted dangerous Enemies of the State, and not to be admitted into any Publick Employments.</hi> He muſt either be of a very unuſual and perverſe frame of mind, or extreamly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the nature of thoſe Laws, and the Terms wherein they are enacted, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways it is impoſſible he ſhould imagine how the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are capable of receiving pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice by them. Seeing all required by thoſe Laws toward the qualifying perſons to ſit in Parliament, and to exerciſe Offices in Church and State, is only to declare that they <hi>do believe there is not any Tranſubſtantiation in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, or in the Elements of Bread and Wine, at or after the Conſecration by any perſons whatſoever; and that the Invocation of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>or any other Saint; and the Sacrifice of the Maſs, as they are now uſed in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>are Superſtitious and Idolatrous.</hi> And this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration the Non-conformiſts are of all people, the moſt inclinable and forward to make, and therefore very far by vertue of thoſe Statutes from ſtanding incapable of any Truſt, Office, and Employment, that other Subjects are admitted unto. Nor hath there been a Proteſtant Diſſenter ſince the firſt hour that theſe Laws were enacted, that ever ſcrupled to take the <hi>Teſts,</hi> or that was precluded from Office and Employment for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing them. But on the contrary, ſeveral of the moſt famous Diſſenters, ſuch as Sir <hi>John Hartop,</hi> Alderman <hi>Love,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Eyles,</hi> perſons who at all times have kept at the greateſt diſtance from Communion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by reaſon of her Forms and Ceremonies, are known to have chearfully made the Declaration contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Teſt</hi> Laws, and thereupon to have ſit as Members in divers Parliaments. And as a further demonſtration of the impudence and diſhoneſty of our Author in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, it is not unworthy of remark, that tho' the King hath taken upon him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with the <hi>Teſts,</hi> and to prohibit the requiring them; yet the Diſſenters, who have ſince that time, been preferred to publick Truſts, continue ſtill to take them, and go to the reſpective Courts, where by Law the Declaration is enjoined to be exacted, and there demand the being admitted to make it. Tho' in the mean ſeaſon they cannot be unſenſible, that it is the thing in the World whereby they moſt highly offend his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; it being both a proclaiming the Illegality of that Authority which he challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of diſpenſing with Laws; and a defeating, ſo far as lieth in them, his great deſign as well as artifice, for the introducing of Popery, which his Soul is ſo much in travel with. And were not this Author both a perſon of a moſt depraved Conſcience, and deſtitute of all common ſenſe, he would never have ſlandered <hi>Monſieur Fagel,</hi> and ſo egregiouſly perverted his plain meaning, as to tell us, that tho' he be a <hi>Hollander and a Non-conformiſt, yet he thanks God for the Teſt Laws, by which his Non-conforming Brethren in</hi> England, <hi>of what degree and quality ſoever they be, ſtand excluded from Publick Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> For every one that will be ſo kind to himſelf, and ſo juſt to the <hi>Penſionary,</hi> as to read his Letter, will immediately diſcern that there is not one word in it, upon which to ſuperſtruct this calumny and accuſation; ſeeing he therein affirms in repeated and emphatical Terms, that all contained in, and deſigned by the <hi>Teſt</hi> Laws, is <hi>the ſecuring the Reformed Religion, thro' the having provided, that none be allowed to ſit in Parliament, nor admitted to Publick Offices, except they declare that they are of the Reformed, and not of the Roman Catholick Religion.</hi> So that how <hi>Monſieur Fagel</hi>'s <hi>Non-conformity Brethren in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, ſhould come to be affected by theſe Laws ſo as to receive any prejudice by them, is that which none but a perſon of our Author's wit, integrity and candor, could have had the faculty either to conceive or alledge.</p>
            <pb n="347" facs="tcp:48501:180"/>
            <p>But that we may come to the <hi>ſecond particular;</hi> there is the leſs reaſon to wonder at this Gentleman's calumniating <hi>Mijn Heer Fagel,</hi> and affixing dull, tho' malicious For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries of his own unto him, if we do but conſider-with what petulancy and injuſtice he treats Their <hi>Serene Highneſſes,</hi> and at the gate of their own Court aſſumeth the confidence to miſrepreſent, leſſen and aſperſe them. The nearneſs which thoſe Princes ſtand in to the aſcending the Engliſh Throne, and the joyful proſpect which all Proteſtants have of it, exciteth a diſcontent and rage in our Author, which he knows not how either to ſuppreſs or govern. For not to mention what we learn of the kindneſs of Roman Catholicks to an Heir, profeſſing the Reformed Religion, from the proceedings of <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> and the Papiſts in <hi>France</hi> towards <hi>Henry</hi> 4. we are ſufficiently inſtructed what good will they bear to a Proteſtant Succeſſor, by the Bull which <hi>Clement</hi> 8. publiſhed about the End of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign. For the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream and Infallible Head does therein ordain, <hi>That when it ſhould happen to that miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Woman to die, they ſhould admit none to the Crown, quantumque propinquitate ſanguinis niterentur, niſi ejuſmodi eſſent qui fidem Catholicam non modo tolerarent, ſed omni ope ac ſtudio promoverent, &amp; more majorum jurejurando ſe id praeſtituros ſuſciperent; whatſoever Right and Title they ſhould have thereunto, by vertue of their next affinity in blood, unleſs they ſhould firſt ſwear not only to tolerate, but to advance and eſtabliſh the Romiſh Religion.</hi> Nor can I avoid being filled with fear and reverence to the ſafety of ſome certain perſons, when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi> commends <hi>Irene</hi> for murdering the Emperor her Son, becauſe he was againſt the Worſhip of Images, and not only calls it <hi>Juſtitiae zelum, a righteous zeal</hi> but adds, <hi>Chriſtum docuiſſe, ſummum pietatis genus eſſe in hoc adverſus filium eſſe fidelem, That Chriſt hath taught the perfiction of Religion in ſuch a caſe to conſiſt in fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to the Church, tho' by deſtroying one that was both her Son and her Soveraign.</hi> 'Tis a high piece of injuſtice in our Author towards Their <hi>Highneſſes,</hi> and calculated for no other end but to alienate his Majeſties affections from them, when he tells us, that <hi>the thing aimed at in the writing of the Penſionary's Letter, as well as that purſued in the manner of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing it, was to obſtruct the King's righteous &amp; pious deſigns, and to render them unpracticable.</hi> For the Letter being written in obedience to the Command of Their <hi>Highneſſes,</hi> &amp; to declare their Opinion in reference to the ſeveral matters, about which it treateth; it plainly follows that tho' <hi>Mijn Heer Fagel</hi> be accountable for the manner of cloathing and delivering their thoughts, and for the Order and Method in which things are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, and poſſibly for the ratiocinations by which they are ſupported and enforced, yet that the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Princeſs</hi> are the perſons who are alone reſponſible for the End unto which it was intended. And it appears to have been ſo far from their intentions, thereby to obſtruct and defeat any pious and juſt deſigns of his Majeſty; that nothing can be more viſible, than that as it is admirably adapted to the giving eaſe and ſecurity to all his Proteſtant Subjects, ſo it offereth means for relieving the Papiſts from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Laws to which they are liable, and for the granting them a Warranty in a legal way for the exerciſe of their Religion. Nor doth it diſcourage any kind of favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, ſave that which the conceſſion whereof, would not only be inconſiſtent with the peace and ſafety of thoſe of the Reformed Religion in <hi>England,</hi> but which might enflame the Nation to ſuch Reſentments, as would in all likelihood both endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger his Majeſties Perſon and Crown, and come at laſt to iſſue in the reducement of the Roman Catholicks to worſe circumſtances, than they have hitherto been acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with. But to proceed with our Author, to whom it is ſo natural to act fooliſhly, and with ſaucineſs and injuſtice, that neither the Character he is ſaid to bear, nor the Quality of the Perſons of whom he ſpeaks, can either reſtrain his intemperance, or correct his rudeneſs and indiſcretion. For <hi>Monſieur Fagel</hi> having ſaid, that he believes there are many Roman Catholicks, who under the preſent ſtate of Affairs, will not be very deſirous to be in Publick Offices and Employments, nor uſe any attempts againſt thoſe of the Reformed Religion; and that not only becauſe they know it to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law, but leſt it ſhould at ſome other time, prove prejudicial to their Perſons and States. Our Author is ſo unjuſt as well as imprudent, as to call this <hi>a menacing not only of all the Non-conformiſts and Roman Catholicks in</hi> England, <hi>but a threatning of his Majeſty, and an inſulting over him:</hi> And from thence he takes occaſion to add, <hi>that he hopes God will inable his Majeſty to repreſs and prevent the effects of theſe menaces, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him with means of mortifying thoſe who do thus threaten and inſult over him.</hi> It certainly argues a ſtrange weakneſs and diſtemper of mind, to call ſo modeſt and ſoft an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, both a <hi>menacing of the King and of all his Catholick Subjects,</hi> when I dare ſay, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimeth the ſenſe of all among the Papiſts who are endowed with any meaſure of Wiſdom, and is nothing elſe ſave a Declaration of the meaſure, by which they do at this day regulate and conduct themſelves. But the injuſtice of our Author towards Their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> in his Reflections upon the forementioned expreſſion of the <hi>Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary's,</hi>
               <pb n="348" facs="tcp:48501:181"/>is his intending them by the perſons that do threaten his Majeſty and inſult o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him. For did he take <hi>Mijn Heer Fagel</hi> for the only guilty perſon in reference to this Phraſe which he miſcalls a <hi>Menace,</hi> it would be a ſtrange detracting in him from the Power and Glory of his Majeſty of Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> to wiſh him ſufficient means whereby to ſhun the effects of a Gentleman's threatning, whoſe higheſt Figure in the World is meerly to be a Miniſter in a Republick. Nor would he bring down his Maſter to ſo low a level, as to make it the higheſt Object of his Hopes, concerning ſo great a Monarch, that he ſhall be able to <hi>mortifie</hi> a perſon, who whatſoever his Merit be, yet his Fortune is to fill no ſublimer a <hi>Poſt.</hi> So that it can be no other ſave the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Princeſs,</hi> whom our Author in his uſual way of injuſtice, petulancy and indiſcretion does here character, repreſent and intend. And what he thereupon means by the <hi>Kings having power in his hands, and by his hoping that God would furniſh him with means by which he may mortifie them,</hi> is not a matter of difficult penetration, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by perſons of the moſt ordinary capacities. For the ſeveral methods that have been projected, and are ſtill carrying on, for the debarring them from the Succeſſion to the Imperial Crowns of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to which they have ſo Juſt and Hereditary a Right, are ſufficient to detect unto us what our Author intends, and ſerve as a Key whereby to open the ſcope, and meaning of his Expreſſions. But whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Papal and Jeſuitick Endeavours may be, for the obſtructing and preventing their Aſcending the Thrones of Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> I dare ſay that all the effects they will have, will be only the diſcovering the folly and malice of thoſe that attempt it, and that they can never be able to compaſs and accompliſh it. For as their Highneſſes have both that intereſt in the Love and Veneration of all Proteſtants, and ſo indiſputable a Title, that it is impoſſible they ſhould be precluded either by <hi>Force,</hi> or in a way to which their Enemies may affix the Name of <hi>Legal;</hi> ſo there is no great cauſe to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend or fear, their being ſupplanted by their King's having Male Iſſue of a vigour to live, conſidering both his Majeſties condition and the Queens, which is ſuch that they can never communicate <hi>bona ſtamina vitae.</hi> And for the Papiſts being able to <hi>Banter</hi> a ſuppoſitious Brat upon the Nation, (tho' there are many among them villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous enough to attempt it) we have not only the watchfulneſs of Divine Providence to rely upon for preventing it, but there are many faithful and waking Eyes that will be ready and induſtrious to diſcover the Cheat. And if the People once perceive, that there hath been a contrivance carried on for putting ſo baſe an affront upon a noble and generous Kingdom, and of committing ſo horrid a wrong againſt ſuch Vertuous and Excellent Princes; I do not know but that their Reſentment of it may riſe ſo high, as that all who are diſcovered to have been acceſſory unto it, may undergo the like fate that they of old did, who were found to have been conſcious and contributory unto the thruſting the Eunuch <hi>Smerdis</hi> into the <hi>Perſian</hi> Throne. Nor do I in the leaſt doubt but that the ſame Righteous, Wiſe and Merciful God, who prevented the like villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny when deſigned in the time of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and which was advanced ſo far, that ſome Prieſts had the wickedneſs and impudence, both to give thanks in the publick Churches for her Majeſties ſafe delivery of a Prince, and alſo to deſcribe the Beauty and Features of the <hi>Babe,</hi> tho' all ſhe had gone with amounted only to a <hi>Tympany</hi> of Wind and Water; I ſay that I do not queſtion, but that the ſame God will out of his Immenſe Grace and Sapience, find ways and methods, of which there are many within the compaſs of his Infinite Underſtanding, by which ſo helliſh a piece of villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, if there be any ſuch projected and promoting, may be brought into light and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed. And truly when I conſider the Chriſtian and Royal Vertues wherewith their Highneſſes are imbued, and how they are furniſhed, with all the Moral, Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual and Religious accompliſhments, that are requiſite for adapting them to weild Scepters, and which render them not only ſo agreeable to the neceſſities and deſires of all good people, but ſo admirably qualified to anſwer both the preſent poſture of Affairs in <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Exigencies of thoſe that are oppreſſed and afflicted; I grow into a confidence, that as the Church of God both in <hi>Brittain</hi> and elſewhere, and the circumſtances in which ſo many Countreys are involved, do beſpeak and crave their Exaltation to the Thrones of the Brittiſh Dominions, ſo that they are both deſtined of God unto them, and will in due time be ſafely conducted thither. Nor can I avoid pleaſing my ſelf with thoſe joyful and hopeful thoughts, when I reflect upon the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſteps of Divine Providence, by which they are brought into that nearneſs of legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inheriting theſe Crowns. Certainly there is a voice that ſpeaketh loud to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, not only in Gods denying a Legitimate Iſſue to the Late King, and in his taking away from time to time all the Lawful Male Off-ſpring of his preſent Majeſty, but in the uniting their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> in Marriage, even to the croſſing a certain Perſons Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, whom I forbear to Name, as well as to the diſguſting of a Neighbouring Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:48501:181"/>and to the defeating the buſie endeavours of the Popiſh Party. But I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to our Author, whoſe Injuſtice to their <hi>Highneſſes,</hi> and his malice againſt their Honour, Intereſt and Reputation, knows neither end nor bounds. For upon <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Fagel</hi>'s having ask'd, Who would go about to adviſe him or any man elſe, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to perſwade their <hi>Highneſſes,</hi> whom God has ſo far honoured, as to make them, Defenders of his Church, to approve and promote things ſo dangerous and hurtful both to the Reformed Religion, and to the publick ſafety, as the Repealing of the <hi>Test</hi> Laws would be; our Author does hereupon, with his wonted Friendſhip, Equity, and Candor to thoſe Excellent <hi>Princes,</hi> tells us that <hi>he hath not met with ſo bold a Declaration as this of calling them the Protectors of Gods Church, and that the aſcribing it to them, is a detracting from the Honour of Kings and Monarchs, who will not Abdicate from themſelves to any other ſo glorious a Title.</hi> And in purſuance of his rancour towards their <hi>Highneſſes,</hi> he runs out in his way of Wit and Learning into a moſt ſilly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Diſcourſe about the Nature of a Church, and accuſeth the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,</hi> as if by having this Character conferred upon them, they had a deſign to uſurp from his Majeſty of Great <hi>Brittain</hi> the ſtile of Defenders of the Faith, and to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to themſelves <hi>the being the Protectors of the Church of</hi> England. Surely this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman does by vertue of his Popiſh Zeal and Iriſh Underſtanding, believe that no Titles are due to Princes in reference to the Church of God, but what are derived from the Papal Chair. Whereas I dare ſay, that <hi>Monſieur Fagel</hi> in beſtowing this Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle upon Their <hi>Highneſſes,</hi> did not dream of the Roman <hi>Pontif,</hi> but had been taught it by God Almighty, whom I take to be the Supream and true Fountain of Honour, who is pleaſed to character ſuch Princes as do cheriſh and favour his Church, by the Name of <hi>Nurſing Fathers and Nurſing Mothers,</hi> which is the term that the <hi>Penſionary</hi> uſeth in reference to their <hi>Highneſſes.</hi> And as it is their own merit, which according to the Tenor of the Divine Creation, hath entitled them to this glorious ſtile; ſo they are neither to be ridicul'd nor hectored out of that duty, of countenancing and ſupporting the Reformed Religion, nor to be deterred by bold and empty words from thoſe compaſſionate, generous, and Princely Offices to ſincere Orthodox Believers, by which they have deſerved it. And while others glory in the enjoyment of the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of moſt Chriſtian and moſt Catholick Kings, which their Vaſſalage to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> their contributing to the Exaltation of the Triple Crown, and their being the Popes Executioners in the ſhedding the Blood of Saints, hath procured unto them, 'tis enough for their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> to be by the Suffrage of all true Proteſtants, and that agreeably to the Doctrine and Authority of the Sacred Scriptures, had in eſteem, and reverenced for <hi>Nutritii</hi> and Protectors of Gods Church. Nor do they appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate this ſtile to themſelves, tho' they account it the brighteſt among all their Titles, but they acknowledge it to belong equally to many others, and are afflicted at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, than that all Potentates may not juſtly claim a ſhare in it. And as the <hi>Penſionary</hi>'s aſcribing it unto their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> was out of no deſign to uſurp upon the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Title of Defender of the Faith, nor to affix any Authority unto them over that Church, ſo it will be no preſumption to add, that all of the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in that Kingdom, how much ſoever differing in little and circumſtantial things among themſelves, are yet ſo far ſenſible of the obligations they are under to Their <hi>Highneſſes,</hi> and of the benefits they have all the Aſſurance to expect from them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, that without meaning ill either to the King or to any one elſe, they will unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly join in ſtiling them Defenders of the Chriſtian Reformed Faith, and Protectors of Gods Church profeſſing the Proteſtant Religion. And they will eaſily know with whom they are to be angry, and againſt whom to direct their Reſentments. <hi>Mijn Heer Fagel</hi> had ſaid, that if the Diſſenters cannot during his Majeſties Reign be eaſed from the Penal Laws, unleſs the Teſts be alſo abrogated, that this will be an unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs unto them, but for which the Roman Catholicks are only to be blamed, who chuſe rather to be contented, that they and their Poſterity ſhould remain ſtill obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Penal Laws, and expoſed to the hatred of the whole Nation, than be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from a capacity of attempting any thing againſt the peace and ſecurity of the Reformed Religion. Our Author whoſe envy and injuſtice againſt Their <hi>Highneſſes,</hi> is not yet fully ſpent, doth in his imprudent and indiſcreet way obtrude from hence upon the World, that <hi>the Nonconformiſts as well as the Roman Catholicks may hereby ſee where their true Intereſt ſtands, and that they are extreamly obliged to thoſe in whoſe Name this advice is given, for the Conſolation afforded them in the condition under which they are ſtated by Law.</hi> Which is as much as if he ſhould harangue the Nonconformiſts into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment againſt the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Princeſs,</hi> by aſſuring them that they are to hope for no relief againſt the Penal Laws by any favour of theirs. Whereas the Diſſenters are not only told that their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> are willing to conſent, but that they do fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:48501:182"/>that they ſhould have an entire Liberty for the full exerciſe of their Religion, without being obnoxious to receive any prejudice, trouble, or moleſtation upon that account. So that the heat which our Author would enflame the Diſſenters unto againſt their <hi>Highneſſes,</hi> ought to turn and ſpend it ſelf againſt the Papiſts, who rather than part with the <hi>Teſts</hi> which the Nonconformiſts are as much concerned to have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained as they of the National Communion can be, are reſolved to keep all the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Laws in force, and to leave the Diſſenters under the dread and apprehenſion of them. But this they may be fully perſwaded of, that if they can eſcape the edge of them during this Kings Reign, they will be in no danger from them, in caſe the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion come once to be ſo happy as to ſee their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> ſeated on the Throne. For as much as they have not only their word, which was hitherto never violated, laid to pledge for their relief and eaſe, but in that their Intereſt as well as their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples will oblige them to be compaſſionate and tender to all ſorts of Proteſtants, and if they cannot be ſo Fortunate as to unite them, yet to exerciſe equal kindneſs and favour towards them.</p>
            <p>Having examined what our Author in his impertinent way venteth in unjuſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections againſt their <hi>Highneſſes;</hi> and having in ſome meaſure chaſtned him for them, tho' not to the Degree he does deſerve; I come now in the <hi>third place</hi> to call him to an account for his calumniating the States of theſe Provinces, and for his endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to poſſeſs the minds of their Popiſh Subjects with disſatisfaction and prejudice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. And if he be the perſon whom moſt men take him for, tho' he may have herein acted ſuitably to himſelf, yet he hath behaved diſagreeably to his chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, and unworthy of the <hi>Post,</hi> which his Maſter hath placed him in. Nor need we from henceforth to doubt, but that he does all the ill Offices he can between his Majeſty of Great <hi>Brittain</hi> and this Government, ſeeing he hath by ſlanders deſtitute of all Foundation, moſt maliciouſly ſtudied to raiſe differences betwixt them and their own Subjects. And if the Intelligence which he tranſmits to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> be as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually diſtant from truth and ſincerity, as the <hi>Memoirs</hi> are which he hath here publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we may eaſily conjecture what little credit ought to be given unto it, tho' at the ſame time we cannot but diſcern the end that it muſt be ſhappen and deſigned unto. Nor was there the leaſt occaſion adminiſtred by <hi>mijn Heer Fagel</hi> in his <hi>Letter,</hi> by which our Author could be provoked to attack theſe <hi>States,</hi> with ſo much rudeneſs, injuſtice, and falſhood, as he hath done in his <hi>Anſwer.</hi> For all that the <hi>Penſionary</hi> had ſaid, and which it ſeems threw our Author into a raging fit, was only that their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> could conſent that the Papiſts in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhould be ſuffered to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their Religion with as much freedom, as is allowed them in theſe Provinces, in which they enjoy a full liberty of Conſcience. And as the time hath been, and may hereafter come, Wherein the Engliſh Roman Catholicks would have thought, and may again account ſuch a Liberty for a happineſs; ſo I do not underſtand if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Roman Catholicks in theſe Countreys, be as our Author deſcribes it, with what conſiſtency either to Reaſon or with themſelves, the Papiſts in <hi>England,</hi> ſhould have ſo often heretofore in their <hi>Pleas</hi> for a Toleration, have made the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty vouchſafed their Brethren in theſe Provinces, not only a motive for their own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing capable of Indulgence, but to have repreſented it as the largeſt meaſure of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom they deſired, and which they would have been thankful for. Seeing this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman according to his accuſtomed manner of truth and ingenuity takes upon him to aſſure us, <hi>That as there can be no greater perſecution, than what the Papists undergo in the exerciſe of their Religion, in</hi> Guelderland, Freeſland, Zeland, <hi>and the Province of</hi> Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningue; <hi>ſo that the Liberty which they even enjoy in</hi> Holland, <hi>is ſo mean and inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that it doth not deliver them from being ſubject to daily fines and moleſtations.</hi> Surely this man is either very unacquainted with what is done upon the account of Religion in other parts of the World, or elſe he muſt needs think, that the moſt brutal ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities to ſome, are Acts of Merit; while gentle reſtrictions upon others, are mortal Crimes, otherwiſe he could never write at this ignorant and extravagant rate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all perſons muſt diſcern his folly as well as inſincerity and neglect of truth. For we have too many deplorable evidences daily before our Eyes, beſides thoſe which arrive with us by reports of unqueſtionable credit, of a ſtranger kind of <hi>Perſecution</hi> exerciſed towards thoſe of the Reformed Religion in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Piedmont,</hi> than any which the Roman Catholicks in theſe Provinces can be alledged to be under, except it be by one of our Author's veracity and diſcretion. Neither needs there any other Refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the calumny with which he aſperſeth the Supream and Subordinate Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of this Country in reference to the treating their Popiſh Subjects with horrid Severities, nor a clearer proof that thoſe of the Romiſh Communion, do eſteem them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be in a condition of peace, freedom and eaſe under this Government, than
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:48501:182"/>that of their behaviour during the late War carried on by the <hi>French</hi> King againſt theſe States, which he gave out both at <hi>Rome</hi> and at ſeveral other Courts in <hi>Europe,</hi> to have been undertaken in favour, and for the reſtoring of the Roman Catholick Religion, For had they lain under that grievous perſecution, and thoſe tragical hardſhips in the practice of it, which our Author would impoſe the belief of upon the World; they would not have failed to welcome that Monarch as their happy Deliverer, and would have united in a general Inſurrection againſt the States, for their having been Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous over them. But inſtead of that, moſt of them acquitted themſelves with the ſame Zeal for the ſupport of this Government, and in defence of their Country, that other Subjects did. Which demonſtrates beyond all controul, that they do not judge themſelves to be in ſo wretched and miſerable circumſtances, as this bold and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Perſon repreſents them to be. And whereas <hi>Monſieur Fagel</hi> in juſtification of the neceſſity of preſerving the <hi>Teſt Laws</hi> by which the Papiſts are precluded from Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments and Places of Truſt, and to rectifie a miſtake in Mr. <hi>Stewart</hi> about his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Roman Catholicks to continue capable of bearing publick Offices in this Commonwealth, had ſaid, that by the Laws of this Republick they are expreſly ſhut out from all the Employments both of Policy and Juſtice. Our Author does hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the higheſt Injuſtice, and with all the acrimony he can, accuſe the States, not only <hi>of departing from the expreſs Terms of the Pacification of</hi> Gant, <hi>but of violating the Articles of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion at</hi> Utrecht, <hi>which was the Foundation upon which this Government was both originally erected and doth ſtill ſubſiſt.</hi> And with his wonted degree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and prudence he further adds, <hi>That the Provinces, and moſt of the Cities, would not have entred into the foreſaid <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, but upon condition that they of the Roman Catholick Religion ſhould at all times poſſeſs the Government. And particularly that</hi> Amſterdam, <hi>had it ſtipulated unto them, under the Guaranty of the Prince of</hi> Orange, <hi>that none of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion ſhould be allowed a Place to aſſemble in, either within the Walls, or without, ſo far as the Juriſdiction of the City did extend.</hi> One would have little expected, that a perſon living in the Communion of the Romiſh Church, as our Author profeſſeth himſelf to do, ſhould upbraid theſe States with the violation of Articles, relating un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Grant made unto any for their Security in the free Exerciſe of their Religion, at a ſeaſon when Popiſh Soveraigns not only account it their glory to break all Laws, Oaths and Edicts, by which Proteſtants had their Religion, together with many other Rights and Priviledges, eſtabliſhed and confirmed unto them, but who with a ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vageneſs and barbarity which ſcarce any Age can parallel, ſeek to extirpate their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and deſtroy them. And all this attempted and purſued againſt them, not only without their being guilty of any crime, by which they might have deſerved to loſe the favour of their Princes, and to forfeit protection in the free exerciſe of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and their ſafety as to their Perſons and Eſtates, which had been ſworn unto them, and ſecured by Authentick Laws: But when one of the chiefeſt motives unto it, was their Loyalty, and the Merit that they had laid upon their reſpective Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns, which by a new way of gratitude was thought fit to be thus recompenſed and rewarded. And if we be not, as I have formerly ſaid, ſtrangely deceived in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Character of our Author, this charge upon the States of theſe Provinces, is the effect of a moſt prodigious folly, as well as of inveterate malice, in that his Maſter contrary both to the Laws of the Realms, his often repeated Promiſes, and his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation Oath, aſſumes a power of introducing thoſe into Offices, who by the Statutes of the Land ſtand precluded from them, and of thruſting them out, who alone are the Perſon that are legally capable of them. Which manner of proceeding in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, hath beſides the injuſtice that attends it towards all that are laid aſide, a ſignal piece of ingratitude accompanying it to many of them, as having been the Perſons, whoſe Zeal for his Perſon brought him to the Throne, and whoſe courage maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in it. But I ſhall not think it enough meerly to have expoſed his imprudence and indiſcretion in the forementioned accuſation againſt the whole Governing Body of this Country; but I ſhall likewiſe ſhew it to be falſe, ſlanderous, and unjuſt in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part and branch of it. And that I may act with more truth and candour than our Author hath done, I do acknowledge, that at the firſt commencement of the War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> for the defence of the Laws and Priviledges of theſe and the neighbouring Provinces, that not only they of the Reformed Religion, but likewiſe the Roman Catholicks, took Arms and hazarded their Lives and Eſtates in that juſt quarrel. And I do alſo grant that thereupon there was Liberty of Conſcience allowed and eſtabliſhed by ſeveral Treaties, in the vertue of which, both parties were to be equally tolerated, and the one not to diſturb or diſquiet the other. Nor was there ever any thing done by way of Ordinance or Law, to leſſen or reſtrain the liberty of the Papiſts, nor to abridge, much leſs deprive them, of any Power, Juriſdiction and
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:48501:183"/>Authority that they poſſeſſed, ſo long as they remained faithful in the common cauſe, and behaved themſelves with Equity, Juſtice and Peace towards thoſe who had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from the Roman Communion. But ſuch was the aſcendency of the Prieſts o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Roman Catholicks, and ſo powerful was their influence upon them, that in a little time they not only hindred and moleſted the Proteſtants in the exerciſe of their Religion, and committed many unjuſt and cruel ſeverities againſt them, but they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to various attempts of betraying the Rights and Civil Liberties of the whole Country, and of enſlaving it both to the Tyranny of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to the bloudy and cruel Inquiſition. So that from hence it became a matter of neceſſity ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than at firſt of choice, that the Government ſhould be diſpoſed into Proteſtant hands; and that the liberty of the Papiſts, ſhould have thoſe limits and regulations given unto it, as might render it both conſiſtent with the peace, freedom, and ſafety of thoſe of the Reformed Religion, and with the preſervation of the Civil Rights and Priviledges of theſe Provinces. This is the account, which all who have written with any knowledge and integrity of the Tranſactions of thoſe Times, do give us of the many Changes and Revolutions that fell out in reference to Religion, till all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters both concerning it, and the Political Government of theſe Countreys came to be eſtabliſhed in the Form and Way, wherein they do ſtill continue and ſubſiſt. And this I do undertake to make good by all publick, Authentick, and approved Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, if our Author ſhall have the confidence to inſiſt upon the juſtification of his cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, And all that I ſhall at preſent direct men unto for the confirmation of what I have ſaid, is that admirable <hi>Apology</hi> of <hi>William</hi> I. Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> whom his preſent <hi>Highneſs,</hi> does in Wiſdom, Steddineſs, and true temperate Chriſtian Zeal ſo ſignally imitate, and which that great Prince, who was the firſt and happy Founder of this Republick, publiſhed in defence of himſelf, and of thoſe actings, for which the ſlaviſh and mercenary Factors of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> had traduced and aſperſed him. But let us advance to a particular Examination of thoſe matters of Fact, upon which our Author challengeth theſe States <hi>for violating their Faith</hi> with their <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Subjects.</hi> And the things he is pleaſed to ſpecifie, <hi>are their departing from the Terms of the Pacification of</hi> Gant, <hi>and their breaking the Articles of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion agreed unto at</hi> U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trecht, 1597. Nor am I unwilling to acknowledge, that ſoon after the <hi>Pacification</hi> concluded at <hi>Gant,</hi> there were ſeveral indecent and undiſcreet things done contrary to the purport and tendency of it, both by thoſe of the Romiſh, and by them of the Reformed Religion. Which proceeded from the Superſtitious Fury of the former, and the imprudent Zeal of the latter. Yet it is certain, that the ground of its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be rendred wholly ineffectual, aroſe from a deſign of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cloak and palliation of that Treaty, to ſubvert the Civil Rights and Priviledges of all the Provinces, to the Defence and Preſervation of which the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks as well as Proteſtants were ſworn and bound by the ſaid <hi>Pacification.</hi> For after that <hi>Philip</hi> II. had in compliance with the neceſſity of this Affairs, conſented unto, and ratified all the Terms, Proviſions and Conditions, which both the Papiſts and the Reformed had in that <hi>Pacification,</hi> League and Confederacy, inſiſted upon, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to adhere unto; it was ſoon after diſcovered by Letters intercepted to <hi>Don John,</hi> who was at that time conſtituted Governour over the Low Countreys, that all which <hi>Philip</hi> aim'd at, was thro the having rendred them ſecure by the Ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Treaty, to take advantages whereby to enſlave them, and under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert of it, to provide himſelf of means, by which he might be eſtabliſhed in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded Tyranny over them. So that by reaſon of what was detected in thoſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and from <hi>Don John</hi>'s proceeding to poſſeſs himſelf of <hi>Namur,</hi> and his endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to corrupt and debauch the German Troops, which were in the States ſervice, and paid by them, together with the defection of many of the Roman Catholicks from all the Terms of that Pacification; the War came again to be revived againſt the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and all that had been agreed unto at <hi>Gant,</hi> was rendred ineffectual and overthrown. And I would fain know of our Learned and Wiſe Author, how the States of the <hi>Seven</hi> Provinces are more guilty of the violation of that <hi>Pacification,</hi> by making the Proteſtant Religion, to be that of the publick Eſtabliſhment, within their Territories and Juriſdiction; than the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the States of the <hi>Spaniſh Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> are in their denying a Toleration of the Proteſtant Religion in thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; ſeeing I am ſure it was agreed and ſworn unto in that <hi>Pacification.</hi> And as for the Union concluded at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> the Terms whereof our Author upbraids theſe States with a departure from: It will be no difficult matter to ſhew how his knowledge and ſincerity are in reference to this particular of one meaſure and piece. For tho' diverſe of the Provinces, which entred into that Union, did thereby enjoy a Liberty of chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and determining which of the two Religions ſhould have the ſtamp of the publick
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:48501:183"/>eſtabliſhment within their own Juriſdictions; yet it was then and there ordained, that the Proteſtant Religion alone ſhould be publickly profeſſed, and have the protection of the Laws in the Provinces of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand.</hi> And as the other Provinces were left to do, as they ſhould judge beſt for the peace and ſafety of their reſpective Territories, and the ſupport and defence of the Union; ſo it is a thing wherein all that have written with any integrity, do agree, that the alterations which were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards made in theſe Provinces, or in reference unto them, concerning Religion, were either reſolved and decreed in the Provincial Aſſemblies of the States of thoſe ſeveral Provinces, or elſe in the meetings of the States-General, where not only the Deputies of thoſe ſeveral Provinces were preſent and conſenting, but behoved to have the approbation of their Principals, in order to the rendring thoſe Alterations le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and binding. Nor is it unworthy to be obſerved, that the chief occaſion for ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Roman Catholicks out of the Government, and for depreſſing the Romiſh Religion from being Dominant, aroſe from the Papiſts themſelves, in that not only contrary to their ſtripulations and promiſes, they were found in the verture of a malice imbib'd from their Religion, to be upon all occaſions committing violences and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages againſt the Reformed, but in that the Roman Catholick Magiſtrates, and many others of that Communion, were diſcovered to retain too great an inclination to <hi>Spain,</hi> and to be ready to abandon and betray the Freedom and Civil Rights of their Countrey, inſtead of continuing ſtedfaſt and faithful in the defence of them, as they had covenanted and ſworn. In a word, as neither the Articles of the Union at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> nor any other Terms agreed upon, before the Abdication of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> which was not until <hi>Anno</hi> 1581. can be called the Fundamental Laws of the Government of this Republick, tho' they may be ſtiled conditions upon which ſuch and ſuch Provinces Aſſociated for mutual defence againſt the Spaniſh Power and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny; ſo it is undeniable, that by reaſon of the many dangers they found themſelves expoſed unto, and the hazards they had run of being betrayed again into the hands of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> through their having ſuffered the Magiſtracy to remain any wherein Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and thro' their having allowed the Roman Catholick Religion to be publickly preached and exerciſed, they thereupon re-aſſumed and gave a new frame unto their Union in the Year 1583. in which it was agreed and enacted by all the Provinces, that from that time forward, the Reformed Religion ſhould alone be openly profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and preached, and that none but Proteſtants ſhould from that time be admitted to any Office of Policy and Juſtice in the Government. And as this is the true Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Law upon which this State hath ſince ſo happily ſubſiſted and flouriſhed; ſo there can be nothing objected againſt the Juſtice of it, but what will lye againſt all States of the World, who have always changed and moulded their Laws, as they have been neceſſitated in order to ſelf-preſervation. And ſo remote from all truth, is our Author's affirming the Roman Catholicks to have been upon theſe Alterations brought under Perſecution; that Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> whom the World will much ſooner believe than this Gentleman, tho' poſſibly he may bear the ſame character which that worthy perſon once did, does aſſure us in his excellent <hi>Obſervations upon the United Provinces of the</hi> Netherlands. That <hi>no Papiſt can here complain of being preſſed in his Conſcience, of being reſtrained from his own manner of Worſhip in his Houſe, or obliged to any other abroad, and that all ſuch, who ask no more than to ſerve God and ſave their own Souls, have as much Freedom, Eaſe and Security as they can deſire.</hi> Yea it is demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the Roman Catholicks enjoy advantages under this Government, which they have not in Popiſh States. In that being ſuffered to exerciſe their Relgion ſo far as is neceſſary to attain all the ends of it, if it be capable of affording them any whereon they can hereafter find themſelves happy; they are delivered from the Tyranny of Prieſts over their Perſons and Eſtates, and hindred from being in a condition to do that ill to others, which the Doctrines of their Church would both tempt them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to and juſtifie them in. And as to that which our Author ſays of the injuſtice done to the City of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and of the violating the Conditions towards the Roman Catholicks there, upon which under the guaranty of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> they came into the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion;</hi> he is miſtaken in that whole matter, and betrays only his ignorance, infidelity, or both. For the Conditions which he mentioneth, were the reſult of an Agreement made <hi>Anno</hi> 1578. when upon the <hi>Naſſovian</hi> Army's coming before their City to attack them, they abandoned the Party and Intereſt of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> whom they had till that time adhered unto, and came into an Alliance with the reſt of the Towns of the Province, to oppoſe him in defence of the Priviledges of theſe Countreys. And as this was a year before the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> concluded at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> into which <hi>Amſterdam</hi> entred at the ſame time that <hi>Gelderland, Zutphen, Holland, Zealand,</hi> and <hi>Utrecht</hi> did; ſo they joined in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> upon the ſame Terms, that the other Towns
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:48501:184"/>of their own Province had agreed unto. Nor could the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> be <hi>Guaranty</hi> in reference to the conditions ſpecified in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion;</hi> foraſmuch as tho the Act of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> was ſigned <hi>Jan.</hi> 23. 1579. yet the Prince did not ſign it till the <hi>May</hi> following. And that the Roman Catholick Magiſtrates, came to be diveſted of the Government, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Articles made with them when they forſook the party of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> they have none to blame for it but themſelves, nor was there that injuſtice in it which our Author does imagine. For not being ſatisfied to remain diſobedient and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory to an Edict and Decree of the Arch-Duke <hi>Matthias</hi> and the Council of State, who Anno 1578. had appointed, that whereſoever there were a hundred Families of thoſe profeſſing the Reformed Religion, that they ſhould there be allowed a Church or Chappel for the exerciſe of their Worſhip; they not only broke all their capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made with the Proteſtants, thro oppreſſing them in various, ſevere, unjuſt, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod's, and in denying them a decent and convenient place in which they might bury their dead, but they were found to be ſtill inclining to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Intereſt, and ready to eſpouſe it upon the firſt convenient opportunity. And therefore the Proteſtants, who were by much the majority, partly to relieve themſelves from the ſufferings which were daily inflicted upon them contrary to ſtipulations and Articles, and partly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the miſchiefs which would have enſued to the whole Country, ſhould that City have been betrayed again into the power and hands of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> aſſumed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to themſelves, and eaſed the other party of the Truſt, which they had ſo unwiſely and unrighteouſly managed. Nor can our Author deny, but that ſince they took on them the Ruling Authority, they have exerciſed it with all the moderation that can be expreſſed. And have been ſo far from returning to the Roman Catholicks, the like meaſures which themſelves had met with, that they have in no one thing given them cauſe to complain, unleſs they ſhould quarrel that they are kept out of capacity of doing the miſchief, their prieſts would otherway's be ready to excite them unto, and which their Religion would countenance them in.</p>
            <p>But it is now time that I ſhould proceed to the <hi>fourth</hi> thing, for which I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to call our <hi>Anonymous</hi> Anſwerer to an account. And were he not of a ſingular <hi>Forehead,</hi> and of a peculiar complexion from all others; he could not have had the impudence to endeavour to deceive the world into a belief, that the Proteſtant Diſſenters in <hi>England,</hi> ſtand liſted by their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> into the ſame rank with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and that they are hereafter to expect, to be ſhut up into the ſame ſtate and condition. Certainly he muſt either have an Antipathy woven into his nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all truth and ſincerity, or elſe thro having long accuſtomed himſelf to the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reporting of perſons and to the giving falſe repreſentations of things, he muſt at laſt have acquired an incurable Habit, otherwiſe it were impoſſible to prevaricate to that degree from truth, in every thing he medleth with, and which he undertaketh to ſay. For <hi>Mijn Heer Fagel</hi> having declared, that the reaſon why their Highneſſes can not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the Repeal of the Teſt Laws, is becauſe they are of no other tendency, than to ſecure the Reformed Religion from the deſigns of the Roman Catholicks, and that they contain only conditions and proviſions, whereby men may be qualified to be Members of Parliament, and to bear publick Offices. Our Author hereupon tells us. <hi>That the Nonconformiſts as well as the Roman Catholicks, do apprehend that they receive a great deal of damage, by thoſe Laws, and do account them extremely prejudicial to their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Families.</hi> And where as <hi>Monſieur Fagel</hi> had ſaid, that he would be glad to hear one good Reaſon, whereby a Proteſtant fearing God, and concerned for his Religion, could be prevailed upon to conſent to the Repealing of theſe Laws which have been enacted by the Authority of King and Parliament, and that have no other tendency ſave the providing for the ſafety of the Reformed Religion, and the hindring Roman Catholicks from being in a capacity to ſubvert it. Our Author in way of reflection upon this, tells us, that it is not only <hi>a Childiſh demand, but that it is to be hop'd that the penſionary will from hence be brought to acknowledg, how trifling and weak all thoſe Reaſons are, by which he would preclude the Nonconformiſts as well as the Roman Catholicks from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Employments.</hi> So that by theſe and many other paſſages equally falſe and diſingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in our Author's pretended Anſwer, which for brevity's ſake I forbear to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is apparent that he endeavours to perſwade the world into a belief, that the Diſſenters are ſtaed by their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> in the ſame rank and condition with the Papiſts, and are to expect to be treated in the ſame manner, in caſe it pleaſe the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God to bring Their Highneſſes to the Throne. One would wonder at this ſudden and ſtrange change in the opinion and conduct of the Papiſts towards the Nonconformiſts; that they who were repreſented by them a while ago' as unfit to live in His Majeſties Dominions; ſhould now come to be accounted the Kings beſt and moſt Faithful Subjects, and worthy to be advanced to the chief Truſts and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy's
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:48501:184"/>'Tis but a few years ſince, that all the Laws enacted againſt them, were judged to be too few and gentle, and therefore they had Laws executed upon them, to which the Legiſlators had never made them obnoxious; but now the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks are become ſo tender of their eaſe and ſafety, that out of pure kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto them, if any will be ſo fooliſh as to believe it, they muſt have Laws abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, which in the worſt times, and during the moſt illegal and barbarous proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures againſt them, they were never affected with nor ſuffered the leaſt prejudice by. And whereas it was the only way for perſons heretofore to make their Court at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, by declaiming againſt the Diſſenters as Rebels and Traitors, and by putting them into a ſalvage Dreſs, to be run upon as beaſts of prey; it is now grown the only method of becoming gracious at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> to proclaim their Loyalty, and to cry them up for the only people in whom his Majeſty, with ſafety to his Perſon and Crown, can repoſe a confidence. But under all the Shapes which the Papiſts do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, they may be eaſily diſcovered to retain the ſame malice to the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and only to act thoſe various and oppoſite parts, in order the better to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it. And the Diſſenters being haraſſed and oppreſſed before, and indulged and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed now, was upon the ſame motive of hatred unto it, and in ſubſerviency to its extirpation. The method's are altered, but the deſign is one, and tho they have chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Tools, yet they remain conſtant in the purſuance of the ſame End. While they of the Church of <hi>England</hi> were found compliant with the ways, which the Factors for <hi>Rome</hi> thought ſerviceable thereunto, they were not only the Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of the Court and of the whole Popiſh party, but were gratified, at leaſt as was pretended, with a rigorous execution of the Penal Laws upon Diſſenters. But there remaining ſeveral ſteps to be taken for the introduction of Popery, and the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Reformed Religion, which they of the National Communion would not go along with them in, they are forced to ſhift Inſtruments, and to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Nonconformiſts; whoſe aſſiſtance the better to engage, they have not only ſuſpended all the Penal Laws, to which the Diſſenters were liable, but have endeavoured to fill' them with jealouſy and apprehenſion of danger from the Teſt Acts, tho at the ſame time they know that Nonconformiſts never either did, or could receive prejudice by them. Only they are ſenſible, that if they could work up that eaſie people into ſuch a belief, they ſhould thereby not only obtain their concurrence and abettment, for the reſcinding of thoſe Laws, that are at preſent the only great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Fence about our Religion, and upon the abrogation whereof nothing could hinder the Papiſts from getting into a condition to extirpate it; but make them a formed and united Body with themſelves againſt the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Princeſs</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> who have with ſo much Wiſdom, Courage and Integrity, declared that they are againſt the having them repealed. And as the Diſſenters cannot have ſo far renounced all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard both to honeſty and to a good name, as to be fond of being herded with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, or thank our Author for it; ſo they muſt be become void of all ſenſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, if they ſuffer themſelves to be either wheedled or frighted into an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their being ſubject to receive any dammage by the Teſts; it being ſo expreſly contrary both to the Terms of thoſe Laws, and to their own experience. Nor can they be ſo far abandoned of God, nor prove ſo treacherous to the Nation, Poſterity and the whole Proteſtant Intereſt thro' Europe, as to cooperate to the Repeal of them, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying that great Fence about the Reformed Religion in <hi>England,</hi> and to put the Papiſts into capacity both of ſubverting it there and every where elſe. And ſetting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide a few mercenary fellows among them, there is no ground to fear, after we have had ſo many proofs of their zeal for the Proteſtant Religion and Engliſh Liberties, in the worſt of times and under the greateſt Temptations, that they ſhould at this ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when all others behave themſelves with ſo much Integrity and Courage, be acceſſory to ſo villanous a thing. The ill ſucceſs which the Court hath met with in the ſeveral Towns and City's, ſince the late Regulation of the Corporations, ſufficiently ſhews, that the Diſſenters who were put into Magiſtracy, in hopes by them to have compaſſed the packing of a Parliament, are no leſs careful of preſerving the Teſt Laws, than they of the Church of <hi>England</hi> Communion were, who were diſplaced to make way for them. And to diſcover the groſsneſs of the abuſe, which our Author, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard to Truth or Ingenuity, endeavours to put upon them, as if they were judged by their Highneſſes to be incapable of Truſts and Employments, or any ways concluded to ſtand under thoſe reſtraints by the Teſt, which the Roman Catholicks do; there is not one word in <hi>Mijn Heer Fagel</hi>'s Letter, whereby they are ſaid to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto them, or by which there is any ground adminiſtred of fancying they are put into the ſame rank with the Papiſts, and whereby to fear that they may hereafter come to be treated accordingly. But in ſtead of this, they are expreſly told, that Their
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:48501:185"/>
               <hi>Highneſſes</hi> do both allow and deſire the abrogation of all the Penal Laws againſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, and the having them freed from the ſeverity of them; and that they do not only conſent but heartily approve of their having an entire liberty granted them for the full exerciſe of their Religion, without any trouble or hindrance, or being left expoſed to the leaſt moleſtation or inconvenience upon that account. And to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie how far the Nonconformiſts are from being in the leaſt menaced by thoſe Laws, it is again Declared, that the only reaſon why their <hi>Highneſſes</hi> refuſe to conſent to the having them repealed, is, becauſe that they have no other tendency, ſave to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Reformed Religion from the Deſigns of the Papiſts, by containing provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the vertue of which, thoſe only may be kept out of Office who can not teſtifie that they are of the Reformed, and not of the Roman Catholick Religion. Which as it is the higheſt evidence imaginable, of their own ſtedfaſtneſs and integrity in the Reformed Religion, and of the compaſſion and love which they equally bear to all who profeſs it, and how careful they will at all times be to have it maintained and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported; ſo it is the putting ſuch a merit upon all Proteſtants, that it ſhould engage their prayers for their happy extation to the Throne, and make them ambitious as well as willing and ready to hazard their lives and Fortunes, for the ſecuring the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion unto them, if any ſhould be ſo wicked as to go about to preclude them.</p>
            <p>But I muſt pay a further attendance upon our Author, and accompany him to the <hi>fifth</hi> particular which I promiſed to conſider; namely that according to his own fooliſh and incoherent way of writing, while he pretends to commend and juſtify the proceeding of His Majeſty of Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> he publiſheth the villany of the Papal Church, and proclaims the diſhonour and injuſtice of diverſe Eminent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs and Princes of the Romiſh Communion. His <hi>Panegyricks</hi> upon the King of <hi>England,</hi> are ſo many juſt <hi>Satyr's</hi> upon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Monarch of <hi>France,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy, &amp;c.</hi> For if it be <hi>becoming a Christian, to be of a contrary judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to thoſe who are for perſecuting ſuch as differ from the publick and eſtabliſhed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and if it be a ſentiment worthy of a Royal mind, that none ought to be oppreſſed for their Conſciences in Divine Matters;</hi> what characters of irreligion, ignominy, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, are due unto them, who judge it to be meritorious to deſtroy ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, for no other pretended Crime, ſave that they cannot believe as the Pope and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do. Surely our Author muſt either be extreamly ignorant of the Doctrine of his own Church, and of the bloody and barbarous practices purſuant thereunto, both at this day, and for many ages paſt; or elſe he muſt be the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincere miſcreant that ever writ, or at beſt be guilty of the inconſiſtency and folly as to continue in the Communion of a Church, whoſe Articles of Faith he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns as Antichriſtian, and whoſe practices according to the Terms made neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for Salvation, he abhorreth both as unworthy of Royal Minds, and contrary to Chriſtian Piety. But tho nothing can render a falſe man honeſt, or a fooliſh Man wiſe, yet ſeeing ſomething may be done towards the curing a perſon's ignorance if he be teachable, or at leaſt to ſhew his obſtinacy, and that the fault is in his will, not in his Underſtanding, if he will not learn and be convinced; I ſhall therefore both acquaint him a little with the Doctrine of that Church, and briefly put him in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, how theſe of the Romiſh Fellowſhip have therefore perſecuted Chriſtians, and ſtill continue ſo to do, only for differing from the publick and eſtabliſhed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. As to the firſt, it is ſufficiently known that according to the judgment of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> we are Hereticks, and that Hereſie being <hi>Crimen laeſae Majeſtatis Divinae,</hi> we are therefore the worſt of Traitors, and liable to the Penalties of the greateſt High Treaſon. And thereupon we are not only declared to be infamous and ſentenced to be deprived of all Honor and Dignity, and to be incapable of all Offices, and have our Eſtates confiſcated and ſeiſed; but we are condemned to be burnt, and if that cannot conveniently be effected, it is both made lawful and meritorious to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate us by War or Maſſacre, as ſhall be beſt and moſt ſafe for the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> In order whereunto, not only all Laws made for our Security are declared to be null, and that no promiſes made unto us, ought to be kept; but all Princes, that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to deſtory and extirpate us, are proclaimed to be depoſed. And ſutable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto has their carriage been for many ages to ſuch as differ from them in Articles of Faith, and will not joyn in their Superſtitions and Idolatries. In proof where of I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need to inſiſt upon the infinite Murders, committed by the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> the moſt Deviliſh Engine of Cruelty that ever the World was acquainted with, nor to reflect ſo far backward as the <hi>Pariſian</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Maſſacres, or the infinite Slaughters perpetrated heretofore in <hi>France, Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Low Countreys, &amp;c.</hi> ſeeing we have ſuch freſh and doleful evidences of the mercy and gentleneſs of the Papal Church, in the ungrateful, inhumane, perjurious, and ſalvage perſecutions executed ſo lately
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:48501:185"/>in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Piedmont. If it be the effect of Royal and Paternal affection in the King of</hi> England <hi>to his Subjects, that all he endeavoureth, is to treat them as becomes a common Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without making any diſtinction between one and another,</hi> as our Author is pleaſed to call it in his Teſtimony concerning him; what cruel Parents muſt many Princes of the Roman Communion be, who act with that difference towards their people, that while they cheriſh and embrace ſome, they tear out the Bowels, and ſuck the blood of others? And if no Society deſtitute of ſuch tender and Chriſtian affections, can merit the name of a Church, we hence learn where to faſten the character of being the <hi>Mother of Harlots.</hi> In that we not only know whoſe Doctrine it is, that whom She cannot convert, She ought to deſtroy; but that we have obſerved her, to have been in all Ages <hi>drunk with the Blood of Saints.</hi> All the commendations our Author be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows upon the King of <hi>England;</hi> are not only either ſo many accuſations of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties inſincerity in the Papal Faith, or infallible indications that both the King (pardon the expreſſion) and his Miniſter, are Hypocritical Diſſemblers; but they are ſtabbing and twinging Satyr's againſt Mother Church, and the Holy Father, and againſt his Brittanick Majeſties dear Brother and Ally the <hi>French</hi> King. Nor can we be guilty either of Crime or Indecency, in the worſt we can ſay of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Moſt Chriſtian King; ſeeing we have in equivalent Terms a Preſident for it, both from ſo good a Catholick, and ſo wiſe a Miniſter of a great Monarch, as our honourable Author is.</p>
            <p>And tho I begin to grow weary of converſing with ſo impertinent a man, yet I am bound to wait upon him a little longer, and while the Reader can reap no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by any thing he ſays, to ſee whether it be not poſſible to lay hold of an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from his Ignorance and Folly, to communicate things that may be more ſolid and inſtructive. The <hi>ſixth</hi> thing therefore whereof I accuſed him, and for which I promiſed to call him to an account, is his egregious ignorance in relation to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Laws, Cuſtoms, and matters of Fact, <hi>Mijn Heer Fagel</hi> tells us, that the <hi>Teſt</hi> Laws being enacted by King and Parliament for the Security of the Reformed Religion, and the Roman Catholicks receiving no prejudice by them, but being meerly reſtrained from getting into a condition to ſubvert it, therefore Their <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> could not conſent to their Repeal. And he further adds, that there is no Kingdom, Common-wealth, or any conſtituted Body and Society, in which there are not Laws made for the ſafety thereof, which not only provide againſt all attempts that may diſturb their peace, but which preſcribe ſuch conditions as they judge ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, for the diſcerning who are qualified to bear Employments. To which he again ſubjoins, that there is a great difference between the conduct of theſe of the Reformed Religion towards Roman Catholicks, which is moderate, and only to prevent their getting into a capacity to do hurt; and that of thoſe of the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion towards the Reformed, who not being ſatisfied to exclude them from places of Truſt, do both ſuppreſs the whole Exerciſe of their Religion and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely perſecute all that profeſs it. And he finally adds, that both Reaſon and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the preſent, as well as paſt Ages do ſhew, that it is impoſſible for Roman Catholicks, and thoſe of the Reformed Religion, when joyned together in places of Truſt, and publick Employment, to maintain a good Correſpondence, live in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual peace, and to diſcharge their Offices quietly and to the publick Good. Now from theſe ſeveral paſſages, which carry their own evidence along with them, our Author takes occaſion both to vent his fooliſh and ridiculous Politicks, and to proclaim his ignorance in Hiſtory and of the moſt obvious matters of Fact. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we ſhall have the patience to hearken to what he hath been pleaſed to ſay, and ſhall examine it piece by piece, as we go along. And the firſt thing he does is to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us with a mighty Myſtery of State, and which none but ſo great a Miniſter could have been able to have revealed; namely, that tho <hi>the King and Parliament upon the firſt Revolution with reſpect to Religion, and the introducing and ſetting up the Reformed Religion, thought fit to make thoſe Laws which they judged neceſſary for its preſervation; yet that it does not follow that his preſent Majeſty and a Parliament would be of the ſame mind, but that they might enact Laws of a differing Nature from the former, and re-eſtabliſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion into the ſame State, in which it was before the Reformed Doctrine and Worſhip was ſet up.</hi> We are much obliged to our Author for this diſcovery, though I muſt add, that this it is to truſt a Fool with ſecrets, for he will be ſure to be blabbing. For tho he ſubjoin, that he will not ſay that matters would be puſhed ſo far; yet he hath already told us enough, to make us underſtand both what his own hopes are, and what is deſigned by the Papal party, if they could compaſs a Parliament of a Complexion and Temper to their mind. But there are two fatal things, which lye in their way. One is, that neither progreſſing nor cloſeting, bribing nor threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:48501:186"/>can prove effectual to give them the ſlendereſt ground of confidence of their obtaining a Parliament of that mould and conſtitution. And the ſecond is, that all the Members muſt take the Teſts, before they can be a Legal Parliament; and then there is little probability, that they who can make the Declaration required in theſe Laws, will be inclinable to Repeal them; eſpecially at a ſeaſon, when their own ſafety as well as that of the Proteſtant Religion, renders it ſo neceſſary to have them maintained. Whatſoever any Body of men, by what name ſoever they be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or within what walls ſoever they aſſemble, ſhall attempt to do, without firſt having taken the Teſts; is <hi>ipſo facto</hi> null and void in Law, and will ſerve to no Legal purpoſe, but to make themſelves obnoxious to the ſevereſt puniſhments, which the Juſtice of a provoked and betrayed Nation can be able to inflict upon them. So that we do not doubt what the King would do, for the re-eſtabliſhing Popery and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the Proteſtant Religion, could he get a Parliament to his mind; but our hope is that he will not, and the better to prevent it, we will endeavour to keep our Teſt Laws. But to go on with our Author, who with his accuſtomed ignorance, but perſonating here the wiſdom of a <hi>Solon</hi> or a <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> takes upon him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us, that <hi>as nothing can be called the fundamental Law of a Kingdom or a Republick, but what was enacted at the commencement of that State or Society, before any alterations could fall out in it with reference to Religion; ſo nothing deſerves the name of ſuch a Law ſave that which is to the advantage and benefit of all the Subjects.</hi> It were not amiſs here to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, by what Authority our Author faſtens on <hi>Mijn Heer Fagel</hi> this Term of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Law in reference to the Teſts; ſeeing he never uſed it in his Letter much leſs applyed it to ſuch a purpoſe. But falſifying is ſo natural to this Gentleman, that he could not avoid it, even when he might have been ſenſible, that he would not eſcape the being challenged for it. There is a Countrey in the world, that is ſaid to bear no poyſonous animal, nor had it need, ſeeing if any number of the Natives be of the mould and frame that ſome are, there are brutal and venemous Creatures enough in it, tho there be neither Toad nor Serpent there. But may not the Teſt Laws anſwer the end they were deſigned unto, of being a Fence about Religion, tho they be none of the Fundamental Laws of the Government. It is not the name that alone gives value to a Law; but the Sanction of the Legiſlative Authority, and the uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it to the publick good. A Statute, that was occaſioned by a neceſſity ariſing in reference to the publick Safety, ought as much to be ſtood by and upheld while that neceſſity continues, as if it were an original Law and Coaeval with the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And if it was the indiſpenſable dependance of the Welfare and Safety of the Community upon ſuch and ſuch Proviſions at firſt, that gave them the Name of Fundamental Laws; I am ſure, that under our preſent Circumſtances, we may call the Teſt Laws abſolutely needful, if we aſſume not the vanity to ſtile them Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental. Beſides I would fain know of our Author, that if all Laws lye expoſed to an eaſie Abrogation, that are not coaeval with the Kingdom; what will then become of the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> for Liberty of Conſcience, which his Majeſty not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, but undertakes to make irrepealable? And withal may not ſome Laws be as neceſſary to the being and preſervation of a State under the notion of Proteſtant; as others are to its being and ſubſiſtence under the conſideration of an embodied and formed Society? Every Society is bound to uſe all neceſſary means to preſerve it ſelf, and while it maketh no proviſions in order thereunto, that derive inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience upon others, unleſs it be only to keep them from being able to do hurt; it would be a wickedneſs as well as a folly to neglect them. In a word, as the making no Laws neceſſary for the Safety of a people under any knowledge of God they may be grown up into, but what were coaeval with their firſt formation into a Kingdom or Republick, were the weakning and undermining the Security of the Chriſtian Religion in all parts of the world where it hath obtained to be embraced and ſetled; ſo by the ſame reaſon that it is lawful to make proviſions for the preſervation of Chriſtianity in a State profeſſing the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt; it is alſo lawful to make the like proviſions for the Security of the Reformed Religion in theſe Kingdoms and Common-wealths, which have judged it to be their duty to God, and their Souls, to receive and eſtabliſh it. And for our Author's ſaying, that no <hi>Law deſerves to be called Fundamental, ſave that which is to the benefit and advantage of all the Subjects;</hi> it is wholly impertinent to the caſe for which it is alledged, and does no way's attack or weaken what the <hi>Penſionary</hi> had ſaid. For as the Laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for to be maintained, were never ſtiled Fundamental; ſo many thouſands may have benefit by a Law; whom nevertheleſs all perſons of ſenſe and wiſdom will account unfit to be advanced to publick Truſts. As no man will judge it unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to require that all who are held capable of publick employments, ſhould have
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:48501:186"/>ſome degree of wit and underſtanding; ſo I think it is very reaſonable that they ſhould be qualified with ſo much honeſty, as to be well affected to the Government as it is by Law eſtabliſhed. And to ſpeak properly it is not the Law that makes the Papiſts uncapable of Offices and Employments, it only declares they ſhall not be admitted, becauſe they were incapable before, and had made themſelves unfit to be truſted, partly through their dependance upon a forraign power, that is at enmity with the State, and ſeeks to ſubvert it, and partly by reaſon of that principle which they are poſſeſſed with, of its being their duty to deſtroy us whenſoever they can. And as it's a great favour vouchſafed by the Government, to ſuffer ſuch to live under it, as ſtand ſo ill affected to it, and want only means to overthrow it; ſo if the Roman Catholicks will not be content with the firſt without the latter, it will be a great temptation upon the Kingdom to deprive them of the Priviledge they have, becauſe they would not be content with it, unleſs they might obtain that which the Nation could not grant, without being <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> and without abandoning the means both of our ſafety here, and Happineſs hereafter And whereas our Author takes the confidence to tell us, <hi>That there are many States and Cities in</hi> Germany, <hi>where without the giving occaſion to any diſturbance, the Government is ſhared between Papiſts and Proteſtants, and where both thoſe of the Roman Catholick and Reformed Religion, do equally partake in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Truſts and Employments:</hi> He muſt pardon me if I not only ſay, he is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, but that it is a down-right Falſehood, and that herein he betrays his wonted igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or at leaſt gives us a new diſcovery of the inſincerity that is natural to him. Nor would he have vented this in ſo general Terms, but that he did foreſee if he ſhould have condeſcended to particulars, how eaſy it would have been for perſons of very ordinary acquaintance either with Hiſtory or the World, to have both contradicted and refuted him. And if there were ſome one or other ſmall City, where by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Fewneſs of thoſe of one Religion to exerciſe the Government, and to take care of the Welfare of the Society, thoſe of the other Religion are ſometimes received into Employments, in order to prevent the inconveniencies which the want of a competent number of Magiſtrates would be attended with, and where the Jealouſie and Fear of being ſwallowed up by ſome envious and potent Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, may lay them under a neceſſity of agreeing better together than otherwiſe they would or than the principles of ſome of them incline them unto; muſt we thence conclude that it ought to be ſo in a great Kingdom, where there is ſo vaſt a number of Proteſtants admirably qualified with Wiſdom, Intereſt, and Eſtates, to diſcharge all the Offices of the Government, and to manage the univerſal care of the Society, without running the hazard of the many miſchiefs, that would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the taking the Papiſts into partnerſhip with them? Nor could <hi>Mijn Heer Fagel</hi> in repreſenting what is ſafe or unſafe to ſo great and noble a Nation, take notice of what is practiſed upon neceſſity in ſome mean Town or Corporation, (ſuppoſing that it were there as our Author alledgeth) without tranſgreſſing againſt all the Rules both of prudence and decency. But as the <hi>Penſionary</hi> had no where in his <hi>Letter</hi> affirmed, that there were not any States or Cities, in which the Proteſtants and Papiſts bear Office in Government together; but had only ſaid, that Reaſon and Experience do ſhew us, how impoſſible it will be for them when joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in places of Truſt and publick Employments, to maintain a good Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence, and to live peaceably with one another; ſo this is found to be ſo juſt a truth, and ſo pertinently obſerved, that in all the places where it hath been practiſed (tho not in <hi>Germany,</hi> as our Author ignorantly ſuggeſts) they have not only lived in continual heats and diſſentions, but have often come to open Hoſtility againſt each other. Nor hath it meerly fallen out thus in private, and particular States with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelves, but the like evils have often followed and enſued where more States have aſſociated into Union for the common preſervation of the Generality; and where the Government hath been in ſome in the hands of Proteſtants, and in others executed by Roman Catholicks. Of this we have diverſe Examples in the <hi>Cantons</hi> of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> where thro the Magiſtrates being in ſome <hi>Cantons</hi> of the Reformed, and in others of the Roman Catholick Religion, they have not only been often hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from joyning and acting vigorouſly, as they ought to have done, for the intereſt of all, and the benefit of the common Confederation and Union; but they have ſometimes come to open ruptures, and have been embarqued in War againſt one another. And foraſmuch as our Author makes bold to ſay, <hi>That there was never any Chriſtian Kingdom, where the Religion that the Prince profeſſeth, and which had in former ages been. Dominant, was ſo far laid aſide and baniſhed, that his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects profeſſing the ſame with himſelf, were ſhut out and precluded from Truſts and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> I will take the freedom to tell him, that it is ſo groſs and palpable a
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:48501:187"/>Falſehood, that none but a perſon of his ignorance and impudence, would have had the face to have aſſerted it. For there are Chriſtian Kingdoms that have done more than this amounts unto, and who to prevent the danger of having Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts preferred to Truſts and Employments, in caſe a Prince of their Religion ſhould come to the Throne, have been ſo wiſe as to declare Roman Catholicks incapable either of obtaining or keeping the Soveraignty. And it was in the vertue of ſuch a Law, and by reaſon of the dread of it, that <hi>Chriſtina</hi> Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> upon the having taken up a reſolution to turn Papiſt, choſe to demit her Crown before ſhe declared her ſelf, as knowing that immediately after ſuch a Declaration ſhe would have been depoſed from the Throne, and poſſibly not have had ſo liberal an allowance aſſigned her afterwards, as by that conduct ſhe did obtain. Nor is it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to any, except it be to ſuch as our Author is for natural and acquired accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, that there were not only Laws in <hi>Scotland</hi> for precluding a Popiſh Prince from coming to the Government, but that the ſame thing was imployed in the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> as being Oaths of ſuch a frame and nature that it had been moſt incongruous to impoſe them upon Subjects to a King of the Roman Catholick Religion. And tho theſe two Nations did not improve the advantage which they had by means of their legal proviſions, to hinder the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent King from inheriting the Crowns of the reſpective Realms; yet thoſe Laws ſerve to inform us, how far ſome Chriſtian Kingdoms thought it lawful to go, and to what heighth to Act, not only againſt Popiſh Subjects, but againſt Catholick Princes themſelves. Yea the time was, that the very Papiſts were ſo far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the having men of their Religion debarred from Truſts and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Proteſtant Kingdoms under a Popiſh Prince, that they made the <hi>Teſt</hi> Laws by which they are ſhut out from Offices and Declared incapable of them, the great Argument againſt the neceſſity of having the Bill paſſed for excluding the Duke of <hi>York</hi> from the Crown, and improved them as the main Engine for allaying the fears of the Nation, under the apprehenſions they had of his being a Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and coming to the Throne. But by their different Language now from what it was then, all Engliſhmen underſtand how far they are to be believed in other caſes: and whether the many promiſes which they do make at this time, in order to a further deſign, and the putting a new Trick upon the Nation, ought to be depended on by them whom they have already deceived. And whereas upon <hi>Mijn Heer Fagel's</hi> having obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the conduct of Roman Catholicks is much more ſevere towards Proteſtants, than that of thoſe of the Reformed Religion towards Papiſts, our Author is pleaſed to reply, <hi>that in order to judge as we ſhould of that different procedure, we are to conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not leſs juſt, to baniſh a Religion that had been ſo long dominant as the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick had been; than to withſtand the introduction of a new Religion that would depreſs and ſupplant the old.</hi> All I ſhall ſay in reference to this, is that as it does not weaken, but in effect acknowledge what the <hi>Penſionary</hi> had ſaid; ſo by juſtifying what the Papiſts did, to prevent the bringing in of the Proteſtant Religion, which he ſtiles new; he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warns us what we are to expect they will be ready to do, for the reintroducing the Papal Religion, to which he gives the character of old. Nor is it at all pertinent to the preſent caſe, which of the Religions is the oldeſt, or which is the neweſt; but all contended for is that the method's of the one, have been, and ſtill are, more ſevere and ſanguinary, than the methods of thoſe of the other. And as we believe our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be as ancient, as Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles; ſo no preſcription of time for Popery's having been in poſſeſſion, can deprive that which has the Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to warrant it, from a right of re-entrance.</p>
            <p>There remains only one thing to be ſpoken unto, of all that I undertook to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and correct our Author for, and that is the ſignal ingratitude of the Papiſts, and particularly of this Gentleman, to their Highneſſes, for all that Liberty, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and eaſe which Their Highneſſes were willing to have had allowed unto them. And that we may the more fully have an Idea of their unthankfulneſs, we are to conſider both the extent of that Liberty which Their Highneſſes were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to have had beſtowed upon them, and the obligations they would have come under for the rendring it hereafter inviolable. And all this not only at a ſeaſon, when many of the Papiſts carry it ſo undutifully towards their Highneſſes, but at a time when they of the Reformed Religion are ſo unhumanely perſecuted by ſeveral Popiſh Princes in other parts of the world. It had not been an unreaſonable deſire that before the Papiſts had been ſo importunate to have all Penal Laws againſt them in Proteſtant Nations reſcinded and taken away; that they ſhould have declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and improved their intereſt, for the Abrogation of all ſuch Laws as are in force againſt thoſe of the Reformed Religion in Popiſh Countries. And if their Highneſſes
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:48501:187"/>had inſiſted upon ſuch a ſtipulation, before They would have given their conſent for the Repeal of the Penal Laws againſt Roman Catholicks in <hi>England,</hi> it had been no more than what was agreeable to the Rules of Wiſdom and Juſtice. But their High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes not thinking it fit to ſuffer their own mercy to be reſtrained by reaſon of the want of Chriſtian bowels in others, took the firſt opportunity put into their hands, of teſtifying their readineſs to conſent to the Repeal of all thoſe Laws againſt Papiſts in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> by which they are made liable to fines or other puniſhments. And that thoſe which they can not agree to the reſcinding of, are only ſuch by which the Reformed Religion is covered from the deſigns of the Roman Catholicks againſt it, and by which they are reſtrained from getting into a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to overturn it. One would think that this ſhould have been received as a moſt ſpecial favour, and have obliged them to very hearty acknowledgments. Eſpecially when the Prince and Princeſs were willing to confirm both this and a Liberty for the private Exerciſe of their Religion with their Guaranty. But in ſtead of any ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of gratitude, there is nothing to be heard of from many of them, or to be met with in our Anſwerer, but what proclaims their diſſatisfaction, anger, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. For beſides all the ill returns, we have already taken notice of in this wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and unthankful man; he tells us, that all which Their Highneſſes declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ready to conſent unto amounts only <hi>to the aboliſhing ſome cruel Laws, by which Romiſh Eccleſiaſticks ſtood condemned to death, for no other reaſon ſave their being Prieſts; and in the vertue of which, other perſons were baniſhed and deprived of their Eſtates, meerly for being Roman Catholicks; all which was a higher degree of barbarity than was ever pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed among the moſt ſalvage Nations.</hi> Now not to trouble my ſelf about what kind of entertainment, Romiſh Prieſts and Lay Papiſts have met with among thoſe Nations, which our Author ſtiles Barbarous, tho it will be found infinitely more ſevere, than any thing that was ever inflicted upon them in <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> by reaſon of their Religion, or upon the ſcore of any Eccleſiaſtical Character: I would only know of this modeſt and veracious Gentleman, what he thinks of the barbarous and innumerable Cruelties, that were perpetrated in all ages and places heretofore, and which are at this day committed upon peaceable and ſincere Chriſtians, for no other crime but that they could not, and to this day cannot believe as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth, nor continue in Communion with ſo idolatrous and villanous a Society. Whatſoever meaſure of ſeverity hath been any where exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed towards Papiſts, it was but according to the Preſident themſelves had ſet, in their dealing with them whom they ſtile Hereticks, and in which the Copy comes vaſtly below the Original. But then that which wholly alters the caſe, is, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Papiſts perſecute and deſtroy Chriſtians, meerly upon the account of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; there were never any ſevere, much leſs Sanguinary Laws enacted againſt them, ſave by reaſon of their Crimes againſt the State, and for being Enemies and Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to the Government. Popery was never perſecuted in <hi>England</hi> as it is a falſe and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Belief; but as it binds men to the owning of a forraign, uſurped, and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Jurisdiction. 'Tis neither for their believing Tranſubſtantiation, nor for their Worſhipping Images, that Papiſts are adjudged to penalties or death; but becauſe they adhere to a forreign Enemy, and are treacherous to their Countrey. Could they have been but good Subjects; their being bad Chriſtians would never have preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced them. And indeed while they continue to hold that the Pope can depoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Soveraigns, and abſolve Subjects from their Allegiance to them, and that it is lawful to cut the Throats of all whom they ſtile Hereticks, and that all Laws made for our ſecurity are null and void, as being enacted by an incompetent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Authority, it would ſeem according to the exact meaſures of wiſdom and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that all lenity and favour towards them, were not only a ſupererogating in Mercy, but an indiſcretion in Policy. But then to let ſuch into the Government, were plainly to betray the State, and wilfully to abandon both it and our ſelves to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed and ruined. Nor is there ſo much danger in advancing Robbers and Newgate Fellons to Employments, as there would be in preferring Papiſts, eſpecially if Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiced and Bigotted, into Civil Offices in a Reformed Kingdom. And therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they will not thankfully accept and quietly acquieſce in what is offered, and that rather from an exurberancy of Generoſity and Mercy, than from Maxims of prudence, and obligations ariſing from duty; it is beſt to leave them, to ſteer their own courſe, and to purſue thoſe Methods, which will infallibly iſſue in their diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, to ſay no worſe. All ways of Gentleneſs and Moderation towards them, do on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encourage their making the bolder claims, and the proceeding further in their uſurpations. The giving them an inch, provokes them to take an ell, and they grow enraged becauſe we will not tamely ſuffer it. If they act as they do, while the Chain
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:48501:188"/>hangs ſtill about their necks? what are we to expect if it ſhould be wholly taken off, &amp; they left looſe to exert the malignity which their Religion inſpires them with? For not being contented to invade and uſurp all ſorts of Employments and places of Truſt in defiance of the <hi>Teſt</hi> Laws; they have aſſumed that confidence, as to make thoſe very Laws which were intentionally enacted and deſigned to keep Papiſts out of Office and Power, the ground and occaſion of incapacitating and ſhutting out Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. And whereas none are by Law to be admitted into Employments without making the Declarations contained in the <hi>Teſts;</hi> none are now to be continued, ſave they who ſhall both refuſe to take them, and withal promiſe to give their votes for the Election of ſuch perſons into Parliament, as ſhall be willing to Abrogate and Repeal them. Which is not only ſuch a piece of Chicannery in it ſelf, but ſuch an Aſſault upon the Legiſlative Authority, that it is hard to ſpeak of it, without more than uſual emotion of mind, and the having ones indignation ſtrangely excited and enflamed. However all I ſhall allow my ſelf at preſent to ſay, ſhall be only to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe all ſort of perſons to take care what they do, there being no Diſpenſing power lodged in the King, in reference to <hi>Penal,</hi> and much leſs in relation to the <hi>Teſt</hi> Laws. Of this we have a clear and uncontrollable proof in the proceedings of the Parliament 1673. when the Houſe of Commons voted the Declaration of the late King for Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conſcience, to be both a violation of the Laws of the Land, and an altering of the Legiſlative power. Which is the more remarkable, in that it was not only done by the moſt obſequious Parliament that ever any King of <hi>England</hi> had, and of which many of the Members were his hired and brib'd <hi>Penſioners,</hi> but that they did thus adjudge, both after the King had acquainted them by a ſolemn Speech at the opening of the Seſſion, that he was Reſolved to adhere to his Declaration, and had endeavoured to <hi>Hector</hi> them into a departure from their Vote, by telling them in an Anſwer which he made to one of their Addreſſes, that they had queſtioned a power in the Crown, which had never been diſputed in the Reign of any of his Predeceſſors, and which belonged unto him as a prerogative inſeparable from the Soveraignty. Yet notwithſtanding both all this, and his applying himſelf in a Speech to the Houſe of Lords to have engaged them to ſtand by him againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, he was neceſſitated upon the Commons inſiſting, that there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any ſuch Diſpenſing power veſted in the Crown, nor claimed or exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by any of his Predeceſſors; and that the aſſuming it was a changing of the Conſtitution, and an altering of the Legiſlative Authority; and upon the Lords declining to ſtand by him, and their adviſing him to give liberty by way of Bill to be paſſed into a Law; I ſay he was neceſſitated to take his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration off from the File, tear the Seal from it, and to aſſure both Houſes in a Speech he made to them, <hi>March</hi> 8. that what he had done in taking upon him to Suſpend the Penal Laws, ſhould not for the future be drawn either into conſequence or Example. In brief, if the Papiſts will not ſo far conſult their own intereſt, and comply with our ſafety, as to be contented with an eaſe from Penalties, and an Indulgence to be ratified into a Law for the private exerciſe of their Religion; it is the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable duty of all Proteſtants, of what party or perſwaſion ſoever they be, to unite together in withſtanding their endeavours and attempts for obtaining more. We have a laudable example in the carriage of all that pretended to Chriſtianity, when they were brought into a condition ſomewhat parallel with ours in one of the firſt Centuries. For tho the Orthodox had been perſecuted by the <hi>Arrians</hi> under <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Arrians</hi> harſhly enough treated at leaſt, as they thought for a while under <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> yet upon <hi>Julian</hi>'s coming to the Throne, both parties were ſo far from embracing his offers in order to revenge their wrongs upon one another, that they reſolved at that ſeaſon if not wholly to ſilence their Diſputes, yet to forbear all thoſe harſh Terms, that had enflamed their heats and animoſities. To which I ſhall add but this one thing more, and would beg of the Diſſenters, that they may ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider it, namely that as the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> were the only party of Chriſtians that made Addreſſes to <hi>Julian,</hi> and received favours from him; ſo they thereby became infamous, and were often afterwards reproached with it.</p>
            <p>Thus Sir, I have ſtudyed to do what you required of me, and if it be my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune not to have acquitted my ſelf anſwerably to your expectations; yet the doing it as well, as the being bound up to an Author, that adminiſters ſo little occaſion for valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thoughts, would allow, gives me the ſatisfaction of having approved my ſelf,</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have, at laſt, procured a ſight of the Book, ſtiled, <hi>Good Advice to the Church of England, Roman Catholick and Proteſtant Diſſenter;</hi> and of the <hi>Three Letters from a Gentleman in the Countrey to his Friend in London;</hi> which, as they are written by one and the ſame perſon, ſo he endeavours, in all of them, to make it appear to be the <hi>Duty, Principles,</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the parties mentioned, to <hi>Aboliſh the Penal Laws</hi> and <hi>Teſts.</hi> Now though I'm daily in expectation of ſeeing ſuch an Anſwer returned to thoſe Papers, as will both give the Author cauſe to wiſh he had been otherways imploy'd when he wrote them, and make the Court-Faction aſham'd of the Elogies they have heapt upon him for his ſervice; yet it may not be amiſs in the mean time, to ſhew, in a very few Pages, that 'tis not any conſiderable ſtrength in thoſe Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which hath given them a Reputation, but the Intereſt of ſome to have every thing accounted unanſwerable that is publiſhed in favour of their Deſigns, and the folly and weakneſs of others, which makes them believe that to be nervous, in whoſe ſucceſs they imagine their caſe to be wrapt up and involved.</p>
            <p>I think it is univerſally acknowledged, and I'm ſure it can be demonſtratively pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that they are written by a <hi>Quaker;</hi> and this ought to render us jealous both of the motives influencing unto it, and of the end to which they are deſigned to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient. For <hi>firſt,</hi> the affinity of ſeveral of the <hi>Religious Principles</hi> of that <hi>party,</hi> with ſome of the material <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> may, notwithſtanding the Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which we retain towards the Bulk of them, make us juſtly apprehenſive, that one or more of their Leaders are intirely in the Intereſt of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> For as the Popiſh Emiſſaries know how to put themſelves into all ſhapes, for the increaſing and height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning diviſions among <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and for the expoſing as well as ſupplanting of our Religion; ſo the deſign promoted in the foreſaid Papers, of deſtroying all the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Fences</hi> againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> and of letting the <hi>Papiſts</hi> into the <hi>Legiſlative</hi> and whole <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive</hi> Power of the Government, gives the World too much ground to ſuſpect out of whoſe mint and forge writings of this ſtamp and mettle do proceed? <hi>Secondly,</hi> It ſhould not a little contribute to augment our Jealouſie, that they who without being falſe to their Religious Tenets, cannot joyn to aſſiſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> in caſe the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſhould attempt to cut our Throats, or endeavour to impoſe their Religion upon the Nation by <hi>Military</hi> force; ſhould, of all men, ſtudy to overthrow that Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity which we have, by the <hi>Teſt</hi> Laws, whoſe whole tendency is onely to prevent the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> from getting into a condition to extirpate our Religion, and deſtroy us. Is it not enough that they have rob'd the Kingdom of the Aid of ſo many as they have leavened with their Doctrine, in caſe the King, upon deſpairing to eſtabliſh <hi>Popery</hi> by a <hi>Parliament,</hi> ſhould imploy his <hi>Janizaries</hi> to compel us to receive it, and ſhould ſet upon the converting <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> in the way that the <hi>French Monarch</hi> hath converted the <hi>Huguenots;</hi> but that over and above this, they ſhould be doing all they can, to deprive us of all the Legal Security, whereby we may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from the Power of the Papiſts? Surely 'twere not Charity and good Nature, but ſtupidity and folly, not to ſuſpect the tendency of ſuch a deſign, when we find it purſued and carried on by a perſon that ſtiles himſelf a <hi>Quaker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then, when beſides this, we find that 'tis <hi>Mr. William Pen,</hi> who is the <hi>Author</hi> of thoſe <hi>Papers,</hi> and the great Inſtrument in advancing this projection, we have the more cauſe to ſuſpect ſome ſiniſtrous thing at the bottom of it. For <hi>firſt,</hi> he is under thoſe Obligations to His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> which, as they may put a biaſs upon his Underſtanding, ſo they afford ground enough to <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to look upon him no otherways than as one Retained againſt them. 'Twas through his preſent <hi>Majeſties</hi> Interceſſion with the late King, that he obtained the <hi>Proprietorſhip</hi> of <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> and from his Bounty that he had the <hi>Propriety</hi> of <hi>Three</hi> whole <hi>Counties</hi> bordering upon it ſuperadded thereunto. And as this cannot be but a ſtrong Obligation upon ſo grateful a perſon as <hi>Mr. Pen,</hi> why he ſhould effectually ſerve the King, and make his Will, in a very great degree, the meaſure of his actings; ſo it ought to be an Inducement to others to be the more jealous of all he ſay's, and not to ſurrender themſelves too eaſily either to his <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial</hi> Dictates upon the one hand, or to his ſmooth Flatteries upon the other. He muſt have either laid a mighty merit upon the two Royal Brothers, of both whoſe Religion we are at laſt convinced, or he muſt have come under Obligations, of doing them very
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:48501:189"/>conſiderable ſervice, in reference to that which they were moſt fond of compaſſing; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways we have little cauſe to think, that he would have been ſingled out from all the reſt of the Kingdom, to be made the object of ſo ſpecial favour, and of ſo eminent li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality. For though there might be a debt owing to his Father Sir <hi>William Pen,</hi> yet they muſt be extreamly weak, who conceive there was no other motive to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Donation, ſave Honour and Juſtice in the two Royal Brothers, for having it diſcharged. Seeing many of the nobleſt Families in <hi>England,</hi> who had ſpent their Blood, and waſted their Eſtates in fighting for the Crown, while Sir <hi>William Pen</hi> was all along ingaged againſt it, were not only left without all kind of Compenſation, for what they had eminently acted, and as eminently ſuffered in behalf of the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> but could never get to be reimburſed one farthing of the vaſt Sums, which they had lent the late King and his Father upon the ſecurity of the Royal Faith. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pen</hi> hath too far detected himſelf in theſe very Diſcourſes, not to give us ground to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect what they are calculated for, and whereunto they are ſubſervient. For beſides his juſtifying the King's turning ſo many Gentlemen of the Church of <hi>England</hi> out of all Office and Imploy, by ſaying, <hi>they are not fit to be truſted, who are out of the King's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt;</hi> he further tells us, that <hi>the King being mortal, it is not good ſenſe, that he ſhould leave the power in thoſe hands, that to his face ſhew their averſion to the Friends of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. (Letter firſt.)</hi> For as this implies no leſs, than that they ought to have the whole Legal and Military Power of the <hi>three Kingdoms</hi> put into their hands, that they may be in a condition to preclude the right Heir from Succeſſion to the Crown, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe ſuch Laws to her as they pleaſe, in caſe they ſhould think fit to admit her; ſo a very ſmall meaſure of Underſtanding, will ſerve to inſtruct us, what the <hi>Papiſts</hi> eſteem to be an <hi>averſion</hi> to them, and in what manner, had they the power in their hands, they think themſelves obliged to treat us upon that account. And as we have had occaſion to know too much of his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Temper and Deſign, as well as to whoſe Guidance he hath implicitely reſigned himſelf, not to be ſenſible what he eſteems his <hi>Intereſt;</hi> ſo we need no other evidence what it amounts unto <hi>to be in it,</hi> than the ſeeing ſo many diſplaced from all ſhare in the adminiſtration, whoſe Quality gives them a Right, and their Abilities a fitneſs for the chiefeſt and moſt honourable Truſts; and whom as the King, by reaſon of their ſervices to himſelf as well as the <hi>Crown,</hi> cannot lay aſide with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the higheſt ingratitude; ſo their known Loyalty to his perſon, and zeal for the grandure of the <hi>Monarchy</hi> is ſuch, that nothing could take them off from concurring in his Councils, and promoting his Deſigns, but the conviction they are under, of their tendency to the ſubverſion of Religion, and the altering of the Legal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And as we have reaſon to ſuſpect what the foreſaid Papers are intended to promote, both upon the account of the <hi>Author</hi>'s being <hi>Quaker,</hi> and becauſe not onely of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Obligations he is under to His Majeſty, but his being ſo intirely in his Intereſt, as appears by his influence into Councils, the great ſtroke he hath in all Affairs, and from his being one of the King's principal Confidents; ſo upon looking into thoſe Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, we find ſeveral things obtruded on us for truth, and propoſed in order to whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and inſnare us into an abrogation of the Laws enacted for our ſecurity, which to every ones knowledge are ſo palpably falſe, that we have all the ground that may be, both to queſtion and ſuſpect his ſincerity, and to conclude, that his Maſters do not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to confine themſelves within the bounds that he is pleaſed to chalk out for them; and which he undertakes they ſhall be contented with for their allotment. For what can be remoter from Truth? than that the <hi>Teſt Laws were deſigned as a preamble to the Bill of Excluſion,</hi> (as he phraſes it, <hi>Letter firſt)</hi> and that <hi>they were contrived to exclude the Duke of York from the Crown,</hi> (as he expreſſeth it, <hi>p.</hi> 15. <hi>of his Good Advice,</hi> &amp;c.) when it is moſt certain, that as the <hi>Teſt</hi> in 73. was made long before there were, or could be any thoughts of it, and was enacted by a Parliament againſt whoſe Loyalty there can be no exception; ſo there was a clauſe in the laſt <hi>Teſt</hi> Act, by which it was provided, that he ſhould not be obliged to take it. Again, what can be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to experience, than that <hi>the King onely deſires eaſe for thoſe of his Religion;</hi> (Good Adv. p. 44.) and that the <hi>Papiſts deſire no more than a Toleration,</hi> and are willing upon <hi>thoſe Terms, to make a perpetual peace with the Church of England,</hi> (Good Advice, <hi>p.</hi> 17.) For do we not daily ſee Proteſtants turned out of all Places of Truſt, Authority and Command; and Papiſts advanced into all Offices Military and Civil; Could the King have been contented with a Non-execution of the Laws againſt thoſe of his Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and could they have been ſatisfied with ſuch an Indulgence, and have modeſtly improved it? 'Tis not improbable but that ſuch a behaviour, would have ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon the ingenuity and good nature of the generality of Proteſtants, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out needing to have been importuned, they would have repealed all the <hi>Penal Laws</hi>
               <pb n="365" facs="tcp:48501:189"/>againſt <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi> But the methods which have been purſued by his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and them, ſhews, both that they aim at no leſs than the Domination, and that we muſt be very willing to be deceived, if we either credit Mr. <hi>Pen,</hi> or ſuffer our ſelves to be influenced by him, after his obtruding upon us for truths, matters, which our very ſenſes inable us to refute. It may juſtly make us queſtion his ſincerity, and beget a ſuſpition in all thinking people, of the ſiniſtrous deſign theſe <hi>Papers</hi> are adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto, when we find him endeavouring to cajole the Nation to an abrogation of the Laws, by which our Religion and Safety are ſecured, by telling us. That <hi>the King's word is enough for us to rely upon,</hi> if they were gone, (<hi>Good Advice,</hi> p. 49.) and <hi>that he could eaſily pack a Parliament for Repealing them, if he did not ſeek a more laſting and more agreeable ſecurity to his Friends,</hi> (<hi>Letter third,</hi> p. 12.) and that if they were aboliſhed, <hi>'tis below the Glory of our King, to uſe ways ſo unlike the reſt of his open and generous principles, as to endeavour to get a</hi> Parliament <hi>afterwards returned, that is not duly choſen</hi> (<hi>Letter ſecond,</hi> p. 15.) and that <hi>he is a Prince of that Honour, Conſcience and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroas nature, as not by invading the Rights of the Church of England, to become guilty of an injustice and irreligion, he hath ſo often, ſo ſolemnly and earneſtly ſpoken againſt</hi> (<hi>Letter ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi> p. 11.) He muſt needs take us to be ſtrangely unacquainted with the whole Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the <hi>King</hi>'s Actings in <hi>England,</hi> as well as in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of very weak underſtandings, and of an eaſie belief, if he think we are to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon, and decoy'd by ſuch Topicks as theſe, to abſoliſh the <hi>Tests:</hi> or that after what we have ſeen and felt contradictory to thoſe <hi>Panegyricks,</hi> and inconſiſtent with thoſe beautiful and lofty Characters faſtned upon his Majeſty, we ſhould believe Mr. <hi>Pen</hi> to mean nothing but well and honeſtly towards the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Intereſt, in what he ſo earneſtly ſolliciteth the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the Diſſenters in the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Papers</hi> to concurr and conſent unto.</p>
            <p>I do acknowledge, that what he hath ſaid about Liberty, due to men in matters of meer Religion, and by way of rebuke unto, and reflection upon the Wiſdom and Juſtice of thoſe, that either are, or have been for perſecution, is very ſtrong and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing; but I muſt withall add, that it is all at this time very needleſs and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. For the Church of <hi>England</hi> is ſo ſenſible of the Iniquity, as well as folly of that Method, that there is no ground to ſuſpect She will ever be guilty of it for the future. They, whom no Arguments could heretofore convert, the Court (whoſe Tools they were in that miſchievous and Unchriſtian work, and by whom they were inſtigated to all the ſeverities which they are now blamed for) by objecting it to them as their Reproach and Diſgrace, and by ſeeking to improve the reſentments of thoſe who had ſuffered by Penal Laws, to become an united party with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> for their ſubverſion, hath brought them at once to be aſham'd of what they did, and to Reſolutions of promoting all Chriſtian Liberty for the time to come. And ſhould there be any peeviſh and ill-natur'd Eccleſiaſticks, who, upon a turn of Affairs, would be ready to reaſſume their former principles, and purſue their wonted courſe; we may be ſecure againſt all fear of their being ſucceſsful in it, not only by finding the Majority as well as the more learned, both of the dignified and inferior Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, unchangeably fixed and determined againſt it, but by having the whole Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Gentry, and thoſe Noble Princes whoſe right it will be next to aſcend the Throne, fully poſſeſſed with all the generous and Chriſtian purpoſes we can deſire, of making proviſion for Liberty of Conſcience by a Law. Nor can I forbear to ſubjoyn how ſurprizing it ought to be to all <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that while Mr. <hi>Pen</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth ſo much charity for the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> he entertaineth ſo little for the Church of <hi>England.</hi> He would perſwade us, that if the <hi>Penal</hi> and <hi>Teſt Laws</hi> were abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> would be ſo far afterward from ſeeking to ſhake the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> or from breaking in upon the Liberty that is now vouchſafed unto Diſſenters, or from endeavouring to make their Religion National; that they would not onely be <hi>contented with a bare Toleration,</hi> but that upon their enjoyment of eaſe by Law, <hi>they would turn good Countrymen, and come in to the Intereſt of the Kingdom, (Letter firſt.)</hi> Whereas at the ſame time, he would have us believe, that all the Proteſtations of thoſe in the Communion of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> for exerciſing Moderation in time to come, are but the <hi>Language of their fear, that their promiſes are not to be truſted,</hi> (<hi>Good Advice,</hi> p. 54.) and that <hi>the Diſſenters deſerve to be begged for Fools,</hi> ſhould they be ſatisfied with any leſs aſſurance, <hi>than the abolition of the Penal and Teſt Laws,</hi> (<hi>ibid. p.</hi> 55.) 'Tis enough, not onely to excite our Jealouſie, but to ſtir up ſeverer paſſions, to be told at a ſeaſon when we know what the Catholicks are doing in <hi>France,</hi> and in moſt other places where they have any power, that the <hi>Papiſts through ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving burnt their fingers with perſecution, may be grown ſo wiſe as to do ſo no more;</hi>
               <pb n="366" facs="tcp:48501:190"/>and yet to have it aſſerted in the ſame Page, that they who can be prevailed upon to believe, <hi>that the Church of England is ſorry for what She hath done, and that ſhe will not be guilty of ſuch a thing again, have little reaſon to quarrel at the unaccount a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> (<hi>Good Advice,</hi> p. 8.) Nor is it becoming one who ſtiles himſelf a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> no more than it is conſiſtent with Truth, to extenuate our <hi>being ſcandal'd at the ſeverity upon Proteſtants in France, by affirming, that he can parallel ſome of the ſevereſt paſſages in that Kingdom, out of the Actions of ſome Members of the Church of England in cool Blood,</hi> (<hi>ibid.</hi> p. 7.) And though I have all the kindneſs imaginable for Mr. <hi>Pen</hi>'s Perſon, and am loath to think otherways of him, as to his Religious Principles, than as his avowed profeſſion diſcovers him; yet theſe, and diverſe paſſages more of that kind, together with the acceſſion he muſt neceſſarily have had to the apprehenſion and impriſonment of Mr. <hi>Gray.</hi> &amp;c. for abandoning the <hi>Benedictine Order;</hi> are things I can neither reconcile to the title he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes, nor to his many Diſcourſes for Repealing the <hi>Teſt</hi> Laws. And to ſpeak freely, conſidering the Nature of our Laws againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and that it was their manifold Treaſons, and onely our care to preſerve our ſelves, that both gave the firſt riſe unto them, and has neceſſitated their continuance; I know neither how to conſtrue that Aſſertion of Mr. <hi>Pen</hi>'s (Good Advice, <hi>p.</hi> 13.) that the <hi>Principle which the Church of England acts by, juſtifies the King of France and the Inquiſition;</hi> nor that other, <hi>(Letter firſt) of there having been eight times more Laws made for ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men for their Conſcience, ſince the Church of England came to be the National Eſtabliſhment, than were all the time that Popery was in the Chair.</hi> Nor can this be deſigned to any other end, but the giving the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> the commendation of Mercy and Moderation above a <hi>Proteſtant Church.</hi> For as 'tis certain, that the <hi>one Law</hi> of Burning and Extirpating Hereticks, was a thouſand fold worſe, and hath produced infinitely more Sanguinary effects, than all the Laws and Rigours that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> can be charged with; ſo there is nothing can be falſer, than that either her Principle, or Practice, do parallel or juſtifie the barbarous and brutal ſeverities of the <hi>French King,</hi> and the <hi>Inquiſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, were all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> agreed, that Liberty, in meer matters of Religion, ſhould be immediately granted in a Legal way; yet I do not ſee how the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſhould pretend to any benefit by it, or be able to lay a juſt claim to a ſhare in it. So that the foundation which Mr. <hi>Pen</hi> goes upon, of mens having a Right to be indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in matters of Religion, is too narrow to ſupport the ſtructure he raiſeth upon it. For though there may be ſome things retained in <hi>Popery,</hi> which may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led matters of Religion; yet in the bulk and complex of it, it is a Conjuration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Religion, and a Conſpiracy againſt the Peace of Societies, and the Rights of Mankind. 'Tis one of the Crimes, as well as the Miſeries of this Age, that out of a dread of ſome, and in complacence to others, we have avoided repreſenting <hi>Popery</hi> in its native colours, and calling it by the Names properly due unto it. But I have always thought, that 'tis better fail in our Courtſhip to Men, than in our duty to God, and fidelity to the Intereſt of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the ſafety of Mankind. Nor do I doubt but that they will be better approved in the Great day of Account, who Character Perſons, Doctrines and Practices as the Scripture doth, than they, who that they may accommodate themſelves unto, and be acceptable with the world, ſpeak of them in a ſofter ſtile. Now if either Blaſphemies againſt God, or Tyrannies over Men; if either the defacing the <hi>Ideas</hi> of a Deity, or corrupting the Principles of Vertue, and Moral Honeſty; if either the ſubverting the foundations of natural <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> or the overthrowing the moſt eſſential Articles of the Chriſtian Faith; if either the moſt avowed and bold affronts offered to heaven, or the bloodieſt and moſt bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal outrages executed againſt the beſt of men; if all theſe be ſufficient to preclude a party from the benefit of Liberty due to people in <hi>Religious</hi> Matters, I am ſure, none have reaſon to challenge it in behalf of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> nor cauſe to complain, if it be denied them. Can there be any thing more unreaſonable, than that they ſhould claim a <hi>Toleration</hi> in a <hi>Proteſtant State,</hi> whoſe Principles not only allow, but oblige them to deſtroy us, as ſoon as their power inables them to do it? Is not the Doctrine of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Supremacy, and his having a <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>Depoſe Kings,</hi> and abſolve Subjects from their Allegiance, together with that of breaking Faith to Hereticks, and the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all thoſe who cannot believe as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth, mighty inducements to thoſe whom they have baptized with that Name, and to whom they long to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe that courteſie, for the <hi>Repealing</hi> of the <hi>Penal</hi> and <hi>Teſt Laws</hi> againſt <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts?</hi> Nor are theſe Principles falſely charged upon them, but they are the Oracular Deciſions of their General <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Popes,</hi> whom they ſtile Infallible. So that Mr. <hi>Pen</hi>'s <hi>Book</hi> and <hi>Letters,</hi> which ſeem to have been written not ſo much in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:48501:190"/>of Diſſenting <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as of <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> can little advantage the latter, even allowing the Principle which he goes upon, and admitting all he hath ſaid for Mens Right to Liberty in meer matters of Religion, to be unanſwerable. And his telling us (<hi>Good Adv.</hi> p. 42.) <hi>that Violence and Tyranny are not natural conſequences of Popery,</hi> does onely diſcover his kindneſs to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the little Friendſhip and care he hath for the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Intereſt. For we know both the Principles of their Religion too well, and have at all times experienced, and do at this day feel the effects of them too ſenſibly, to be deluded by this kind of Sophiſtry, and impoſed upon by ſo palpable a Falſehood, to abandon the means of our ſafety. Whereſoever any <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Rulers</hi> Act with Gentleneſs and Moderation towards thoſe whom their Church hath declared <hi>Hereticks;</hi> 'tis either becauſe there are Political Reaſons for it, as might be eaſily ſhewed in reference to all thoſe States and Governments which he mentions, or becauſe there are ſome Princes of the <hi>Roman Communion,</hi> in whom the Dictates of Humane Nature are more prevalent than thoſe of their Religion.</p>
            <p>But ſhould the gentle Temper of the Engliſh Nation, ſway them beyond the ſtrict obligations of duty, and make them willing to Repeal the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> againſt <hi>Papiſts;</hi> yet to do it in their preſent Circumſtances, and at ſuch a conjuncture as this, were the higheſt act of folly in the world, and a betraying both their own ſafety and that of their Religion. Had the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> forbore to aſſume a liberty till it had been legally given them; they had been the more capable objects of ſuch a Grace; but to beſtow it upon them after they have in contempt and defiance of all our Laws taken it, 'twere to juſtify their uſurpation, and approve their crime. Could they have been contented with the private practice of their Worſhip, and the non-exaction of the penalties to which our Statutes make them liable, without leaping into all Offices of Truſt and Command, and invading our Seats of Judicature, our Churches, and our Univerſities; their modeſty might have wrought much upon the generoſity and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of all ſort of Proteſtants; but their audacious wreſting all power into their hands, and their laying aſide all thoſe that have either any zeal for our Civil Rights, or for the Proteſtant <hi>Religion,</hi> is enough to kindle our further indignation, in ſtead of influencing us to thoughts of moderation and lenity. And ſhould we once begin to cancel our Laws, according to the meaſure and proportion, that they break them and uſurp upon them, no man can tell where that will terminate; and they will be ſure to turn it into an encouragement to further attempts. For having, in compliance with their Impudence, and to abſolve them from the guilt of their Crimes and Treaſons, abrogated the Laws againſt Popery; they will not fail, in a little while, to betake themſelves to the ſame Methods, for obtaining the abolition of all the Laws for Proteſtancy. 'Tis but for the King to declare, that he will have all his Subjects to be of his own <hi>Religion;</hi> and then by the Logick of the late Cant, which he uſed in his Speech to the Council at <hi>Windſor, That they who are not for him, are againſt him;</hi> we muſt immediately either turn Papiſts, or be put into the ſame Liſt with them, and be thought worthy of the ſame <hi>Royal Diſpleaſure,</hi> which they are become obnoxious unto, who cannot find it to be their duty and intereſt to deſtroy the <hi>Teſts.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Pen</hi>'s Argument of <hi>being afraid of His Majeſties and the Papists power, and yet to provoke it,</hi> (Good Advice, <hi>p.</hi> 43.) will hold in the one caſe as well as in the other. Nor do I ſee but that the Court may improve another Topick of his againſt us (<hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 44.) viz. That we <hi>were ill Courtiers by ſetting him up, firſt to give him Roaſt-meat, and then to beat him with the Spit,</hi> by refuſing to be of his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> To which I may add, that the brutal ſeverities exerciſed towards Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Piedmont,</hi> are but ill inducements to prevail upon a <hi>Reformed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to give Liberty to Papiſts. 'Tis an Axiom founded in the light of Nature, as well as an Oracle of Revelation, <hi>That with what meaſure any do mete unto others, it ſhall be meaſured to them again; and that whatſoever any would that we ſhould do to them, they ſhould do ſo to us.</hi> Would the Papiſts once perſwade Catholick Rulers to give Indulgence to thoſe of our <hi>Religion;</hi> it would be an argument that they acted ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their pleading againſt <hi>Penal Laws</hi> for matters of <hi>Religion;</hi> and would mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevail upon all of the <hi>Reformed Communion</hi> to <hi>Repeal</hi> ſuch <hi>Statutes</hi> as are Enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt them. But while they continue and increaſe their Perſecution againſt us in all places where they have power; I do not ſee how they can reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that we ſhould believe them either to be juſt or honeſt, or to deſerve any meaſure of lenity. <hi>Reprizals</hi> are the onely methods, whereby to bring them to peaceable and equal Terms. Had Proteſtant Princes and States, given Papal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns to underſtand, that they would act upon the ſame ſquare that they do; and retaliate upon thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Faith, whatſoever ſhould be inflicted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of <hi>Religion</hi> upon thoſe of ours; I have ground to think that the <hi>Clergy</hi> in <hi>France</hi>
               <pb n="368" facs="tcp:48501:191"/>and <hi>Savoy,</hi> would have had more diſcretion, than to have been Inſtrumental in ſtirring up the late Perſecutions, and of inſtigating Rulers to ſuch unparallelled Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barities. 'Tis not many years ſince a Prince in <hi>Germany</hi> begun to treat <hi>Proteſtants</hi> with an unjuſt ſeverity, and to Baniſh them his Countrey, contrary to his word and the Stipulation he had made with them; but upon the Duke of <hi>Brandenburg's</hi> both threatning and beginning to do ſo by the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> in his Dutchy of <hi>Cleve,</hi> the other Prince immediately forbare his rigour, and the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> had fair Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter allowed them. And therefore if Mr. <hi>Pen</hi> and his Catholick Friends, in ſtead of reproaching the Church of England <hi>of juſtifying by her principle the King of France and the Inquiſition,</hi> would prevail for aboliſhing the one, and for putting an end to Perſecution by the other, they would thereby do more for inclining the Nations to Tolerate Papiſts, than either by all their invidious <hi>Satyrs</hi> againſt the conformable Clergy, or by their <hi>Panegyricks</hi> upon a Popiſh Monarch and the Romiſh Church. In the mean time, 'tis moſt unreaſonable for them to demand or expect, and unwiſe as well as unſeaſonable, for <hi>Britiſh Protestants</hi> to conſent to the Abrogation of the <hi>Teſts,</hi> and the Repealing of the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> againſt Papiſts. Moreover, though 'tis poſſible that we might defend our ſelves againſt the dangers that might enſue up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, had we a Prince of our own Religion on the Throne, yet it would be to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render our ſelves unto their power, and to expoſe our ſelves to their Diſcretion, ſhould we venture to do it while a Papiſt of His Majeſties humour hath the weild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scepter. One of the main Arguments, by which Mr. <hi>Pen</hi> would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us againſt all apprehenſion of danger from the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> in caſe the <hi>Teſt</hi> and <hi>Penal Laws</hi> were aboliſhed, is the inconſiderableneſs of their number in compariſon of <hi>Proteſtants, (Good Advice,</hi> p. 49.) And yet if there be ſo many ill Men in the Nation, as he intimates (<hi>Letter 3d. p.</hi> 12.) who being of no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, are ready, upon the motives of worldly Intereſt, to take upon them the profeſſion of any, were it not for fear of being at one time or another called to an account: I do not ſee but that as the Papiſts through having the King on their ſide, are already poſſeſſed of what he ſtiles the <hi>Artificial</hi> Strength of the Kingdom, why they may not, in a ſhort while, were thoſe Laws once deſtroyed, by which the Atheiſtical and profane ſort of Men are kept in awe, come to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain too much of the <hi>natural</hi> ſtrength of it, and raiſe their number to a nearer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality to that of Proteſtants. And though they ſhould never multiply to any near proportion, yet we may eaſily imagine, what a few hands may be able to do, when Authorized by a Popiſh Soveraign, and ſeconded by a well-diſciplin'd Army commanded by Roman Catholicks, could they once get to have a ſhare in the Legiſlation, and to be legally ſtated in all places of Truſt and Power. What need we had of a legal ſecurity for our Religion, in caſe of a Papiſts coming to inherit the Crown, not onely the late King, who thorowly knew his Brothers tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and bigottry, but thoſe Loyal Zealots, who, with an unhappy vigour, oppoſed the Bill of Excluſion, were ſenſible of; and therefore beſides all the ſecurity which we have for our Religion by the Statutes in force, they offered many other proviſions for its protection, and ſeveral of them very threatning to the Monarchy, which we might have had eſtabliſhed into Laws, if through our purſuit of the point of Excluſion, we had not been ſo improvident as to deſpiſe and reject them. He that dares attempt ſo much as he hath done, in oppoſition unto, and defiance of all our Laws; what will he not have the confidence to undertake, and be in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to accompliſh, if theſe obſtructions were out of his way. The <hi>Penal Laws</hi> cannot prejudice the Papiſts in this King's Reign, ſeeing he can connive at the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>execution of them; and the Repeal of them now, cannot benefit the Papiſts when he is gone, becauſe if they do not behave themſelves modeſtly, we can either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh them, or enact others which they will be as little fond of. But their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogation at this time, would infallibly prejudice us, and would prove to be the pulling up of the Sluces, and the throwing down the Dikes, which ſtem the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge that is breaking in upon us, and which hinder the threatning waves from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowing us. And whereas Mr. <hi>Pen</hi> would obtrude upon weak and credulous Men, <hi>That if theſe Laws were Repealed, the King is willing to give us other for our ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and that he would onely exchange the ſecurity, and not deſtroy it, (Letter 2d, p.</hi> 11.) he muſt pardon us, if we do not eaſily believe him, after what we know of his Majeſties natural Genius, and Religious Bigottry, and after what we have ſeen and experienced in the whole courſe of his Government. And if there be no other way of <hi>giving the King an opportunity of Keeping his word with the Church of England,</hi> in preſerving her, and maintaining our Religion, but the Repealing of the <hi>Penal</hi> and <hi>Teſts Laws,</hi> as he intimates unto us (<hi>Good Adv.</hi> p. 50.) we have not found the Royal
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:48501:191"/>Faith ſo ſacred and inviolable in other inſtances, as to rob our ſelves of a Legal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and protection, for to depend upon the precarious one of a bare promiſe, which his <hi>Ghoſtly</hi> Fathers, whenſoever they find it convenient, will tell him it was unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to make, and which he can have a Diſpenſation for the breaking of, at what time he pleaſeth. Nor do we remember, that when he pledged his Faith unto us, in ſo many Promiſes, that the parting with our Laws was declared to be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, upon which he made, and undertook to perform them. Neither can any have the confidence to alledge it, without having recourſe to the Papal Doctrine of <hi>Mental Reſervation.</hi> Which being one of the Principles of that <hi>Order,</hi> under whoſe conduct he is, makes us juſtly afraid to rely upon his word without further Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. However, we do hereby ſee, with what little ſincerity Mr. <hi>Pen</hi> Writes: and what ſmall regard he hath to His Majeſty's honour, when he tells the Church of <hi>England, That if She pleaſe</hi> and like the terms of giving up the <hi>Penal</hi> and <hi>Teſt</hi> Laws againſt Papiſts, that then the <hi>King will perform his word with her</hi> (Good Adv. <hi>p.</hi> 17.) but that otherways, it is <hi>She who breaks with him, and not he with her,</hi> (ib <hi>p.</hi> 44.)</p>
            <p>Though ſomething may be ſaid, for the Repealing of all <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> in reference to every perſwaſion that is called Religion, how incongruouſly ſoever it may claim that Name; yet 'tis inconſiſtent with the ſafety of all Civil Government, and a plain betraying of the Civil Liberties, as well as the eſtabliſhed Religion in Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> not to allow the precluding thoſe from places of Truſt, of whoſe fidelity we can have no aſſurance. And therefore as all that Mr. <hi>Pen</hi> hath alledged for aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Teſts</hi> is miſerably ſilly; ſo he hath thereby too manifeſtly detected the ſmall regard he bears to the ſafety of the Kingdoms and the Proteſtant cauſe, not to be ſuſpected in every thing elſe which he hath more plauſibly and reaſonably aſſerted. For as all Governments have an unqueſtionable Right to uſe means whereby to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve themſelves; ſo 'tis not onely lawful, but expedient, that they ſhould have <hi>Teſts,</hi> by which it may be known, who are fit to be truſted with the Legiſlative and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power. Without this no Conſtitution can ſubſiſt, nor Subjects be in any ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity under it. Neither can any Reaſons be advanced againſt the <hi>Teſt</hi> Laws, but what are of equal force againſt exacting Oaths of Allegiance, and Promiſes of Fidelity from thoſe, whom the Government thinks meet to Employ. One might think, that Mr. <hi>Pen</hi> ſhould allow as much to the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as he challengeth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his Government of <hi>Penſilvania.</hi> For I find, that not onely ſuch ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from a ſhare in the Government there, <hi>who ſhall either be convicted of ill Fame and unſober Coverſation, or who ſhall not acknowledge</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>to be the Son of God, and Saviour of the World, (Chap. 2d. of their Constitutions and Laws)</hi> but that <hi>none ſhall be either choſen into Office, or ſo much as admitted to chooſe, but who ſolemnly declare and promiſe Fidelity to</hi> William Pen <hi>and his Heirs:</hi> (<hi>Chap.</hi> 57.) This I take not onely to be equivalent unto, but ſomething more than our <hi>Tests</hi> do amount unto. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there may be ſeveral whom the <hi>Quakers</hi> may judge perſons <hi>of unſober Converſation;</hi> who may be true to the Civil Intereſt of their Country, and willing, to the utmoſt of their power, to preſerve the Peace, and promote the Proſperity of it; we have no ground to believe the like of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> in relation to the welfare and ſafety of a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> State. And that not onely becauſe they acknowledge a Forraign Juriſdiction inconſiſtent with, and paramount to ours; but becauſe they are obliged by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of their Religion, whenſoever they find themſelves able, to deſtroy and extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate us. I'm ſure that the Motives which in 73, and 78 enforced to the Enacting of the <hi>Teſt</hi> Laws, do at this ſeaſon plead more effectually for the continuing them. Nor had we ſo much cauſe then of being afraid of Popery, or to be apprehenſive of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our Religion overturned by Papiſts, which were the Inducements to the making of thoſe Laws, as we have ground to dread it at this time, and to be jealous of it under the preſent conjuncture. And the more that the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> and their <hi>Advocates</hi> preſs to have theſe Laws aboliſhed, the more fear they excite in us of their deſign if they knew how to effect it, and make us the more reſolved to hazard all we have to maintain them. For as no Papiſt is prejudiced by them in his perſon or property; ſo they are the moſt innocent and moderate ſecurity we can have for the preſervation of our ſelves and of our Religion. Nor could any thing juſtifie the Wiſdom of the Nation in being without them ſo long, but that we were not till then ſuſpicious of the Religion of the Regnant Prince, nor apprehenſive before of the misfortune of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Popiſh Succeſſor. And whereas Mr. <hi>Pen</hi> tells us, that <hi>it were ridiculous to talk of giving liberty of Conſcience, and at the ſame time imagine that the Teſts ought to be continued:</hi> (Good Adv. <hi>p.</hi> 59.) We may not onely reply, that Liberty of Conſcience has no Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Mens being admitted unto Civil Truſts, but that the ſame is practiſed in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral States and Governments both Popiſh and Proteſtant, and in <hi>Penſilvania</hi> it ſelf, where
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:48501:192"/>I ſuppoſe Liberty of Conſcience is allowed. For as we find freedom vouchſafed to Men in matters of Religion, both in <hi>Holland,</hi> and in diverſe Proteſtant States in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> without their being capable of Claiming a ſhare in the Magiſtracy; ſo though the Proteſtant Religion be tolerated in <hi>Collen,</hi> yet it is with a precluſion of all of that Religion from Authority. Whatſoever elſe Mr. <hi>Pen</hi> ſays upon this head, is ſo deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly weak, that as I neither judge it worthy to be taken notice of, nor have Room to do it; ſo I am confident, that be his Religion what it will, which by reaſon of his late Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers I have more Reaſon to ſuſpect than ever, he writes as much againſt his conſcience and Judgment, as againſt the Pattern and Example which he hath ſet us in <hi>Penſilvania.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſs, the Diſſenters are under more temptations, than other Proteſtants, to wiſh for, and to endeavour the Abrogation of the <hi>Penal</hi> Laws. And as this makes them to be the more particularly applied unto by the Court for the promoting of it; ſo it renders them the more liable to be influenced by Diſcourſes of the nature and complexion that Mr. <hi>Pen</hi>'s are of. But I hope they will conſider, that the preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion to themſelves, their poſterity, and the Kingdom; is more valuable than a little temporal eaſe, and which they onely hold by the precarious te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of the King's word. Surely they cannot be ſo infatuated, as to think that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts love them, or that they will truſt them any longer, than they have occaſion to uſe them. I would think, that it ſhould both make them bluſh to find themſelves coupled with <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> in Courts and Employments, while their fellow Proteſtants are ſhut out, and make them jealous, that they are onely made uſe of for ſome miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and ſiniſtrous end. They can never hope to lay ſuch a merit upon the Court, as the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath done; and her reward may forewarn them what they are to expect, when they have done the job that is allotted for them. His Majeſties ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in giving liberty to <hi>Diſſenting Proteſtants,</hi> may be eaſily gueſſed at, by his order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 26 <hi>poor Scots Diſſenters</hi> to be ſent to the <hi>Barbadoes</hi> for ſlaves; and this both ſince the Emitting of his <hi>Firſt Proclamation for a Toleration,</hi> and without the having any thing objected to them, but what concerned their Conſciences in matters of Religion. The Terms upon which Phanaticks are to enjoy his Majeſties favour, and how long they are to expect the continuance of that mighty Grace, we have declared by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as they ſtand recorded in my Lord <hi>Melfort</hi>'s <hi>Letter to the Presbyterian Miniſters in Scotland.</hi> Namely, <hi>That he intends to continue their Liberty, if he have ſuitable encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and concurrence from them in their Doctrine and Practice, and if they concur with him in removing of the Penal Laws.</hi> This is the Task that they are indulged and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred for, and 'tis a wonder that they do not foreſee that their deſtiny will be one and the ſame, in caſe they have once done it, as if they do it not. This is the Fountain of all his Majeſties friendſhip to them; and the glorious aſſertion of its having been always <hi>his Principle, that Conſcience ought not to be conſtrained, and that none ought to be perſecuted for meer matters of Religion,</hi> is at laſt dwindled into this, that he will give them Liberty ſo long as they will concurr and cooperate with him in his introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of Popery, and till they have deſtroyed the Laws by which our own Religion is fenced about and defended. Certainly it is high time to conſider, what this is which is exacted of them, and what hazard they not onely expoſe the Nation and the Goſpel unto, but what guilt they derive upon themſelves if they undertake and purſue it. <hi>Nor can they promote the Repealing of the</hi> Penal <hi>Laws againſt Papiſts, and the</hi> Teſt <hi>Statutes; without running themſelves under the guilt of Perjury, and the making themſelves chargeable before God, with all the blood that was ſhed in the War between King</hi> Charles I. <hi>and the Parliament.</hi> For as one of the Articles of the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant</hi> was, to endeavour to extirpate Popery; ſo <hi>the countenance and incouragement which that Prince gave to Papiſts, was a main ingredient in the State of the Quarrel for which they drew their Swords againſt him, and in the aſſertion whereof ſo many thouſands loſt their lives.</hi> Can they now be willing to act in direct oppoſition to that <hi>Covenant,</hi> which rather than renounce and diſclaim the obligatory force of, many of them have ſuffered ſo much? or would they have the guilt of all the blood lye upon them, which was ſhed in the former long and fatal War? I'm perſwaded that many, who are moſt forward, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the Abrogation of the <hi>Teſts</hi> and <hi>Penal</hi> Laws againſt Papiſts, never gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves leave to think what they are hurried unto. Mr. <hi>Pen</hi> tells them, he will beg them for Fools if they do it not, (<hi>Good Advice, p.</hi> 54.) and I dare take upon me to ſay, that they are moſt Execrable Knaves and Villains, if they do it. Is it poſſible they ſhould be ſo deprived of all underſtanding, as not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves meerly trick't upon, and made uſe of for Tools to promote a Deſign which others have the wiſdom and integrity not to be inſtrumental in; when <hi>Jeffreys,</hi> who a while ago, ſaid on the <hi>Bench, Shew me a Fanatick, and I will ſhew you a Knave, and that 'twas impoſſible to be a Fanatick, and not to be a Rebel;</hi> ſhould now
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:48501:192"/>careſs them as his Majeſties beſt and moſt Loyal Subjects, and tell them, upon their being advanced to Offices, That <hi>he is glad to find honeſt men come to be employed,</hi> which was the Complement he lately beſtowed upon Sir <hi>John Shorter.</hi> 'Tis likely they may be told, that if they will fall in with the Papiſts for deſtroying the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that they ſhall be ſecured from the Reſentments of the next <hi>Heir,</hi> by having the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy made diſſolvable into a <hi>Republick</hi> upon his Majeſties death. And this would ſeem to be what Mr. <hi>Pen</hi> intends, when he tells us, that ſuch a <hi>Bargain will be driven with the Kingdom, as will make the Church of</hi> England <hi>think, that half a Loaf had been better, than no Bread;</hi> (Good Adv. <hi>p.</hi> 43.) <hi>and that one year</hi> will ſhew <hi>the Trick, and mightily deceive her, and the opportunity of her being preſerved loſt, and another Bargain dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven mightily to her diſadvantage,</hi> (Ibid. p. 42.) But as it will be impoſſible for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts and Diſſenters, ſhould they conſpire together, to be able to effect it, conſidering the intereſt which her integrity in the Proteſtant Religion, and her tenderneſs for the Rights and Liberties of the Kingdoms, have juſtly acquired unto her; ſo it were both the moſt fooliſh, as well as criminal thing, which any, pretending themſelves Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, can be guilty of, to be in any meaſure acceſſory unto it. For as there is nothing in reference to their own Religious Liberties, and the Priviledges of the Nation, which they may not undoubtedly expect, from her Juſtice as well as from her Mercy and Moderation; ſo there is no means left within our view, either to give a laſting Peace and a firm ſettlement to Three diſtracted Kingdoms, or to bring the Proteſtant Intereſt into ſuch a condition, as may ballance the Papal grandure in <hi>Europe,</hi> and give check to the rage of Perſecution in all places, but her happy advancement to the Thrones of Great <hi>Brittain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> when it ſhall pleaſe God to remove his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. Until which time, I hope all who call themſelves Proteſtants, will ſubmit to the worſt of fate, rather than to fall under the Curſe of this Age, and Ignominy, with all that ſhall come after, for becoming an United Party with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in any of her Deſigns, how plauſible ſoever they may appear.</p>

            <head>The Ill Effects of Animoſities.</head>
            <p>'TIS long ſince the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> under the Authority of the <hi>late King</hi> and his <hi>Brother,</hi> was embark'd in a deſign of ſubverting the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and of introducing and eſtabliſhing <hi>Popery.</hi> For the two <hi>Royal Brothers</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the time of their Exile ſeduced by the Careſſes and Importunities of their Mother, allured by the Promiſes and Favours of Popiſh Princes, and being wheedled by the Crafts and Arts of Prieſts and Jeſuites, who are cunning to deceive, and know how to prevail upon perſons that were but weakly eſtabliſhed in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and wholly ſtrangers to the practice and power of the Religion they were tempted from; they not only abjured the Reformed Religion, and became reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but by their Example, and the Influence which they had over thoſe that depended upon them, both for preſent Subſiſtence, and future Hopes, they drew many that accompanied them in their Baniſhment, to renounce the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Worſhip, and Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> though in the War between <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt and the Parliament, they had pretended to fight for them in equal conjunction with the Prerogatives of the Crown. So that upon the Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the year 1660, they were not only moulded and prepared themſelves for promoting the deſires of the Pope and his Emiſſaries, but they were furniſhed with a ſtock of Gentlemen, out of whom they might have a ſupply of Inſtruments, both in Parliament and elſewhere, to co-operate with and under them in the methods that ſhould be judged moſt proper and ſubſervient to the Extirpation of Proteſtancy, and the bringing the Nation again into a Servitude to the Triple Crown. And beſides the Obligations that the Principles of the Religion to which they had revolted, laid them under for eradicating the eſtabliſhed Doctrine and Worſhip, they had bound themſelves unto it, by all the Promiſes and Oaths which perſons are capable of having preſcribed unto, and exacted of them.</p>
            <p>Nor can any now disbelieve his late Majeſty's having lived and died a Papiſt, who hath either heard what he both ſaid and did, when under the proſpect of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Death, and paſt hope of acting a part any longer on the preſent Stage, or who have ſeen and read the two Papers left in his Cloſet, which have been ſince publiſhed to the World, and atteſted for Authentick by the preſent King. And had we been ſo juſt to our ſelves, as to have examined the whole courſe of his Reign, both in his Alliances Abroad, and his moſt Important Counſels and Actions at Home; or had we hearkened to the Reports of thoſe who knew him at <hi>Collen</hi> and in <hi>Flanders,</hi> we had been long ago convinced of what Religion he was. Nor were his many repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:48501:193"/>Proteſtations of his Zeal for Proteſtancy, but in order to delude the Nation, till inſenſibly as to us, and with ſafety to himſelf, he had overturned the Religion which he pretended to own, and had introduced that which he inveighed againſt. And while with the higheſt aſſeverations he diſclaimed the being what he really was, and with moſt ſacred and tremendous Oaths, profeſſed the being what he was not, his Religion might in the mean time have been traced through all the ſignal Occurrences of his Government, and have been diſcerned, written in Capital Letters, through all the material Affairs wherein he was engaged, from the Day he aſcended the Throne, till the Hour he left the World. His entring into two Wars againſt the <hi>Dutch,</hi> without any provocation on their part, or ground on his, ſave their being a Proteſtant State; his being not only conſcious unto, but interpoſing his Commands, as well as Encouragements for the burning of <hi>London.</hi> His concurrence in all the parts of the Popiſh Plot, except that which the Jeſuites, with a few others, were involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in againſt himſelf, his ſtifling that Conſpiracy, and delivering the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks from the Dangers into which it had caſt them. His being the Author of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny forged Plots, which he cauſed to be charged on Proteſtants. His conſtant Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies with <hi>France,</hi> to the diſobliging his people; the betraying of <hi>Europe;</hi> the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the reformed in that Kingdom, and the encouraging the Deſign carried on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them for their Extirpation. His entailing the Duke of <hi>York</hi> upon the Nation, contrary to the Deſires and Endeavours of three ſeveral Parliaments, and that not out of Love to his perſon, but Affection to Popery, which he knew that Gentleman would introduce and eſtabliſh: All theſe, beſides many other things which might be named, were ſufficient Evidences of the late King's Religion, and of the Deſign he was engaged in for the Subverſion of Ours. So that it would fill a ſober perſon with amazement, to think, that after all this, there ſhould be ſo many ſincere Proteſtants and true Engliſh Men, who not only believed the late King to be of the reformed Religion, but with an inſatiableneſs thirſted after the Blood of thoſe that durſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe repreſent him. And had it not been for his receiving Abſolution and Extream Unction from a Popiſh Prieſt at his Death; and for what he left in writing in the two Papers found in his <hi>ſtrong Box,</hi> he would have ſtill paſſed for a Prince who had lived and died a cordial and zealous Proteſtant, and whoſoever had muttered any thing to the contrary, would have been branded for a Villain and an execrable perſon. But with what a ſcent and odor muſt it recommend his Memory to them, to conſider his having not onely lived and died in the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to all his publick Speeches, ſolemn Declarations, and higheſt Aſſeverations to his People in Parliament; but his participating, from time to time, of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as Adminiſtred in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> while, in the interim, he had Abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red our Religion, ſtood reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and had obliged himſelf by moſt ſacred Vows, and was endeavouring, by all the Frauds and Arts imaginable, to ſubvert the eſtabliſhed Doctrin and Worſhip, and ſet up Hereſy and Idolatry in their room. And it muſt needs give them an abhorrent Idea and Character of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and a loathſom repreſentation of thoſe truſted with the Conduct and Guidance of the Conſciences of Men in the Roman Communion, that they ſhould not onely diſpenſe with, and indulge ſuch Crimes and Villanies, but proclaim them Sanctified and Meritorious from the end which they are calculated for, and levelled at.</p>
            <p>And for his dear Brother, and renowned Succeſſor, who poſſeſſed the Throne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, I ſuppoſe his moſt partial Admirers, who took him for a Prince, not onely merciful in his Temper, and imbued with all gracious Inclinations to our Laws, and the Rights of the Subject, but for one Orthodox in his Religion, and who would prove a zealous Defender of the Doctrine, Worſhip and Diſcipline of the Church eſtabliſhed by Law, are before this time both undeceived, and filled with Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for his having abuſed their Credulity, deceived their Expectations, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached all their Gloryings and Boaſtings of him. For as it would have been the greateſt Affront they could have put upon the King, to queſtion his being of the Roman Communion, or to detract from his Zeal for the introduction of Popery, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his own antecedent Proteſtations, as well as the many Statutes in force for the preſervation of the Reformed Religion; ſo I muſt take the liberty to tell them, that his Apoſtacy is not of ſo late Date as the World is made commonly to believe. For though it was many Years concealed, and the contrary pretended and diſſembled; yet it is moſt certain, that he Abjured the Proteſtant Religion, ſoon after the Exilement of the Royal Family, and was reconciled to the Romiſh Church at St. <hi>Germains</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> Nor were ſeveral of the then ſuffering Biſhops and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy ignorant of this, though they had neither the Integrity nor Courage to give the Nation and Church warning of it. And within theſe five Years there was in the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody of a very worthy and honeſt Gentleman, a Letter written to the late Biſhop of <hi>D.</hi>
               <pb n="373" facs="tcp:48501:193"/>by a Doctor of Divinity then attending upon the Royal Brothers, wherein the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy of the then Duke of <hi>York</hi> to the See of <hi>Rome</hi> is particularly related, and an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count given, how much the Dutcheſs of <hi>Tremoville</hi> (though without being her ſelf, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) had heard the Queen Mother glorying of it, bewailed it as a diſhonour unto the Royal Family, and as that which might prove of pernicious conſequence to the Proteſtant Intereſt. But though the old Queen privately rejoyced and triumphed in it, yet ſhe knew too well what diſadvantage it might be, both to her Son, and to the Papal Cauſe in <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> to have it at that Seaſon communicated and divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Thereupon it remained a Secret for many Years, and by virtue of a Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he ſometimes joined in all Ordinances with thoſe of the Proteſtant Communion. But for all the Art, Hypocriſy and Sacrilege, by which it was endeavoured to be concealed, it might have been eaſily diſcerned, as manifeſting it ſelf in the whole Courſe of his Actions. And at laſt his own Zeal, the Importunity of the Prieſts, and the Cunning of the late King, prevailing over Reaſons of State, he withdrew from all Acts of Fellowſhip with the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But neither that, nor his refuſing the <hi>Teſt</hi> enjoyned by <hi>Law,</hi> for diſtinguiſhing Papiſts from Proteſtants, though there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was forced, both to reſign his Office of Lord High Admiral, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining the Oath which the Laws of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the ſecuring a Proteſtant Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, enjoyn to be taken by the High Commiſſioner; nor yet ſo many Parliaments having endeavoured to get him Excluded from Succeſſion to the Crown, upon the account of having revolted to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thereby become dangerous to the Eſtabliſhed Religion, could make impreſſion upon a wilfully deluded and obſtinate ſort of Proteſtants, but in defiance of all means of Conviction, they would perſwade themſelves, that he was ſtill a Zealot for our Religion, and a grand Patriot of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Nor could any thing undeceive them, till upon his Brother's Death he had openly declared himſelf a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> and afterwards in the fumes and raptures of his Victory over the late Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> had diſcovered and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed his Intentions of overthrowing both our Religion and Laws. Yea ſo cloſely had ſome ſealed up their Eyes againſt all beams of Light, and hardned themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Evidences from Reaſon and Fact, that had it pleaſed the Almighty God to have proſpered the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Arms in the Summer 85. the preſent King would have gone off the Stage with the Reputation among them, of a Prince tender of the Laws of the Kingdom; and who, notwithſtanding his own being a Papiſt, would have preſerved the Reformed Religion, and have maintained the Church of <hi>England</hi> in all her Grandure and Rights. And though his whole Life had been but one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Conſpiracy againſt our Civil Liberties and Priviledges, he had left the Throne with the Character, and under the Eſteem of a Gentleman; that in the whole courſe of his Government would have regulated himſelf by the Rules of the Conſtitution, and the Statutes of the Realm.</p>
            <p>Now among all the Methods fallen upon by the Royal Brothers, for the undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſubverting our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> there is none that they have purſued with more Ardor, and wherein they have been more ſucceſsful to the compaſſing of their Deſigns, than in their dividing <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and alienating their Affections, and embit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering their Minds from and againſt one another. And had not this lain under their proſpect, and the means of effecting it appeared eaſie, they might have been <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves, while in the mean time they had been diſpenſed with to proteſt and ſwear their being of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> and they might have envied our Liberties, and bewailed their Reſtriction from Arbitrary and Deſpotical Power; but they never durſt have entertained a Thought of ſubverting the <hi>Eſtabliſhed Religion,</hi> or of altering the Civil Government, nor would they ever have had the boldneſs to have attempted the introducing and erecting <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Tyranny</hi> in their room. And whoſoever ſhould have put them upon reducing the Nation to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or upon rendring the Monarchy unlimited and independent on the Law, would have been thought to have laid a Snare for expoſing the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to greater Severities than they were obnoxious unto before, and to have projected the robbing the Crown of the Prerogatives which belong unto it by the Rules of the Conſtitution, and to which it was ſo lately reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And the deſpair of ſucceeding, would have rendred the Royal Brothers deaf to all Importunities from <hi>Romiſh Emiſſaries,</hi> and Court Minions. Neither the Promiſes and Oaths which they had made and taken beyond Sea to introduce Popery, nor their Ambition to advance themſelves beyond the reſtraint of Laws, and the Controul of Parliaments, would have prevailed upon them to have encountred the Hazards and Difficulties, which in caſe of the Union of <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants,</hi> muſt have attended and enſued upon Attempts and Endeavours of the one kind and of the other. Or ſhould their beloved <hi>Popery,</hi> and their own Bigottedneſs in the <hi>Romiſh Superſtition,</hi> have ſo far
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:48501:194"/>tranſported them beyond the bounds of Wiſdom and Diſcretion, as to have appeared poſſeſſed with an Intention of ſubverting the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and of enſlaving the Nation to the Superſtition and Idolatry of <hi>Rome,</hi> they would have been made ſoon to underſtand, That the Laws which make it Treaſon to own the Juriſdiction of the Pope, or to ſeduce the meaneſt Subject to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were not enacted in vain, and that thoſe, as well as many more, made for the Security of the <hi>Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> and to prevent the growth and introduction of <hi>Popery,</hi> were not to be dallied and plaid withal. Or, ſhould they have been ſo far infatuated and abandoned of all Underſtanding, as out of a fooliſh and haughty Affectation of being Abſolute, to have attempted the Alteration of the Civil Government, they would have been immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately and unanimouſly told, That the People have the ſame Right to their Liberties, that the King hath to the Prerogatives of the Crown. And if they would not have been contented with what belongs unto the Prince, by the Common and Statute-Laws of the Realm, but had invaded the Priviledges reſerved unto the Subject: they would have been made to know, that they might not onely be withſtood, in what they ſtrove to Uſurp, contrary to <hi>Magna Charta, the Petition of Right,</hi> and other Laws of the Kingdom, but that thereby they forfeited, and might be diſſeized of what either appertained unto the Crown by fundamental Agreements, or hath been ſince ſettled upon the Monarch by Statute-Laws. Nor could any thing have emboldened his late Majeſty and the preſent King to Enterprizes of the one kind or the other, but the proſpect of begetting a Miſunderſtanding, Jealouſie, and Rancor among <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and thereby both of making them inſtrumental to the ruin of one another, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributary to the loſs of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberty and the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> which they equally value and eſteem, and to the ſetting up <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Tyranny,</hi> which the one deteſteth and abhorreth no leſs than the other.</p>
            <p>Though all <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants</hi> have ever been at an Accord in all the Eſſentials and Vitals of Religion, yet from the very beginning of the Reformation, there have been Differences among them concerning Eccleſiaſtical Government and Diſcipline, and about Forms, Rites, and Ceremonies of Worſhip. And had they conſulted either their Duty to God, or the common Intereſt of <hi>Religion,</hi> they might have found ways either for removing the occaſions of them, or they ought to have lived together as Brethren, notwithſtanding the differences which were among them in thoſe things. But how much wiſer are the Children of this World, than thoſe of the Kingdom of God and of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> For though the differences among the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do far exceed ours, both in their number, and in the Importance of thoſe things wherein they diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, yet they do mutually tolerate and bear with one another. The matters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they differ are neither made the Terms of their Church-Communion, nor the Grounds of mutual Excommunications and Perſecutions.</p>
            <p>But alas, one Party among us hath been always endeavouring to cut or ſtretch others to their own Size, and have made thoſe things which themſelves ſtile Indifferent, both the Qualifications for admiſſion to the <hi>Paſtoral Office,</hi> and the Conditions of Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the Ordinances of the Goſpel. Nor is it to be expreſſed, what Advantages were hereby adminiſtred all along to the Common Enemy; and what Sufferings peaceable and orthodox Chriſtians were expoſed unto from their peeviſh and angry Brethren. And though theſe Things, with the Heats begotten among all, and the Calamities undergone by one ſide, were not the cauſe of that funeſtous War betwixt <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt and the <hi>Parliament,</hi> yet they were an occaſion of diverting Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands from the ſide which the Perſecuting Church-men eſpouſed, and engaging them in the behalf of the <hi>two Houſes,</hi> in the Quarrel which they begun and carried on againſt that <hi>Prince,</hi> for defence of the Civil Liberties, Priviledges and Rights of the People but ſome of the Mitred Clergy were ſo far from being made wiſe by their own and the Nations Sufferings, as upon their <hi>Reſtoration</hi> to hearken to moderate Counſels, and to decline their former Rigours and Severities, that they became the Tools and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of the Court, not onely for reviving, but for heightning and enflaming all the Differences which had formerly been among <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants.</hi> For the <hi>Royal Brothers</hi> finding nothing more adapted and ſubſervient than this, to their Deſign of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the Government, and ſubverting <hi>Religion,</hi> they animated thoſe waſpiſh and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politick Eccleſiaſticks, not onely to purſue the <hi>Reſtoration</hi> of all thoſe things which had given riſe and occaſion to former <hi>Diſſentions</hi> and <hi>Perſecutions,</hi> but to lay new Snares for alienating many perſons of unſpotted lives and tender <hi>Conſciences,</hi> from the Church, and of rendring them obnoxious to ſuffer in their Names, Perſons and Eſtates. And what a ſatisfaction was it to the late King and his Brother, to find the old Epiſcopal Clergy prepared through Principles of revenge, as well as from Love of Domination, Ambition and Covetouſneſs, to fall in with the Deſign, not onely of Increaſing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:48501:194"/>among Proteſtants, both by making the Conditions of entring upon the Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Function narrower, and for ſcrewing Conformity with the Church in her Forms and Ceremonies of Worſhip, into Teſts, for admiſſion to Magiſtracy and Civil Truſts, but of obtaining ſeveral Laws againſt Diſſenters, whereby the Penalties to which they foreſaw that People would become liable, were rendred greater than they had been before, and their Sufferings made more mercileſs, inhumane and intolerable.</p>
            <p>For though his late Majeſty had, by a Declaration dated at <hi>Breda,</hi> promiſed Indulgence to all Proteſtants that would live peaceably under the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet it was never in his Thoughts to perform it; and the previous Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which he was under to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> had a virtue to ſuperſede and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel his Engagements to <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hereticks. And all he intended by that Declaration was onely to wheedle and lull thoſe into a tameneſs of admitting his Return into his Dominions, whom a jealouſie of being afterwards perſecuted for their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, might have awakened to withſtand and diſpute it. And, to give him his due, he never judged himſelf longer bound to the obſervation of Promiſes and Oaths made to his People, than, until without hazard to his Perſon and Government, he could violate and break them. Accordingly he was no ſooner ſeated in the Throne of his Anceſtors, and thoſe whom he had been apprehenſive of Reſiſtance and Diſturbance from, put out of Capacity and Condition of attempting any thing againſt him; but he thought himſelf diſcharged from every thing that the Royal Word and Faith of a Prince had been pledged and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to ſtake for in that Declaration, and from that day forward acted in direct oppoſition to all the Parts and Branches of it. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſoon after his Return obtained a Parliament moulded and adapted, both to his Arbitrary and <hi>Popiſh</hi> Ends he immediately ſet all his Inſtruments at work for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of ſuch Laws to be Enacted, as might divide and weaken Proteſtants, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by make us, not onely the more eaſie Prey to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but afford them an advantage through our Scuffles, of undermining our Religion with the leſs notice and obſervation.</p>
            <p>How ſuch perſons came to be choſen, and to conſtitute the Majority of the Houſe of Commons, who by their Actings have made themſelves Infamous and Execrable to all Ages, were a matter too large to penetrate at preſent into the Reaſons of; but that which my Theme conducts me to obſerve, is, That as they ſacrificed the Treaſure of the Nation to the profuſeneſs and prodigality of the <hi>Prince,</hi> and our Rights and Liberties to his Ambition and Arbitrary Will, ſo they both introduced and eſtabliſhed thoſe Things which have been a means of dividing us; and by many ſevere and repeated Laws, they ſubjected a great number of induſtrious Engliſh-men and true Proteſtants, to Excommunications, Impriſonments, rigorous and multiplied Fines, and all this for Matters onely relating to their Conſciences, and for their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God in the Ordinances of his Worſhip and Houſe. And notwithſtanding the late King's often pretended compaſſion to the Diſſenters, it will be hard to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them, unleſs in Effects which proceed from very different and oppoſite Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. The diſtance which he kept them from his Perſon and Favour; the influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing theſe Members of both Houſes that depended upon him, to be the Authors and Promoters of Severities againſt them; the enjoyning ſo often the Judges and Juſtices of Peace to execute the Laws upon them in their utmoſt rigour; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigating the Biſhops and Eccleſiaſtical Courts, if at any time they relented in their Proſecutions, to purſue them with freſh Citations and Cenſures; the arraigning them, not onely upon the Statutes made intentionally againſt Diſſenters, but upon thoſe that were originally and ſolely enacted againſt the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> theſe, and other Procedures of that Nature, are the onely Proofs and Evidences which I can find, of the late King's Bowels, Pity and Tenderneſs to them. And whereas the weak Church-men were impoſed upon to believe, that all the Severity againſt the Nonconformiſts, was the Fruit of his Zeal for the Proteſtant Religion, and for the ſecurity of the Worſhip and Diſcipline eſtabliſhed by Law; they might have eaſily diſcovered, if Paſſion, Prejudice, Wealth and Honour had not blinded them, that all this was calculated for Ends per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly deſtructive to the Church, and inconſiſtent with the Safety and Happineſs of all Proteſtants. For as his ſeeking oftner than once to have wriggled himſelf into a Power of ſuperſeding and diſpenſing with thoſe Laws and ſuſpending their Execution, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhews, that he never intended the ſupport and preſervation of the Church by them; ſo his non-execution of the <hi>Laws</hi> againſt Papiſts; his conniving at their encreaſe; his perſwading thoſe neareſt unto him to reconcile themſelves to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> as he did, among others, the late D. of <hi>Monmouth;</hi> his countenancing the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> in their open and intollerable Inſolencies; and his advancing them to the moſt gainful and <hi>Important Places</hi> and <hi>truſts,</hi> ſufficiently declare, that he never had any love to <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> or care of the <hi>Reformed Religion;</hi> but that all his deſigns were of a contrary tendency,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:48501:195"/>and his faireſt Pretences for the Protection and Grandure of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> adapted to other ends.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Royal Brothers</hi> having obtained ſuch <hi>Laws</hi> to be enacted, whereby one <hi>Party</hi> of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> was armed with means of oppreſſing and perſecuting all others, neither the neceſſity of their Affairs at any time ſince, nor the Application and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſure of ſeveral Parliaments for removing the Grounds of our Differences and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimoſities, by an Indulgence, to be paſt into a <hi>Law,</hi> could prevail, either upon his late Majeſty, or the preſent King, to forgoe the Advantage they had gotten of keeping us in mutual Enmity, and thereby of miniſtring to their projection of ſupplanting our <hi>Religion,</hi> and re-eſtabliſhing the Faith and Worſhip of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the laſt King, not onely refuſed to conſent to ſuch Bills as diverſe late <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> had prepared for indulging Diſſenters, and for bringing them into an union of Counſels, and Conjunction of Intereſt with thoſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting the Conſpiracies of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> againſt our Legal Government and Eſtabliſhed <hi>Religion;</hi> but he rejected an Addreſs for ſuſpending the Execution of the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> againſt <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> which was offered and preſented unto him by that very <hi>Parliament</hi> which had framed and enacted thoſe cruel and hard <hi>Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the <hi>Royal Brothers</hi> have made it their conſtant Buſineſs to cheriſh a Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Rancour among <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and to provoke one Party to perſecute and ruine another; ſo nothing could more naturally fall in with the Deſign of Arbitrarineſs or be more ſubſervient to the betraying the Nation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Papal Idolatry</hi> and Juriſdiction. For ſeveral <hi>Penal Laws</hi> againſt a conſiderable Body of People, do either expoſe them againſt whom they are enacted, to be deſtroyed by the <hi>Prince,</hi> with whom the executive Power of the <hi>Law</hi> is truſted and depoſited; or they prove a Temptation to ſuch as are obnoxious of reſigning themſelves in ſuch a manner to the Will and Pleaſure of the Monarch, for the obtaining his connivancy at their violation of the <hi>Laws,</hi> as is unſafe and dangerous for the common Liberty and Good of the Kingdom. For in caſe the Supreme Magiſtrate purſue an Intereſt diſtinct from, and deſtructive to that of his People, they who the <hi>Law</hi> hath made liable to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, are brought under Inducements of becoming ſo many <hi>Pariſans</hi> for abetting him in his Deſigns, in hopes of being thereupon protected from the <hi>Penal Statutes,</hi> the execution whereof is committed to him. And as it is not agreeable to the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Prudence which ought to be among Men, nor to the Mercy and Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which ſhould be among Chriſtians, for one party to ſurrender another into the Hands and Power of the Soveraign, to be impoveriſhed and ruined by him at his pleaſure, eſpecially when thoſe whom they give up to be thus treated and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, are at agreement with them in all the Eſſentials of Religion, equally zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as themſelves for the Liberties of their Country; and who, for Sobriety in their Lives, Induſtry in their Callings, and Uſefulneſs in the Common-Wealth, are inferior to none of their Fellow-Subjects: So it is obvious to any, who give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves leave to think, that the King would long ere this have been ſtated in the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteneſs that is aſpired after, and both Church and State reduced to lie at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the Monarch, provided the Nonconformiſts, for procuring his Favour in non-execution of the Laws, had ſuffered themſelves to be prevailed upon, and drawn over to ſtand by and aſſiſt him in his <hi>Popiſh</hi> and Deſpotical Deſigns.</p>
            <p>But that honeſt people, though hated and maligned by their Brethren, rather than be found aiding the King in his Uſurpations over the Kingdom, have choſen to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe the utmoſt Calamities they could be made ſubject unto, either through the Execution of thoſe Laws which had been made againſt them, or through our Princes and their Miniſters wrecking their Malice upon them in Arbitrary and Illegal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods. But what the Royal Brothers could not work the afflicted and perſecuted Side unto, they found the Art to engage the other Side in, though not onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted from all Obnoxiouſneſs to thoſe Laws, but ſtrengthened and ſupported by them. For as ſoon as the Court begun to deſpair of prevailing upon Diſſenters to become their Tools and Inſtruments of enſlaving the Nation, and of exalting the Monarchy to a Deſpotical Abſoluteneſs, they applied to the Bigots of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whom by gratifying with a vigorous Execution of the Laws upon Diſſenters, they brought to abett, applaud and juſtifie them in all thoſe Counſels and Ways which have reduced us into that miſerable condition wherein we not long ſince were. The Clergy being advanced to Grandure and Opulency, things which many of them are fonder of, and lother to foregoe than Religion and the Rights of the Nation, the Court made it their buſineſs to poſſeſs them with a Belief, that unleſs the Fanaticks were ſuppreſſed and ruined, they could not enjoy with Security their Dignities and Wealth. Whereupon not onely the leſſer Levites, but the
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:48501:195"/>Superior Clergy having their Leſſon and Cue given them from <hi>White-hall</hi> and St. <hi>James</hi>'s, fell upon purſuing the Nonconformiſts with Eccleſiaſtical Puniſhments, and upon exciting and animating the Civil Officers againſt them. And under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of preſerving and defending the Church they gave themſelves over to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit ſerving of the Court, and became not onely Advocates but Inſtruments for the robbing of <hi>Corporations</hi> of their Charters, for impoſing Sheriffs upon the City of <hi>London</hi> who had not been legally elected, and of fining and puniſhing Men arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily for no Crime, ſave the having aſſerted their own and the Nations Rights in modeſt and lawful ways. Poſterity will hardly believe that ſo many of the Prelatical Clergy, and ſo great a number of Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould from an Enmity unto, and pretended Jealouſie of the Diſſenters, have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Tools under the late King for juſtifying the Diſſolution of ſo many Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Invaſion made upon their Priviledges, the ridiculing and ſtifling of the Popiſh Plot, the ſhamming of forged Conſpiracies upon Proteſtants, the condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral to Death for High-Treaſon, who could be rendred guilty by the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of no known Law, and finally for advancing a Gentleman to the Throne, who had been engaged in a Conjuration againſt Religion and the Legal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and whom three ſeveral Parliaments would have therefore Excluded from the Right of Succeſſion. And being ſeduced into an eſpouſal of the Intereſts of the Court againſt Religion, Parliaments and the Nation, it is doleful to conſider what Doctrines both from Pulpit and Preſs were thereupon brought forth and divulged. Such as <hi>Monarchy's being a Government by Divine Right; That it is in the Prince's Power to Rule as he pleaſeth; That it is a Grace and Condeſcention in the King to give an Account of what he does; That for Parliaments to direct, or regulate the Succeſſion, borders upon Treaſon, and is an Offence againſt the Law of Nature; And that the onely thing left to Subjects, in caſe the King will Tyrannize over their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, Perſons and Eſtates, is tamely to ſuffer,</hi> and as ſome of them did ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly expreſs it, <hi>to exerciſe Paſſive Obedience.</hi> So that by corrupting the Minds and Conſciences of men with thoſe peſtilent and ſlaviſh Notions, they betrayed the Nation, both to the Miſchiefs which have alrerdy overtaken us, and to what fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we were threatned with. Nor did theſe Doctrines tend meerly to the fetter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and enfeebling the Spirits of Men, but they were a Temptation to the Royal Brothers to put in Execution what they had been ſo long contriving, and travelling with, and were a kind of reprimanding them for being ignorant of their own Right and Power, and for not exerting it with that Vigour and Expedition which they might. I do acknowledge that there were many both of the Sacred Order, and of the Laick Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who were far from being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with thoſe brutiſh Sentiments and Opinions, and who were as zealous as any for having the Monarchy kept within its ancient limits; Parliaments maintained in their wonted Reverence and Authority; the Subjects preſerved in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their immemorial Priviledges; and who were far from ſacrificing our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Laws to Popery and Arbitrarineſs; and from lulling us into a Tameneſs and Lethargy, in caſe the Court ſhould attempt the aboliſhing the eſtabliſhed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Worſhip, and the ſubverting and changing the Civil Government. But alaſs! beſides their being immediately branded with the Name of <hi>Trimmer</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> and regiſtred in the Kalender with thoſe that ſtood precluded the King's Favour, and merited his Animadverſion; their Modeſty was ſoon drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſilenced in the loud Noiſe of their clamorous Brethren, and their retiredneſs from Converſation, while the others frequented all places of Society and publick Concourſe, deprived the Nation of the benefit of their Example, and the happineſs of their Inſtructions. Nor have I mentioned the Extravagancies of any of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticks and Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> with a deſign either of reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and upbraiding them, or of provoking and exaſperating the Diſſenters to Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but onely to ſhew how fatal our Diviſions have been unto us, what exceſſes they have occaſioned our being hurried and tranſported into, and what miſchievous Improvement our Enemies have made of them, to the ſupplanting and almoſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of all that is valuable unto us, as we are Engliſh-men, Chriſtians and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</p>
            <p>And as our Animoſities, through our Diviſions, gave the Courrt an advantage of ſuborning that Party, which they pretended to befriend and uphold, into a Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all their Counſels, and Projections againſt our Religion and Laws; ſo by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the unnatural Heats wherewith Proteſtants have been enflamed and enraged againſt Proteſtants, many weak, ungrounded, and unſtable Souls, have been tempted to queſtion the Truth of our Religion, and to Apoſtatize to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <pb n="378" facs="tcp:48501:196"/>and thereupon have become united in Inclination, Power and Endeavours with the Court, and our old Enemies the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> for the Extirpation of Proteſtancy, and the alteration of the Government. As it hath been matter of Offence and Scandal to all Men, ſo it hath been ground of ſtumbling and falling unto many, to ſee thoſe who are profeſſedly of the ſame Religion, to be mutually embittered againſt one another, and ſo far tranſported with Malice and Rage, as to ſeek and purſue each others Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For ſuch a Carriage and Behaviour are ſo contrary to the Spirit and Principles of Chriſtianity, and to the Genius and Temper of True Religion, that it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel if perſons ignorant of the Holy Scriptures, and ſtrangers to the converting and comforting Vertue of the Doctrine of the Goſpel aſſerted in our Confeſſions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon by our Divines, ſhould ſuſpect the Orthodoxy of that Religion which is accompanied with ſo bitter Fruits, even in the Diſpenſers of the Word as well as in others, and betake themſelves to the Communion of that Church, where how many and important ſoever their Differences be one with another, yet they do not break forth into thoſe Flames of Excommunicating and Perſecuting each other, that ours have done. How have ſome among us, through having their Spirits fretted and exaſperated by the craft and cunning of our Enemies, not onely loaded and ſtigmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed their Brethren and fellow Proteſtants with Crimes and Names, which, were they true, and deſerved, would juſtly render us a loathing and an Abomination to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, but having Libelled and Branded thoſe whom God had honoured to be Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Reformation, with Appellations and Characters fit to beget a Deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Doctrine as well as their Memory. The worſt that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have forged and vomited out againſt <hi>Luther, Zwinglius, Calvin,</hi> &amp;c. hath been raked up and repeated, to the diſparagement of the Reformation, and to the ſcandalizing the Minds of weak Men againſt it. And as the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> have improved thoſe Slanders and Calumnies to the ſeduction of diverſe from the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and to a working them over to a Reconciliation with the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo the Court hath thereby had an increaſe of their Faction and Party againſt our Religion and Liberties, and have been enabled to muſter Troops of <hi>Janiſaries</hi> for their Deſpotical and Unlimited Claim.</p>
            <p>Nor have our Diviſions, with the Heats, Animoſities, Revilings and Perſecutions that have enſued thereupon, proved onely an occaſion of the Seduction of ſeveral from our Religion, and of their Apoſtacy to <hi>Popery,</hi> but they have been a main ſpring and ſource of the Debauchery, Irreligion and Atheiſm, which have over ſpread the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and have brought ſo many both to an indifferency and unconcernedneſs for the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and all that is vertuous and noble, and have diſpoſed them to fall in with thoſe that could countenance and protect them in their Impiety and Prophaneneſs, and feed their Luxury and Pride with Honour and Gain. What a woful Scheme of Religion have we afforded the World! and how ſhamefully have we painted forth and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Holy Doctrine of the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> while we have not onely lived in a direct oppoſition to all the Commands of Meekneſs, Love and mutual Forbearance which our Religion lays us under the Authority of, but have neglected to practiſe good Manners, to obſerve the Rules of Civility, to treat one another with common Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and to do as we would be done unto? while we have been more offended at what ſeemed to ſupplant our Dominations and Grandeurs, than at what diſhonoured God and reproached the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> while we weighed not ſo much whether they whom we took into our Sacred Communion, as well as into our perſonal Friendſhip, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable in their Lives to the Scripture, as whether they complied with the Canons of the Church, while we reprobated all that were not of our way, though never ſo vertuous and devout, and Sainted all that were, though never ſo wicked and prophane; while we branded ſuch for Fanaticks, whom we could juſtly charge with nothing, ſave the not admitting that into Religion, which came not from the Divine Author of it; and hugged thoſe for good and Orthodox Believers, that would ſooner conſult the Statute-Book for their Practice in the Worſhip of God, than the Bible; while we haled thoſe to Priſon, and ſpoiled them of their Eſtates, to whom nothing could be objected, except their being too preciſe and conſciencious, in avoiding that, through fear and apprehenſion of ſinning, which others had a liberty and latitude to do, as judging it lawful; and in the mean time eſteemed thoſe worthy of the chiefeſt Truſts in the Church and Common-wealth, whoſe Folly and Villanies made them unfit for Civil Societies; while they who lived moſt agreeably to the Laws of God, and the Example of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> were perſecuted as Enemies to Religion, and the Peſts of the Kingdom, and, in the interim, too many of the very Clergy were not onely Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancers of the moſt Profligate Perſons, as their beſt Friends, but joined and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſcandalous Debaucheries, under pretence of ſuſtaining the Honour of their
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:48501:196"/>Tribe, and doing Service to the Church. I ſay, while theſe were the unhappy, but too obvious Fruits of our Diviſions, and of the bitter Heats that accompanied them, how was the Reverence for the Sacred Order leſſened and diminiſhed, the Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Religion weakned and loſt, the Shame and Dread of appearing prophane and wicked, removed and baniſhed; and ſuch who took the meaſures of Chriſtianity from the Practices of thoſe that were ſtiled Chriſtians, rather than from the immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and holy Scriptures, tempted to think all Religion a Juggle, and Prieſthood but an Artifice and Craft to compaſs Honour and Wealth. And though nothing but a ſhortneſs of Underſtanding, and an immoderate Love to their Luſts, could occaſion the drawing ſuch a Concluſion from the foregoing Premiſes, yet I muſt needs grant that there was too juſt a ground adminiſtred unto them of ſaying, that many did not believe that themſelves, the Faith whereof they recommended to others. But that which I would more particularly obſerve is, that it is from among thoſe, who by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going occaſions have been tempted to Debauchery and Irreligion, that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries have made the Harveſt of Proſelytes and Converts to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For as they who fear not God, will be eaſily brought to imitate <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and ſuch who are of no Religion, will in ſubſerviency to Secular Ends, aſſume the Mask and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of any: So Popery is extreamly adapted to the Wiſhes and Deſires of wicked and profane Men, in that it provides for their living as enormouſly as they pleaſe here, and flatters them with hopes and aſſurances of Bleſſedneſs hereafter. They who can be aſcertained of going to Heaven upon their confeſſing their Sins to a Prieſt and their receiving Abſolution, the Euchariſt and Extream Unction, need not look after Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance towards God, Converſion to Holineſs, nor a Life of Faith, Love, Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Obedience, which the Proteſtant Religion, upon the Authority of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, obligeth them unto, in order to the obtaining of Eternal Happineſs. And as the late Apoſtates to Popery in <hi>England,</hi> are chiefly ſuch who were notorious for Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Prophaneneſs and Immorality, and were the Scandal of our Religion while they profeſſed it; and while in our Church, were not properly of it: So it is from among Men of this ſtamp and character, that their late Majeſties have found Perſons aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſubſervient to their Deſpotical and Arbitrary Deſigns. <hi>For whoſoever takes a Survey of the Court-Faction, and conſidereth who have been the Advocates for Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon our Liberties, and Abetters of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations over our Rights, they will find them to have been principally the profligate and debauched among the Nobility and Gentry, the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary, ignorant and ſcandalous among the Clergy, the Off-ſcouring and ſuch as are an Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy to Human Nature among the Yeomanry and Peaſants.</hi> And it was in order to this villanous End, that the Royal Brothers have endeavoured ſo induſtriouſly to debauch the Nation, and have made <hi>Senſuality and Profaneneſs the Qualifications for Preferment, and the Badges of Loyalty.</hi> And if among thoſe that appear for the Preſervation of the Liberties of their Country, there be any that deſerve to be ſtiled Enemies to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Vertue, as I dare affirm that they owe their Immoralities to Court-Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Converſe and Example; ſo I hope that though they have not hitherto been all of them ſo happy as to have left their Vices where they learned them, yet that they will not continue to diſparage the good Cauſe which they have eſpouſed with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſutable Life, nor give their Adverſaries reaſon to ſay, that while they pretend to ſeek the Reformation of the State, they are both the Deriders of Sobriety and Vertue, without which no Conſtitution can long ſubſiſt, and guilty of ſuch horrid Oaths, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, Imprecations, Blaſphemies and uncleanneſſes, which naturally, as well as morally and meritoriouſly, diſpoſe Nations to Subverſion and Extirpation.</p>
            <p>Finally, Being through the bitter Effects which have enſued upon our Diviſions, made apprehenſive and jealous one of another, it hath from thence come to paſs, that while <hi>the Care of the Conformiſts hath been to watch againſt the growth of the Diſſenters; and the ſollicitude of the Nonconformiſts hath been, how to prevent the Rage of the bigot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Church-men,</hi> the Papiſts, in the mean time, without being heeded or obſerved, have both incredibly multiplied, and made conſiderable Advances in their deſigns of ruining us. For whenſoever the Court was to take a ſignal ſtep towards Popery and Arbitrary Power, there was a clamour raiſed of ſome menacing Boldneſs of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters. And if the Nation grew at any time alarmed, by reaſon of the Favour ſhewn to the Roman Catholicks, and of ſome viſible Progreſs made towards the Kings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Deſpotical, all was immediately huſh'd with a ſhout and cry of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Church's being in imminent hazard from the Diſſenters. Yea, whenſoever the Papiſts and their Royal Patrons ſtood detected, of having been conſpiring againſt our Religion and Civil Liberties, all was diverted and ſtifled, by putting the Kingdom upon a falſe Scent, and by hounding out their Beagles upon the Nonconformiſts. So
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:48501:197"/>that the Eyes and Minds of Proteſtants being imployed in reference to what was to be apprehended and feared from one another, the working of our Popiſh Enemies ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eſcaped our Obſervation, or were heeded by moſt, only with a ſuperficial and unaffective Glance. And while our Church-men ſtood prepoſſeſſed by the Court, with a dread and jealouſy of the Diſſenters, all that was ſaid and written of a Conſpiracy carryed on by the Papiſts againſt our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> was entertained and repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the prejudiced Clergy, as an Artifice only of the Diſſenters for compaſſing an Indulgence from the Parliament, which in caſe ſuch a Plot had obtained the belief, that a Matter of ſo great Danger and Conſequence required, would have been eaſily granted being the only rational Expedient for the preſervation of the eſtabliſhed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and the Legal Government. Nor did our Enemies queſtion but that having enflamed our Diviſions, and raiſed our Animoſities to ſo great a height, rather than the one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would lay aſide their Severities, and the other let fall their Reſentments, we would even be contented to lye at their Mercy, and ſubmit our ſelves to the Pleaſure and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the Court and Papiſts. And there have not wanted ſome peeviſh, fooliſh, and ill Men of both Parties, who rather than ſacrifice their Spleen and Paſſion, and abandon their particular Quarrels for the Intereſt and Safety of the whole, have been inclined to expoſe the Proteſtant Religion and Engliſh Liberties, to the Hazards wherewith they were apparently threatned, and to ſuffer all Extremities, meerly to have the ſatisfaction of ſeeing thoſe whom they reſpectively hate, involved with them under the ſame miſeries. But as this was ſuch a degree of Madneſs and Infatuation, as could proceed from nothing but brutiſh Rage, and argues no leſs than a Divine <hi>Neme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis;</hi> ſo, I hope, they are but few that now ſtand infected with theſe paſſionate Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Inclinations, and remain thus hardned in their mutual Prejudices. And to thoſe I have nothing to ſay, nor the leaſt Advice to adminiſter, but ſhall leave them to their own Follies, as Perſons to whoſe Conviction no Diſcourſe, though never ſo rational, can be adapted, and whom only Stripes can work upon.</p>
            <p>'Tis to ſuch therefore as are capable of hearkning to Reaſon, and who are ready to embrace any Counſel that ſhall be found adjuſted to the Common Intereſt, that I am to addreſs what remains to be repreſented and ſaid in the following Leaves. For all Parties of Proteſtants having ſeen how far our Enemies have improved our Diviſions and Rancours, to the compaſſing their wicked and ambitious Deſigns, and the robbing us of all that good and generous Men account valuable; they are at laſt convinced of the neceſſity we have been, and are reduced unto, of altering the meaſures of our acting towards one another, and both of laying aſide our Perſecutions, and of exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Wranglings among our ſelves, into a joint contending for the Faith of the Goſpel, and the Rights of the Nation. For what the Gentleman, ſo lately in the Throne, intends and aims at, is not any longer matter of meer Suſpicion and Jealouſy, but of demonſtrable Evidence and unqueſtionable Certainty.</p>
            <p>His Mask and Vizor of Zeal for the preſervation of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and of tender regard for the Laws of the Land, were laid by and put off, and his Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of governing Arbitrarily, and of introducing Popery, were become obvious to all Men, whom Reaſon and Senſe have not forſaken and left.</p>
            <p>The Papiſts, whom it was thought much, a while ago, to ſee connived at in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their Worſhip in private Houſes, are allowed now to practiſe their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try openly in our chief Towns, and in the Metropolitan City of the Kingdom to uſurp the publick Churches and Cathedrals. Thoſe Catholick Gentlemen, whom here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore it was matter of ſurpriſe to ſee countenanced with the private Favour of the Prince, are now advanced to the ſupream Commands in the Army, and the principal Truſt in Civil Affairs. The Recuſant Lords, whoſe enlargement out of the <hi>Tower,</hi> we could not but look upon as an unpreſidented Violation, both of the Laws of the Land, and of the Rights and Juriſdiction of Parliament, being committed thither by the Authority of the Houſe of Lords, upon a Charge and Impeachment of High Treaſon, by the Commons of <hi>England</hi> in Parliament aſſembled, were now honoured to be Members of the Privy Council, and exalted to be chief Miniſters of State. They whom the Statutes of the Realm make ſubject to the ſevereſt Penalties for Apoſtacy to <hi>Rome,</hi> are not only protected from the edg of the Laws, but maintained in Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Incumbencies, and Headſhips of Colledges.</p>
            <p>Our Orthodox Clergy are not only inhibited to preach againſt Popery, but are il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legally Reprimanded, Silenced, and Suſpended, for diſcharging that Duty which their Conſciences, Offices, Oaths, and the Laws of the Kingdom oblige them unto. And ſuch whom neither the Eccleſiaſtical nor <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Courts can arraign and proceed againſt, we have a new Court of Inquiſition erected for the adjudging and puniſhing
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:48501:197"/>of them. So that it is not the Diſſenters who are the only Perſons to be ſtruck at and ruined, but the Conformiſts are to be treated after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and to ſhare in the common Lot whereunto all honeſt and ſincere Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants are deſtined and deſigned. Even they who were the Darlings of <hi>Whitehall</hi> and St. <hi>Jameſes,</hi> and recompenſed with Honours and Titles for betraying the Rights and Priviledges of Corporations, perſecuting Diſſenters, and heading Addreſſes, wherein Parliaments were reproached, the Courſe of Juſtice againſt Popiſh Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders was ſlandered, the illegal and arbitrary procedures of the Court applauded and juſtified, and all that were zealous for our Laws and Liberties ſtigmatized with the names of <hi>Villains</hi> and <hi>Traitors,</hi> are now themſelves, for but diſcouraging Popiſh Aſſemblies, and attempting to put the Laws in execution againſt Prieſts who had publickly celebrated Maſs, not only check'd and rebuked, but puniſhed with Seiſure and Impriſonment.</p>
            <p>Nor are our Religion and Civil Liberties meerly ſupplanted and undermined by illegal Tricks, gloſſed over with the Varniſh of judicial Forms, but they are aſſaulted and battered in the face of the Sun, without ſo much as a pallia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to give their procedures a plauſible figure. And the King being brought to a deſpair of managing the Parliament to his barefaced Purpoſe of Popery and Arbitrarineſs, and of prevailing with them to eſtabliſh Tyranny and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry by Law, notwithſtanding their having been as induſtriouſly pack'd and choſen to anſwer ſuch a Deſign, as Art, Bribery and Authority could reach; and notwithſtanding their having been obſequious in their firſt Seſſion to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs that has proved unſafe to themſelves and the Nation, he became re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to allow them to meet any more, but to ſet up <hi>a-la-mode de France,</hi> and to his perſonal Commands, ſeconded with the Aſſent of his <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante-beneplacito</hi>-Judges, to be acknowledged and obeyed for Laws. So that they who were formerly ſeduced into a good Opinion of him, are not only undeceived, but provoked to warm Reſentments, for having had their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity and eaſineſs of belief ſo groſly abuſed. And as the converting ſo vaſt a number of well-meaning, but wofully deluded People, who had ſuffered themſelves to be hoodwink'd, and fatally hurried to betray their Religion, Country and Poſterity, to the Ambition and Popiſh Bigottry of the Court, was a deſign becoming the Compaſſion, Mercy and Wiſdom of God; ſo the Method's and Means whereby they are come to be enlightned and proſelyted, are a ſignal vindication of the Sapience and Righteouſneſs of God in all thoſe tremendous ſteps of his Providence, by which our Enemies have been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldned to detect and diſcover themſelves. For though their continuing ſo long to have a good opinion of the preſent King, and their abetting him ſo far in the undermining our Religion, and invading our Liberties, may ſeem to have proceeded not ſo much from their Ignorance as from their Obſtinacy and Malice; yet God, who penetrates into the Hearts of Men, may have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered ſome degrees of ſincerity in their Pretentions and Carriages, though ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a great deal of folly and unmanlineſs. Nor are the Lords ways like to ours, to give Perſons over as unteachable and irreclaimable, upon their withſtanding every meaſure of Light, and the reſiſting even thoſe Means which were ſufficient and proper for their Conviction; but he will try them by new and extraordinary Methods, and ſee whether Feeling and doleful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience may not convert thoſe, upon whom Arguments and Moral Evidence could make no impreſſions. And there being among thoſe formerly miſled and deluded Proteſtants, many who retained a Love for their Country, a Care for their Poſterity, and a Zeal for the Goſpel and Reformed Religion, even when their Actions imported the contrary, and ſeem'd to betray them; the ſingling and weeding out ſuch from among the Court-Faction and Party, is a compenſation both for the defeatment of all endeavours, for the prevention of the Evils that have overtaken us, and for the Diſtreſſes and Calamities under which we do at preſent lie and groan. And if there be joy in Heaven upon the converſion of a Sinner, with what thankfulneſs to God, and joy in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſhould they who have ſo many years wreſtled againſt the encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Popery and Arbitrarineſs, and who have deeply ſuffered in their Names, Perſons and Eſtates upon that account, welcome and embrace their once erring and miſled, but now enlightned, reclaimed and converted Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? And in ſtead of remembring or upbraiding them with the oppoſition and rancour which they expreſſed againſt our Perſons, Principles, and Ways,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:48501:198"/>let there be no Language heard from us, but what may declare the joy we have in our ſelves for their converſion, and the entire truſt and confidence which we put in them.</p>
            <p>The firſt Duty incumbent therefore upon Diſſenters towards thoſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is to believe, that notwithſtanding there have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them ſo long Advocates and Partiſans for the Court, through ignorance of what was aimed at and intended, they are nevertheleſs as really concerned as any others, and as truly zealous for the preſervation of the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and for maintaining the legal Rights and Liberties of the Subject, and when occaſion ſhall offer, will approve themſelves accordingly. <hi>'Tis a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, as well as a miſchievous Fancy, for one Party to confine all Religion only to themſelves, or to circumſcribe all the ancient Engliſh Ardor for the common Rights of the Nation, to ſuch as are of their particular Fellowſhip and Perſwaſion, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſincere Chriſtians, and true Engliſhmen among thoſe of all Judgments and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties of Proteſtants, and among none more than thoſe of the Communion of the Church of</hi> England. It were the height of Wickedneſs, as well as the moſt prodigious Folly, to imagine that the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> have abandoned all Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God, and caſt off all care of themſelves and their Country, upon a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken Judgment of being Loyal and Obedient to the King. The contrary is plain enough; they knew as well as any, that the giving to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the Things that are <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s, lay them under no Obligation of ſurrendring unto him the Things that are God's; nor of ſacrificing unto the Will of the Sovereign the Priviledges reſerved unto the People by the Fundamental Rules of the Conſtitution, and by the Statutes of the Realm. And they underſtand, as well as others, that the Laws of the Land are the only meaſures of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce's Authority, and of the Subjects Fealty; and where they give him no Right to Command, they lay them under no tye to Obey. And though here and there a Diſſenter has written againſt Popery with good Succeſs, yet they have been moſtly Conformable Divines, who have triumphed over it in elaborate Diſcourſes, and who have beaten the Romiſh Scriblers off the Stage. Nor can it be thought that they who have ſo accurately related and vindicated the Hiſtory, and aſſerted and defended the Doctrine of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, ſhould either tamely relinquiſh, or be wanting in all due and legal Ways to uphold and maintain it. And though ſome few of the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts have, with ſufficient ſtrength and applauſe, uſed their Pens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Arbitrarineſs, in detecting the Deſigns of the Royal Brothers, yet they who have generally, and with greateſt Honour, appeared for our Laws and Legal Government, againſt the Invaſions and Uſurpations of the Court, have been Theologues and Gentlemen of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Nor in caſe of further Attempts for altering the Conſtitution, and enſlaving the Nation, will they ſhew themſelves unworthy the having deſcended from Anceſtors, whoſe Motto in the high Places of the Field was, <hi>nolumus Leges Angliae mutari,</hi> They who have ſo often juſtified the Arms of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Netherlands</hi> againſt their Rightful Princes the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſo unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably vindicated their caſting off Obedience to thoſe Monarchs, when they had invaded their Priviledges, and attempted to eſtabliſh the <hi>Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> over them, cannot be ignorant what their own Right and Duty is in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Proteſtant Religion and Engliſh Liberties; for the Security where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we have not only ſo many Laws, but the Coronation Oaths, and Stipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Kings.</p>
            <p>And thoſe Gentlemen of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who appeared ſo vigorouſly in three Parliaments for excluding the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> from the Succeſſion to the Crown, by reaſon of a Jealouſy of what, through being a Papiſt, he would attempt againſt our Religion and Priviledges, in caſe he were ſuffered to aſcend the Throne; cannot be now to ſeek what becomes them towards him, having ſeen and felt what before they only apprehended and feared. For if the Law that entaileth the Succeſſion upon the next of Kin, and obligeth the Subjects to admit and receive him, not only may, but ought to be diſpenſed with, in caſe the Heir, thro' having imbib'd Principles which threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Safety, and are inconſiſtent with the Happineſs of the People, hath made himſelf incapable to inherit, we know, by a ſhort Ratiocination, how far we ſtand bound to a Prince on the Throne, who by Tranſgreſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Laws of the Conſtitution, hath abdicated himſelf from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:48501:198"/>and ſtands virtually Depoſed. For <hi>whoſoever ſhall offer to Rule Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarily, does immediately ceaſe to be King</hi> de jure, <hi>ſeeing by the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, Common, and Statute Laws of the Realm, we know none for Supream Magiſtrate and Governor, but a limited Prince, and one who ſtands circumſcribed and bounded in his Power and Prerogative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſhould the Diſſenters entertain a belief that the Conformiſts are leſs concerned and zealous than themſelves for the Proteſtant Religion and Laws of the Kingdom, they would not only Sin, and offend againſt the Rules of Charity, but againſt the Meaſures of Juſtice, and daily Evidences from Matters of Fact. For neither they, nor we, owe our Converſion to God, and our practical Holineſs to the Opinions about Diſcipline, Forms of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and Ceremonies, wherein we differ, but the Doctrines of Faith and Chriſtian Obedience, wherein we agree. 'Tis not their being for a Liturgy, a Surpliſs, or a Biſhop, that hath heretofore influenced them to ſubſerve the Court in Deſigns tending to Abſoluteneſs, but they were ſeduced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, upon Motives whereof they are now aſhamed; and the ridiculouſneſs and folly of which they have at laſt diſcever'd. Nor is <hi>the multitude of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate and ſcandalous perſons with which the Church of</hi> England <hi>is crowded,</hi> any juſt impeachment of the Purity of her Doctrine in the Vitals and Eſſentials of Religion, or of the Vertue and Piety of many of her Members. For as it is her being the only Society eſtabliſhed by Law that attracts thoſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min to her Boſom, ſo it is her being reſtrained by Law from debarring them, that keeps them there to her reproach, and to the grief of many of her Eccleſiaſticks. Neither is it the fault of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that the Agents and Factors for Popery and Arbitrary Power, have choſen to paſs under the name of <hi>her Sons;</hi> but it proceeds partly from their Malice, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping by that means to diſgrace her with all true Engliſh-men, as well as with Diſſenters; and partly from their Craft, in order thereby the better to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal their Deſign, and to ſhrowd themſelves from the Cenſure and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which had it not been for that Mask, they would have been expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto, and have undergone. And I dare affirm, that beſides the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from Religion, which the Conformiſts are equally under with Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for hindring the introduction of Popery, there are ſeveral Inducements from intereſt which ſway them to prevent its eſtabliſhment, wherein the Diſſenters are but little concerned. For though Popery would be alike af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive to the Conſciences of Proteſtants of all Perſuaſions, yet they are Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whole Livings, Revenues, and Eſtates have been threatned in caſe it had come to be eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>Nor would the moſt Loyal and obſequious Levites, provided they reſolve to continue Proteſtants, be willing that their Perſonages and Incumbencies, to which they have have no leſs Right by Law, than the King hath to the Exciſe and Cuſtoms, ſhould be taken from them, and beſtowed upon Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Prieſts, by an Act of Deſpotical Power, and of unlimited Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative. And for the Gentlemen, as I think few of them would hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to part with their purſes to High-way-Padders, though ſuch ſhould have a pattent from the King to rob whomſoever they met upon the Road; ſo there will not be many inclined to ſuffer their Mannours and Abbey-Lands, to which they have ſo good a Title, to be raviſhed from them, either by Monks or Janizaries, though authoriſed thereunto by the Princes Commiſſion. Even they who had formerly ſuffered themſelves to be ſeduced, to prove in a manner, Betrayers of the Rights and Religion of their Country, will now (being undeceived) not only in conjunction with others, withſtand the Court in its proſecution of Popiſh and Arbitrary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; but through a generous exaſperation. for having been deluded and abuſed, will judge themſelves obliged, in vindication of their Actings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to appear for the Proteſtant Religion, and the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> with a Zeal equal to that wherewith they contributed to the undermining and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting of them. For they are not only become more ſenſible than they were of the Miſchiefs of Abſolute Government, ſo as for the future to prize and aſſert the Priviledges reſerved unto the people by the Rules of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and chalk'd out for them in the Laws of the Land; but they have ſuch a freſh view of Popery, both in its Hereſies, Blaſphemies, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, and Idolatries; and in the Treachery, Sanguinarineſs, Violence and Cruelty which the Papal Principles mould, influence, and oblige Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:48501:199"/>that they not only entertain the greateſt abhorrency and deteſtation ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable for it, but ſeem reſolved not to cheriſh in their Boſom, a Thing ſo abominable to God, execrable to good Men, and deſtructive to Humane as well as to Chriſtian Societies.</p>
            <p>Nor are the Diſſenters meerly to believe that the Conformiſts are equally zealous as themſelves for the Reformed Religion, and Engliſh Rights, but they are to conſider them as the only great and united Body of Proteſtants in the Kingdom, with whom all other parties compared bear no conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proportion. For though the Nonconformiſts, conſidered abſtractly, make a vaſt number of honeſt and uſeful people, yet being laid in the Scale with thoſe of the Epiſcopal Communion, they are but few, and lye in a little room. And whoſoever will take the pains to ballance the one againſt the other, even where Diſſenters make the greateſt Figure, and may juſtly boaſt of their Multitude, they will ſoon be convinced that the number of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth far tranſcend and exceed them. And if it be ſo in Cities and Corporations, where the greateſt Bulk of Diſſenters are, it is much more ſo in Country Pariſhes, where the latter bear not the proportion of one to a hundred. Nor doth the Church of <hi>England</hi> more exceed the other parties in her number, than ſhe doth in the quality of her Members. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they who make up and conſtitute the ſeparate Societies; are chiefly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the middle Rank and Condition, the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth in a manner vouch, and claim all the Perſons of Honour, of the Learned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, and ſuch as have valuable Eſtates, for her Communicants. And though the other ſort are as neceſſary in the Common-wealth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute as much to its Strength, Proſperity, and Happineſs, yet they make not that Figure in the Government, nor ſtand in that Capacity of having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon Publick Affairs. For not only the Gentlemen of both the Gowns, who by reaſon of their Calling and Learning are beſt able to defend our Religion, and vindicate our Laws and Priviledges with their Tongues and Pens, but they whoſe Eſtates, Reputation and Intereſt, recommendeth them to be elected Members of the great Senate of the Nation, as well as they, who by reaſon of their Honours and Baronages, are Hereditary Legiſlators, are generally, if not all, of the Communion of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> So, that they who conform to the eſtabliſhed Worſhip and Diſcipline, are to be look'd upon and acknowledged as the great Bulwark of the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in <hi>England,</hi> and the Hedge and Fence of our Civil Liberties and Rights.</p>
            <p>And though it be true, that this great Breach made upon our Religion and Laws is fallen out under their hand, while the poor Diſſenters had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acceſſion to, nor were in a condition to prevent it; yet ſeeing their own Conſciences do ſufficiently load and charge them for it with Shame and Ignominy, it were neither candid, nor at this Juncture ſeaſonable to upbraid it to them, or improve it to their Diſhonour and Reproach. For as they have tamely look'd on and connived till our Religion and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are ſo far undermined and ſupplanted; ſo it is they alone who have been in a condition of ſtemming the Inundation of Idolatry and Tyranny, with which we were threatned, and of repairing our Breaches, and reducing the Prerogative to its old Channel, and making Popery ſneak and retreat into its holes and corners again. And ſhould the Church of <hi>England</hi> have been overthrown and devoured, what an eaſie Prey would the reſt have been to the Romiſh Cormorants! And could the King, under the Conduct of the Jeſuits, and with the aſſiſtance of his <hi>Myrmidons,</hi> have diſſolved the eſtabliſhed Worſhip and Diſcipline, they of the Separation would have been in no capacity to ſupport the Reformed Religion, nor able to eſcape the common Ruine and Perſecution. 'Tis therefore the Intereſt, as well as the Duty of the Diſſenters, to help, maintain and defend thoſe Walls, within the skreen and ſhelter whereof their own Huts and Cottages are built and ſtand. And the rather ſeeing the Conformiſts are at laſt, though to their own Religion's, and the Nations Expence, become ſo far enlightned, as to ſee a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of growing more amicable towards them, and to enlarge the Terms of their Communion, grant an Indulgence to all Proteſtants that differ from them. And as we ought to admire the Wiſdom of God in thoſe Providences, by which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants are taught to lay aſide their Animoſities, and let fall their Perſecutions of one another; ſo it would be a Contradiction both to the principles and repeated Proteſtations of Diſſenters, to aim at more than ſuch a Liberty as
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:48501:199"/>is conſiſtent with a National Eccleſiaſtick Eſtabliſhment. Yea it were to proclaim themſelves both Villains and Hypocrites, not to allow their Fellow-Proteſtants the Exerciſe of their Judgments, with what further Profits and Emoluments the Law will grant them, provided themſelves may be diſcharged from all obnoxiouſneſs to Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Cenſures upon the account of their Conſciences, and be admitted a free and publick Practice of their own reſpective Modes of Diſcipline, and be ſuffered to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in thoſe ways which they think he hath required and enjoyned them. And were <hi>England</hi> immediately to be rendred ſo happy as to have a Proteſtant Prince or Princeſs (as we are not now quite out of hopes) aſcend the Throne, and to enjoy a Parliament duly choſen, and acting with freedom, no one party of the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion among us, muſt ever expect to be eſtabliſhed and ſupported to the denial of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to others, much leſs to be by Law empowered to ruine and deſtroy them. Should it pleaſe Almighty God, to bring the Princeſs of <hi>Orange</hi> to the Crown, though the Church of <hi>England</hi> may in that caſe juſtly expect the being preſerved and upheld as the National Eſtabliſhment, yet all other Proteſtants may very rationally promiſe themſelves an Indulgence, and that not only from the Mildneſs and compaſſionate Sweetneſs of her Temper, but from the Influence which the Prince her Husband will have upon her, who, as he is deſcended from Anceſtors, whoſe Glory it was to be the Redeemers of their Country from Papal Perſecution and Spaniſh Tyranny; ſo his Education, Generoſity, Wiſdom, and many Heroick Vertues, diſpoſe him to embrace all Proteſtants with an equal Tenderneſs, and to erect his Intereſt upon the being Head and Patron of all that profeſs the Reformed Religion. Had the late Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> been victorious againſt the Forces of the preſent King, and inabled to have wreſted the Scepter out of his Hand, though all Proteſtants might thereupon have expected, and would certainly have enjoyed an equal freedom, without the liableneſs of any party to Penal Laws for matters of Religion, yet he would have been careful; and I have reaſon to believe that it was his purpoſe to have had the Church of <hi>Eng.</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and maintained, and that ſhe ſhould have ſuffered no alteration but what would have been to her Strength and Glory, through an enlargement of the Terms of her Communion, and what would have been to the Praiſe of her Moderation and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty through her being perſwaded to bear with ſuch as differ from her in little things, and could not prevail with themſelves to partake with her in all Ordinances. Upon the whole, it is both the prudence and ſafety of Diſſenters, as they would eſcape Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation themſelves, and have Religion conveyed down to Poſterity, to unite their Strength and Endeavours to thoſe of the Church of <hi>England</hi> for the upholding her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the aſſaults of Popiſh Enemies, who purſue her Subverſion. As matters have been circumſtanced and ſtated in <hi>England,</hi> there hath not been an Affront or Injury of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered or done unto her by the Court, which did not at the ſame time reach and wound the Diſſenters. 'Tis not her being for Epiſcopacy, Ceremonies, and impoſed Set-Forms of Worſhip, the things about which ſhe and the Nonconformiſts differ, that ſhe hath been, not long ſince maligned and ſtruck at by the Man in Power, and his Popiſh <hi>functo;</hi> but it is for being Proteſtant, Reformed, and Orthodox, Crimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Guilt whereof Diſſenters were equally concerned and involved. Being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in oppoſition to the common Cauſe of Religion, that the late Court of Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was erected over her Eccleſiaſticks, all Proteſtants jointly reſented the Wrongs which ſhe ſuſtain'd, and not only to ſympathize with thoſe dignified and lower Clergy which were called to ſuffer, but to eſpouſe her Quarrel with the ſame warmth that we would our own.</p>
            <p>And as we are to look upon thoſe of the Epiſcopal Communion, to be the great Bulwark of the Proteſtant Religion and Reformed Intereſt in <hi>England;</hi> ſo it was far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incumbent on Diſſenters towards them, and a Duty which they owe to God, the Nation, and themſelves, not to be acceſſary to any thing through which the legal Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the Church of <hi>England</hi> might have been, by an Act of pretended Regal Prerogative, weakned and ſupplanted.</p>
            <p>I never counſel the Diſſenters to renounce their Principles, nor to participate with the Prelatical Church in all Ordinances, on the Terms to which they have ſtraitned and narrowed their Communion. For while they remain unſatisfied of the lawfulneſs of thoſe Terms and Conditions, they cannot do it without offending God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting Guilt upon their Souls; nor will they of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in Charity, Juſtice and Honeſty, expect it from them. For whatſoever any Man believeth to be Sin, it is ſo to him, and will by God be imputed as ſuch, till he be otherwiſe enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and convinced; nor are the Diſſenters to be falſe and cruel to themſelves, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be kind and friendly to them. But that which I would adviſe them unto is, that after the maintaining the higheſt meaſure of Love to the conformable Congregations
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:48501:200"/>as Churches of Chriſt, and the eſteeming their Members as Chriſtian Proteſtant Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, notwithſtanding the ſeveral things wherein they judge them to err, and to be miſtaken, that they would not by any Act and Tranſactions of theirs, betray them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Deſpotical Power, not directly, nor indirectly acknowledge any Authority para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount unto, and ſuperſeding the Laws, by which the Church of <hi>England</hi> is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its preſent Form, Order, and Mode of Juriſdiction, Diſcipline and External Worſhip.</p>
            <p>Whatſoever Eaſe arrived to the Diſſenters, through the Kings ſuſpending the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Penal Laws, without their Addreſs and Application, they might receive it with Joy and Humility in themſelves, and with thankfulneſs to God, nor was there hereby any prejudice offered on their part, to the Authority of the Law, or Offence or Injury given or done to the conformable Clergy. Nor is it without grief and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret that the Church-men have been forced to behold the haraſſing, ſpoiling, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment of the Nonconformiſts, while in the mean time the Papiſts were ſuffered to aſſemble to the Celebration of their Idolatrous Worſhip without Cenſure and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul. And had it been in their power to remedy it, and give Relief to their Proteſtant Brethren, they would with delight and readineſs have embrac'd the occaſion and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of doing it. But alas! inſtead of having an advantage put into their hand, of contributing to the Relief of the Diſſenters, which I dare ſay, many of them ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently wiſh and deſire, they were compelled, contrary to their Inclination, as well as their Intereſt, to become inſtrumental in perſecuting and oppreſſing them. Nor does the late King covet a better and a more legal advantage againſt the Conformiſts, than that they would refuſe to purſue Diſſenters, and decline moleſting them with Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures and civil Puniſhments. So that their condition was to be pityed and bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in that they were hindered from acting againſt the Papiſts, though both enjoyed by Law, and influenced thereunto by Motives of ſelf-Preſervation, as well as by tyes of Conſcience, while in the mean time they were forced to proſecute their fellow-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, or elſe to be ſuſpended and depoſed, and put out of their Offices and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And tho I believe that they would at laſt have more Peace in themſelves, and be better accepted with God in the great Duty of their Account, ſhould they have refuſed to diſturb and proſecute their Proteſtant Brethren, and ſcorn to be any longer Court-Tools for weakning and undermining the Reformed Cauſe and Intereſt, yet I could not but leave them to act in this as they ſhould be perſwaded in themſelves, and as they judged moſt agreeable to Principles of Wiſdom and Conſcience. In the interim, the Diſſenters have all the Reaſon in the World to believe, that the Proceedings of the Clergy and Members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> againſt them, were not the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults of their Election and Choice, but the Effects of moral Compulſion and Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. Nor will any Diſſenter that is prudent and diſcreet, blame them for a matter which they cannot help, but bear his Misfortune and Lot with Patience in himſelf, and with Compaſſion and Charity towards them; and have his Indignation raiſed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt that Court, which forced them to be inſtrumental in their Oppreſſion and Trouble. The Proteſtant Diſſenters could not be ſo far void of ſenſe, as to think that the Perſon lately in the Throne bore them any good-Will, but <hi>his drift was to ſcrew himſelf into a Supremacy and Abſoluteneſs over the Law, and to get ſuch an Authority con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to be veſted in him, as when he pleaſed he might ſubvert the Eſtabliſhed Religion, and ſet up Popery.</hi> Forby the ſame Power that he can diſpenſe with the Penal Statutes againſt the Nonconformiſts, he may alſo diſpenſe with thoſe againſt the Roman Catholicks. And whoſoever owneth that he hath a Right to do the firſt, doth in effect own that he hath a Right to do the laſt. For if he be allowed a Power for the ſuperſeding ſome Laws made in reference to Matters of Religion, he may challenge the like Power for the ſuperſeding others of the ſame kind. And then by the ſame Authority that he can ſuſpend the Laws againſt Popery, he may alſo ſuſpend thoſe for Proteſtancy. And by the ſame Power that he can, in defiance of Law, indulge the Papiſts the Exerciſe of their Religion in Houſes, he may eſtabliſh them in the publick Celebration of their Idolatry in Churches and Cathedrals. yea, whereas the Laws that relate to Religion are enacted by no leſs Authority, than thoſe that are made for the Preſervation of our Civil Rights, ſhould the K. be admitted to have an Arbitrary Power over the one it is very like that by the Logick of <hi>Whitehall</hi> he might have challeng'd the ſame Abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs over the other. <hi>Nor do I doubt but that the</hi> eleven Judges, <hi>who gratified him with a Deſpoticalneſs over the former, would, when required, grant him the ſame over the latter.</hi> I know the Diſſenters have been under no ſmall Temptations, both by reaſon of being hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from enjoying the Ordinances of the Goſpel, and becauſe of many grievous Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which they ſuffer for their Nonconformity of making Applications to the K. for ſome Relief by his ſuſpending the Execution of the Laws; but they muſt give me leave to
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:48501:200"/>add, that they ought not, for the obtaining of a little Eaſe, to have betrayed the Kingdom, and Sacrifice the Legal Conſtitution of the Government to the Luſt and Pleaſure of a Popiſh Prince, whom nothing leſs would ſerve than being Abſolute and Deſpotical. And had he once been in the quiet Poſſeſſion of an Authority to diſpenſe with the Penal Laws, the Diſſenters would not long have enjoyed the Benefit of it. Nor could they have denied him a Power of reviving the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Law, which is part of the Truſt depoſited with him as Supreme Magiſtrate, who have granted him a Power of Suſpending the Laws, which the Rules of the Government precluded him from. And as he might, whenſoever he pleaſed, cauſe the Laws, to which they were Obnoxious, to be executed upon them; ſo by virtue of having an Authority acknowledged in him of ſuperceding the Laws, he might deprive them of the Liberty of meeting together to the number of Five, a Grace which the Parliament thought fit to allow them, under all the other Severities to which they were ſubjected. Nor needs there any further Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that the Prince's challenging ſuch a Power was an Uſurpation, and that the Subjects making any Application, by which it ſeem'd allowed to him, was a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying of the Ancient Legal Government of the Kingdom; whereas the moſt Obſequious and Servile Parliament to the Court that ever <hi>England</hi> knew, not only denied this Prerogative to the late King <hi>Charles,</hi> but made him renounce it by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking his Declaration of Indulgence which he had emitted <hi>Anno</hi> 1672.</p>
            <p>And as it will be to the perpetual Honour of ſome of the Diſſenters, to have choſen rather to ſuffer the Severities which the Laws make them liable unto, than by any Act and Tranſaction of theirs, to undermine and weaken either the Church or the State; ſo it will be a means both of endearing them, we hope, not only to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> now by a miraculous Providence brought in amongſt us, but to future Parliaments, and of bringing them and the Conformiſts into an Union of Counſels and Endeavours againſt Popery and Tyranny for ever; which is at this ſeaſon a thing ſo indiſpenſibly neceſſary for their common Preſervation. Eſpecially when through a new and more threatning Alliance and Confederacy with <hi>France,</hi> than that in 72, the King had not only engaged to act by and obſerve the ſame Meaſures towards Proteſtants in <hi>England,</hi> which that Monarch hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed the World a Pattern and Copy of in his carriage towards thoſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion in <hi>France;</hi> but had promiſed to diſturb the Peace and Repoſe of his Neighbours, and to commence a War, in conjunction with that Prince, againſt Foreign Proteſtants. For as the King's giving Liberty and Protection to the <hi>Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines</hi> to frequent his Havens, and ſell the Prizes which they take from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> is both a moſt infamous Action for a Prince, pretending to be a Chriſtian, and a direct Violation of his Alliance with the <hi>States General;</hi> ſo nothing can be more evident, than that he thereby ſought to render them the weaker for him to aſſault, and that he was reſolved (if ſome unforeſeen and extraordinary Providence had not interpoſed and prevented) to declare War againſt them the next Summer; in order whereunto great Remiſes of Money were already ordered him from the French Court. So that the Indulgence which he pretends to be inclinable to afford the Diſſenters, was not an effect of Kindneſs and Good-will, but an Artifice whereby to oblige their Aſſiſtance in deſtroying thoſe Abroad of the ſame Religion with themſelves. Which if he could once compaſs, it were eaſie to foreſee what Fate both the Diſſenters, and they of the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> were to expect. Who as they would not then have known whither to retreat for ſhelter; ſo they would have been deſtitute of Comfort in themſelves, and deprived of Pity from others; not only for having, through their Diviſions, made themſelves a Prey to the Papiſts at Home, but for having been acceſſary to the Ruin of the Reformed State Abroad; and which was the <hi>Aſilum</hi> and Sanctuary of all thoſe that were elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where oppreſſed and perſecuted for Religion.</p>

            <p>THey are great Strangers to the Tranſactions of the World, who know not how many and various the Attempts of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have been, both to hinder all Endeavours towards a <hi>Reformation,</hi> and to overthrow and ſubvert it where <hi>it</hi> hath obtained and prevailed. For beſide the innumerable Executions and Murthers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by means of the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> to cruſh and ſtifle the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> in its Riſe and Birth, and to prevent its Succeeding and Settlement in <hi>Spain, Italy,</hi> and many other <hi>Territories;</hi> there is no <hi>Kingdom</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> where it hath ſo far prevailed as to come to be univerſally received and legally eſtabliſhed, but it hath been through ſtrange and wonderful Conflicts with the Rage and Malice of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions which the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> underwent by vertue of the <hi>Edicts</hi> of the <hi>Pagan Emperors,</hi> were not more Sanguinary and Cruel, than what through the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> of <hi>Popiſh Princes,</hi> have been inflicted upon thoſe, who have teſtified againſt the Hereſies, Superſtitions, and Idolatries, and have withdrawn from the Communion of the <hi>Papal Church.</hi> Nor were the <hi>Martyrs</hi> that ſuffered for the Teſtimony of <hi>Jeſus</hi> againſt <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> either more numerous or worthier of eſteem for Virtue, Juſtice and Piety, than they who have been ſlaughtered, upon no other Pretence, but for Endeavouring to reſtore the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> to the Simplicity and Purity of its Divine and firſt <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> and to recover it from the Corruptions, wherewith it was become univerſally Tainted in Doctrine, Worſhip and Diſcipline. How have all the Nations in <hi>Europe</hi> been ſoak'd with the Blood of Saints, through the Barbarous Rage of <hi>Popiſh Rulers,</hi> whom the <hi>Roman Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> ſtirred up and inſtigated, in order to ſupport themſelves in their ſecular Grandeur, and in their Tyranny over the Conſciences of Men, and to keep the World in Slavery under Ignorance, Errors, Superſtition and Idolatry, which the reducing Chriſtianity again to the Rule of the Goſpel, would have redeemed Mankind from, and been an effectual Means to have Diſſipated and Subverted? They of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, having ſtrangely cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the Chriſtian Religion in its Faith, Worſhip and Diſcipline, and having prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly altered it, from what it was in the Doctrines and Inſtitutions of our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> they found no otherway whereby to ſuſtain their Errors and Corruptions, and to preſerve themſelves in the Poſſeſſion of that Empire, which they had uſurped over Conſcience, and in the Enjoyment of the Wealth and ſecular Greatneſs, which by working upon the Ignorance, Superſtition, Luſts, and Prophaneneſs of People, they had skrewed and wound themſelves into, but by adjudging all who durſt detect or oppoſe them, to Fire and Sword, or to Miſeries, to which Death in its worſt ſhape were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrable. Nor have they for the better obſtructing the Growth, and compaſſing the Extirpation of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> omitted either the Arts and Subtleties of <hi>Julian,</hi> or the Fury and Violence of <hi>Galerius</hi> and <hi>Diocleſian.</hi> Whoſoever hath not obſerved the Craft and Rage that have been employed and exerted againſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> for theſe 170 Years, muſt have been very little Converſant in Hiſtories, and ſtrangely overlook'd the Conduct of Affairs in the World, and the Tranſactions in Churches and States, during their own time. And tho the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do not think it fit, to put their <hi>Maxims</hi> for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> and converting <hi>Hereticks,</hi> in Execution at all times, and in every place, yet ſome of their Writers are ſo Ingenuous, as to tell us the reaſon of it, and that they do not forbear it upon Principles of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> or <hi>good Nature,</hi> but upon Motives of <hi>Policy</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> leſt the cutting one of our Throats might endanger two of their own However they have been careful not to ſuffer a period of <hi>twenty Years</hi> to clapſe ſince the beginning of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> without affording us in ſome place or another, renewed Evidences of <hi>Papal</hi> Charity, and of the <hi>Roman</hi> Method of hindering the Growth of Hereſie, either by a Maſſacre, War, or Perſecution, begun, and executed, upon no other Account or Provocation, but merely that of our <hi>Religion,</hi> and becauſe we cannot believe and practiſe in the Matters of God, as they do. And having obtained of late, great Advantages for the purſuing their Malice againſt us, more boldly and avowedly than at another Seaſon, and that not only through a ſtrange Concurrence and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of <hi>Princes</hi> in the <hi>Papal</hi> Communion, who are more intoxicated with their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:48501:201"/>and Idolatries, or leſs wiſe, merciful, and humane, than ſome of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors of that Fellowſhip were, but through having obtained a <hi>Prince</hi> intirely devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them, and under the implicit guidance of their Prieſts, to be advanced unto a Throne, where ſuch ſometime uſed to ſit, as were the Terror of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> and the Sanctuary of oppreſſed <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> they have thereupon both aſſumed a Courage of ſtirring up new and unpreſidented Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in divers places, againſt the moſt uſeful, beſt and loyalleſt of Subjects, upon no other Charge or Allegation, but for diſſenting for the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Faith, and deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Subjection to the Tripple Crown, and are raiſed into a Confidence of wholly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpating <hi>Proteſtancy,</hi> and of re-eſtabliſhing the <hi>Papal</hi> Tyrannies and Superſtition, in the ſeveral <hi>Countries</hi> whence they had been expelled, or ſtood ſo depreſſed and diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced, as that the Votaries and Partizans of their <hi>Church,</hi> had not the Sway and Domination. Nor need we any other Conviction, both of their Deſign, and of their Confidence of Succeeding in it, than what they have already done, and continue to purſue in <hi>France, Hungary</hi> and <hi>Piedmont,</hi> where their proſpering to ſuch a degree in their Cruel and Barbarous Attempts, not only gives them boldneſs of entertaining thoughts of taking the like Methods, and Acting by the ſame Meaſures, in all Places where they find Rulers at their beck, and under their Influence, but to unite and provoke all <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Monarchs</hi> to enter into a holy War againſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> every where, that by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering and Subduing thoſe <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> where the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> is receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and eſtabliſhed, they may extirpate it out of the World, under the Notion of the <hi>Northern</hi> Hereſie. If Principles of Humanity, Maxims of Intereſt, Rules of Policy, Obligations of Gratitude, Ties of Royal and Princely Faith, or the repeated Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, Oaths, Edicts, and Declarations of Sovereigns, could have been a Security to <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> for the Profeſſion of their Faith, and Exerciſe of their Worſhip, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Territories and Dominions, they had all that could be rationally deſired, for their Safety and Protection, in the free and open Profeſſion and Practice of their <hi>Religion;</hi> whereas by a Violation of all that is Sacred among Men, of a binding Virtue unto Princes (except Chains and Fetters) or that confer a Right, Claim, and Security unto Subjects, the poor <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in thoſe Places, have been, and ſtill are, Perſecuted with a Rage and Barbarity, which no Age can parallel, and for which it is difficult to find words proper and ſevere enough, whereby to ſtamp a Character of Infamy, upon the treacherous, cruel, and ſavage Authors, Promoters, and Inſtruments of it. Nor does it proceed from a Malignancy of Nature peculiar to the <hi>Emperor,</hi> the <hi>French King,</hi> and the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> above what is in other <hi>Princes</hi> of the ſame Communion, or that they are more regardleſs of Fame, and leſs concerned how future Generations will brand their Memories, than other <hi>Papal Monarchs</hi> ſeem to be, that they have ſuffered themſelves to be prevailed upon, to violate the Promiſes and Oaths they were bound by to their <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Subjects; ſeeing the <hi>Emperor</hi> is character'd for a Perſon of a meek and gentle Temper, and of the goodneſs of whoſe Nature, there remain ſome ſhadows interwoven with the bloody ſtreaks of the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Perſecution. And the <hi>French King,</hi> though he ſtand not much commended for Sweetneſs and Benignity of Diſpoſition, is known to be unmeaſurably Ambitious, of having his name tranſmitted to Poſterity in Letters of Greatneſs and Honor, which his behaviour towards his Subjects of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion,</hi> is no ways adapted unto, but calculated to make him hereafter liſted with <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Julian.</hi> As to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> there ſeems by the whole courſe of his other Actions, to be a certain Greatneſs of Mind in him, not eaſily conſiſting with that ſavage and brutal Temper, which the Cruelties he hath exerciſed upon the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> would intimate and denote. But it ariſeth from the Miſchievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Peſtilency of their Religion, their Bigottry in it, and their having put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo entirely under the conduct of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> particularly of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who are for the moſt part a Sett of Men, eſpecially the latter, that through acting in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of no other Ends, but the Grandeur, Wealth, and Domination of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> do with an unlimited Rage, and a peculiar kind of Malice, perſecute all that have renounced Fellowſhip with it, and care not if they Sacrifice the Honor, Glory and Safety of <hi>Monarchs,</hi> and bring their Kingdoms into Contempt and Deſolation, by rending them weak, poor, and diſpeopled, provided they may wreek their Spleen, and Revenge upon thoſe, whoſe Religion is not only diſſonant from theirs, but ſhould it prevail to be the Religion of the <hi>Legiſlators</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> of Nations, thoſe Springs of Wealth would be immediately dried up, by which their Superior <hi>Clergy,</hi> and all their Religious <hi>Orders</hi> are enriched and fed up in Idleneſs. And ſhould the People come to be generally imbued with Principles of Goſpel, Light and Liberty, they would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſhake off a blind and ſlaviſh Dependence upon <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſubvert the Foundation upon which the <hi>Monarchick</hi> Grandeur of the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi>
               <pb n="382" facs="tcp:48501:202"/>and their whole <hi>Religion</hi> is ſuperſtructed, and deſtroy the Engine by which they are inabled to Lord it over the Bodies, Eſtates, and Conſciences of Men. And if <hi>Proteſtants</hi> every where, eſpecially under <hi>Popiſh</hi> Rulers, were not under a ſtrange Infatuation, they would look for no fairer Quarter from <hi>Papiſts,</hi> than what their Brethren have met with in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Piedmont,</hi> nor would they rely upon the Faith of any <hi>King,</hi> that ſtiles himſelf a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> ſeeing Sacred Promiſes, tremendous Oaths, and the moſt Authentick Declarations, are but <hi>Papal</hi> Arts, and Tricks ſanctified at <hi>Rome,</hi> whereby to lull Subjects into a Security, and delude them into a neglect of all means, for preſerving themſelves, and their Religion, till their Rulers can be in a condition, of obeying the <hi>Decrees</hi> of the <hi>fourth Lateran Council,</hi> that enjoyns <hi>Kings to deſtroy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate Hereticks, under pain of Excommunication, and of having both their Subjects abſolved from Allegiance to them, and their Territories given away to others;</hi> and till without running any Hazard, they may comply with the <hi>Ordinance</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> which not only <hi>releaſeth</hi> them from all <hi>Obligation of keeping Faith to Hereticks, but requires them to violate it;</hi> and accordingly made <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> break his <hi>Faith</hi> to <hi>John Hus,</hi> whom in defiance of the Security given him by that <hi>King,</hi> they cauſed to be condemned and Burn'd. Nor is the Practice and late Example of the <hi>Great Louis,</hi> deſigned for leſs than a Pattern, by which all <hi>Popiſh Princes</hi> are to act, and his Proceedings are to be the Copy and Moddel, which they who would merit the name of Zealous <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and be eſteemed dutiful <hi>Sons</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> are to tranſcribe and limn out in Lines of Force, Violence and Blood, and for the better correſponding with the <hi>Original,</hi> to imploy <hi>Dragoons</hi> for <hi>Miſſionaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And tho I will not ſay, but that there may be ſome <hi>Popiſh Princes,</hi> who through an extraordinary Meaſure of good Nature, and from Principles of Compaſſion, woven into their Conſtitution, previouſly to all notices of Revelation, whether real or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and who through Sentiments imbib'd from a generous Education, and their coming afterwards to be under the Influence and Management of wiſe and diſcreet Counſellors, may be able to reſiſt the malignant Impreſſions of their Religion, and ſo be preſerved from the Inhumanities towards thoſe of different Perſwaſions from them in the things of God, which their Prieſts would lay them under Obligations unto, by the Doctrines of the <hi>Romiſh Faith;</hi> yet there appears no reaſon why an underſtanding Man ſhould be induced to believe, that the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is likely to prove a Prince of that great and noble Temper, there being more than enough, both to raiſe a Jealouſie and beget a Perſwaſion, that there is not a <hi>Monarch</hi> among all thoſe who are commonly ſtiled <hi>Catholicks,</hi> from whom <hi>Proteſtants</hi> may juſtly dread greater Severities than from <hi>Him,</hi> or look for worſe and more Barbarous Treatments. I am not ignorant, with what Candor we ought, by the Rules of Charity and good Manners, to ſpeak of all Men, whatſoever their Religion is, nor am I unacquainted with what Veneration and Deference we are to diſcourſe of Crowned Heads; but as I dare not give thoſe flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Titles unto any, of which there are not a few in ſome of the late <hi>Addreſſes,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the <hi>King,</hi> by an inconſiderable and fooliſh ſort of <hi>Diſſenting</hi> Preachers; ſo I ſhould not know how to be accountable to God, my own Conſcience, or the World, ſhould I not in my Station, as a Proteſtant, and as a Lover of the Laws and Liberties of my Country, offer ſomething, whereby both to undeceive that weak and ſhort-ſighted People, whom their own being accommodated for a Seaſon by the <hi>Declaration</hi> of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,</hi> hath deluded into an Opinion, that His Majeſty cheriſheth no thoughts of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting our <hi>Religion,</hi> and alſo further to enlighten and confirm others, in the juſt Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions they are poſſeſſed with, of the Deſign carrying on in <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> for the Extirpation of <hi>Proteſtancy,</hi> and that the late <hi>Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> is emitted in Subſerviency thereunto, and calculated by the <hi>Court,</hi> toward the paving and preparing the way, for the more facile Accompliſhment of it. And while <hi>Mercenary Sycophants,</hi> by their Flatteries infect and corrupt Princes, and by their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting them to the World, in Colours diſagreeable from their Tempers and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, and in milder and fairer Characters, than any thing obſervable in them, either deſerveth, or correſpondeth with, do delude Subjects into ſuch Opinions of them, as beget a neglect of Means for preſerving themſelves; 'tis become a neceſſary Duty, and an indiſpenſible Service to Mankind, to deal plainly and above-board, that ſo by deſcribing <hi>Kings</hi> as they are, and ſetting them in a true and juſt Light, we may prevent the Peoples being further impoſed upon; or if through ſuffering themſelves to be ſtill deceived, they come to fall under Miſeries and Perſecutions, they may lay all their Diſtreſſes and Deſolations at the Door of their own Folly, in not having taken care, how to avoid what they were not only threatned with, but whereof they were warned and advertiſed.
<note place="margin">Hiſtory of the Times.</note> For as I am not of Sir <hi>Roger l'Eſtrange</hi>'s mind, <hi>That if we cannot avoid being diſtruſtful of our Safety, yet it is extremely Vain,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:48501:202"/>fooliſh, and extravagant to talk of it;</hi> ſo I am very ſenſible how many of the <hi>French Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> by painting forth their <hi>King</hi> more like a God than a Man, and by poſſeſſing their People with a belief of Wiſdom, Juſtice, Grace, and Mercy in <hi>Him,</hi> of which they knew him deſtitute, they both emboldned <hi>Him,</hi> to attempt what he hath perpetrated, and laid them under Snares, which they knew not how to diſentangle themſelves from, in order to eſcape it. Nor would the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> have acted with that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of the future Safety of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> nor have expoſed them to the Reſentment, and hereafter Revenge of three Nations, by the Arbitrary and Illegal Steps he hath made in their Favor, if he intended any thing leſs, than the putting <hi>Proteſtants</hi> for ever out of Capacity and Condition, of calling them to a Reckoning, and exacting an Account of them, which neither <hi>He,</hi> nor they about him, can have the weakneſs to think they have ſufficiently provided againſt, without compelling us by an <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>à la mode France Miſſionaries</hi> to turn <hi>Catholicks,</hi> or by adjudging us to <hi>Mines</hi> and <hi>Galleys,</hi> according to the <hi>Verſailles</hi> Preſident, for our Heretical Stubbornneſs, or which is the more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious way of <hi>Converting three Kingdoms,</hi> to cauſe <hi>Murther</hi> the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Inhabitants, according to the Pattern, which his Loyal <hi>Iriſh Catholicks,</hi> endeavored to have ſet <hi>anno</hi> 1641. for the <hi>Converſion</hi> of that <hi>Nation.</hi> Had his <hi>Majeſty</hi> been contented with the bare avowing, and publiſhing himſelf to be of the Communion of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and of challenging a Liberty, though againſt Law, for the Exerciſe of his <hi>Religion,</hi> it might have awakened our Pity and Compaſſion, to ſee <hi>him</hi> embrace a <hi>Religion,</hi> where there are ſo many Impediments of Salvation, and in doing whereof, he was become obnoxious unto the Imprecation of his <hi>Grandfather, who wiſhed the Curſe of God, to fall upon ſuch of his Poſterity, as ſhould at any time turn Papiſts;</hi> but it would have raiſed no intemperate Heats in the Minds of any againſt him, much leſs have alienated them, from the Subjection and Obedience, which are due unto their <hi>Sovereign,</hi> by the Laws of the ſeveral <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> and the Fundamental Rules of the reſpective Conſtitutions. Or could <hi>He</hi> have been contented with waving the rigorous Execution of the Laws againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> of whatſoever Quality, Rank, or Order they were, and with the beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſonal and private Favors upon thoſe of his <hi>Religion;</hi> it would have been ſo far from begetting Rancor or Diſcontent in his <hi>Proteſtant Subjects,</hi> that they would not only have connived at, and approved ſuch a Procedure, and thoſe little Benignities and Kindneſſes, but had the <hi>Papiſts</hi> quietly acquieſced in them, and modeſtly improved them, it might have been a means of reconciling the <hi>Nation</hi> to more Lenity towards them for the future, and might have influenced our <hi>Legiſlators,</hi> when God ſhall vouchſafe us a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> on the <hi>Throne,</hi> to moderate the Severities to which by the <hi>Laws</hi> in being they are obnoxious, and to render their Condition as eaſie and ſafe, as that of other Subjects, and only to take care, for precluding them ſuch Places of Power and Truſt, as ſhould prevent their being able to hurt us, but could bring no damage or inconvenience upon themſelves. But the <hi>King</hi> inſtead of terminating here, and allowing only ſuch Graces and Immunities to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as would have been enough, for the placing them in the private Exerciſe of their <hi>Religion,</hi> with Security to them, and without any threatning Danger to us. <hi>He</hi> hath not only ſuſpended all the <hi>penal Laws</hi> againſt <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> but <hi>He</hi> hath by an uſurped <hi>Prerogative,</hi> that is para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to the <hi>Rules</hi> of the <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> and to all <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> diſpenſed with, and diſabled the <hi>Laws</hi> that enjoin the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and which appoint and preſcribe the <hi>Teſts,</hi> that were the Fences, which the Wiſdom of the Nation had erected, for preſerving the <hi>Legiſlative Authority,</hi> ſecuring the <hi>Government,</hi> and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Places of Power, Magiſtracy and Office, in the hands of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and thereby of continuing the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh Liberties,</hi> to our ſelves, and the Generations that ſhall come after us. And as if this were not ſufficient, to awaken us to a Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the danger we are in, of having our <hi>Religion</hi> ſupplanted and overthrown; <hi>He</hi> hath not only advanced the moſt <hi>violent Papiſts,</hi> unto all Places of <hi>Military</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand by Sea and Land; but hath eſtabliſh'd many of them, in the chief Truſts and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Magiſtracy,</hi> and <hi>Civil Judicature,</hi> ſo that there are ſcarce any continued in Power and Employment, ſave they who have either promiſed to turn <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> or who have engaged to concur and aſſiſt to the Subverting our <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Mask and Diſguiſe of <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> 'Tis already evident, that it is beyond the help and relief of all Peaceable and Civil means, to preſerve and uphold the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that nothing but Force and an inteſtine War, can retrieve it unto, and re-eſtabliſh it there, in any degree of Safety. Nor is it leſs apparent, from the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and Tyrannous <hi>Oath,</hi> ordained to be required of His <hi>Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> whereby they are to ſwear <hi>Obedience to Him without Reſerve,</hi> that our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> is held only precariouſly in that <hi>Kingdom;</hi> and that whenſoever <hi>He</hi> ſhall pleaſe to command the Eſtabliſhment of <hi>Popery,</hi> and to enjoin the People to enter into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:48501:203"/>of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> he expects to have his Will immediately conformed unto, and not to be diſputed or controlled. But leſt what we are to expect from the <hi>King,</hi> as to the Extirpation of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> and the inflicting the utmoſt Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities upon his <hi>Proteſtant Subjects,</hi> that Papal Rage, armed with Power, can inable him unto, may not ſo fully appear, from what hath been already intimated, as either to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> out of the <hi>Lethargy,</hi> into which the late <hi>Declaration</hi> hath caſt them, or to quicken thoſe of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> to that zealous care, vigilancy, and uſe of all Lawful means, for preſerving themſelves, and the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Danger, wherewith they are threatned, requires at their hands; I ſhall give that farther Confirmation of it, from <hi>Topicks</hi> and Motives of Credibility, <hi>Moral, Political,</hi> and <hi>Hiſtorical,</hi> as may ſerve to place it in the brighteſt Light, and fulleſt Evidence, that a matter future and yet to come, which is only the object of our proſpect and dread, and not of our feeling and experience, is capable of.</p>
            <p>It ought to be of weight upon the minds of all <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants,</hi> that the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> is not only an open and avow'd <hi>Papiſt,</hi> but as moſt <hi>Apoſtates</hi> uſe to be, a fiery <hi>Bigot</hi> in the <hi>Romiſh Religion,</hi> and who, as the <hi>Leige Letter</hi> from a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> to a <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of the <hi>Order,</hi> tells us, is <hi>reſolved either to Convert</hi> England <hi>to Popery, or to dye a Martyr.</hi> Nor were the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Zealots, of whoſe rageful Tranſports, <hi>Joſephus</hi> gives us ſo ample an Account, nor the <hi>Derviſes</hi> among the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> of whoſe mad Attempts, ſo many Hiſtories make mention, more brutal in their Fanatical Heats, than a <hi>Popiſh Bigot</hi> uſeth to be, when favored with Advantages, of exerting his Animoſity againſt thoſe who differ from him, if he be not carefully watched againſt, and reſtrained. Beſide the innumerable Inſtances of the Tragical Effects of <hi>Romiſh Bigottry,</hi> that are to be met with in Books of all kinds, we need go no farther for an Evidence of it, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the Life of <hi>Dominick,</hi> the great Inſtigator and Promoter of the Maſſacre of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and the Founder of that <hi>Order,</hi> which hath the Management of the Bloody <hi>Inquiſition;</hi> together with the Life of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third of <hi>France,</hi> who contrary to the Advice of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and the repeated Intreaties of the wiſeſt of his own Counſellors, the <hi>Chancellor de l' Hoſpital,</hi> and the <hi>Preſident de Thou,</hi> not only revived the War and Perſecution againſt his <hi>Reformed Subjects,</hi> after he had ſeen what Judgments, the like Proceedings had derived upon his Predeceſſors, and how prejudicial they had proved to the Strength, Glory, and Intereſt of his <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Kingdom,</hi> but he entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>League</hi> with thoſe that fought to depreſs, abdicate, and depoſe him, and became the Head of a Faction for the deſtroying that part of his Subjects, upon whom alone he could rely for the defence of his Perſon, and ſupport of his Dignity. Nor were the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Duke <hi>de Alva</hi> heretofore, or the preſent Barbarities of <hi>Louis</hi> the <hi>Fourteenth,</hi> ſo much the Effects of their haughty and furious Tempers, as of their <hi>Bigottry</hi> in their inhuman and ſanguinary Religion. That the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is ſecond to none, in a blind and rageful Popiſh Zeal, his Behaviour, both while a Subject, and ſince he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the <hi>Crown,</hi> doth not only place it beyond the limits of a bare Suſpition, but affords us ſuch Evidences of it, as that none in conſiſtency with Principles of Wiſdom, and Diſcretion, can either queſtion or contradict it. To what elſe can we aſcribe it, but to an exceſſive <hi>Bigottry?</hi> That when the <hi>Frigot,</hi> wherein he was Sailing to <hi>Scotland anno</hi> 1682. ſtruck upon the Sands, and was ready to ſink, he ſhould prefer the Lives of one or two pitiful <hi>Prieſts,</hi> to thoſe of Men of the greateſt <hi>Quality,</hi> and receive thoſe Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roons into the Boat, in which himſelf eſcaped, while at the ſame time, he refuſed to admit, not only his own <hi>Brother-in-Law,</hi> but divers Noblemen of the Supremeſt Rank and Character, to the benefit of the ſame means of Deliverance, and ſuffered them to periſh, though they had undertaken that Voyage out of pure reſpect to his Perſon, and to put an Honor upon him, at a Seaſon, when he wanted not Enemies. Nor can it proceed from any thing but a violent and furious <hi>Bigottry,</hi> that he ſhould not only diſoblige and diſguſt the two <hi>Univerſities,</hi> of whoſe Zeal to his Service, <hi>he</hi> hath receiv'd ſo many ſeaſonable and effectual Teſtimonies, but to the Violation both of the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> offer force to their Conſciences, as well as to their Rights and Franchiſes, and all this in favor of <hi>Father Francis,</hi> whom he would illegally thruſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and of Mr. <hi>Farmer,</hi> whom he would arbitrarily obtrude in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Headſhip</hi> of a <hi>College</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> who as they are too deſpicable to be owned, and ſtood for, in Competition againſt two famous <hi>Univerſities,</hi> whoſe greateſt Crime, hath been, an Exceſs of Zeal for his Perſon and Intereſt, when he was <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> and a meaſure of Loyalty and Obedience unto him, ſince <hi>he</hi> came to the <hi>Crown,</hi> beyond what either the Rules of Chriſtianity, or the Laws of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> exact from them; ſo he hath ways enough of expreſſing Kindneſs and Bounty, to thoſe two little contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible Creatures, and that in Methods as beneficial to them, as the Places into which <hi>he</hi> would thruſt them, can be ſuppoſed to amount unto, and I am ſure with leſs Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:48501:203"/>to himſelf, and leſs Offence to all <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as well as without offering Injury to the Rights of the <hi>Univerſity,</hi> or of compelling thoſe learned, grave and venerable Men to perjure themſelves, and act againſt their Duties and Conſciences. The late Proceedings towards Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> are not only contrary to all the Meaſures of Juſtice, Law and Honor, but argue a ſtrange and furious <hi>Bigottry</hi> in <hi>His Majeſty</hi> for Popery, there being nothing elſe into which a Man can reſolve the whole Tenor of his preſent Actings againſt Him, ſeeing ſetting aſide the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s being a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and his having vindicated the <hi>Reformation</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> from the Calumnies and Slanders wherewith it was aſperſed by <hi>Sanders,</hi> and others of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, and the approving himſelf in ſome other Writings, worthy of the Character of a <hi>Reformed Divine,</hi> and of that eſteem which the World entertains of him, for Knowledge in Hiſtory, and all other parts of good Learning; there hath nothing occurred in the whole Tenor and Trace of his Life, but what, inſtead of Rebuke and Cenſure, hath merited Acknowledgments, and the Retributions of Favor and Preferment from the <hi>Court.</hi> Whoſoever conſiders his conſtant Preaching up Paſſive Obedience to ſuch a Degree and Height, as he hath done, may very well be ſurpriſed at the whole Method of their preſent Actings towards him, and at the ſame time that they find cauſe to juſtifie the Righteouſneſs of God, in making them the Inſtruments of his Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whom in ſo many ways he had ſought to oblige, they may juſtly conclude that none, ſave a <hi>Bigotted Papiſt,</hi> could be the Author of ſo inſuitable, as well as illegal and unrighteous Returns. For as to all whereof he is accuſed, in the <hi>Criminal Letters</hi> againſt him, bearing date the 19th. of <hi>April</hi> 1687. I my ſelf am both able to aſſert his <hi>Innocence,</hi> and dare aſſure the World, that none of the Perſons whom he is charged to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with againſt the King, would have been ſo far void of Diſcretion, (knowing his Principles) as to have tranſacted with him in Matters of that kind; but whether his Letters ſince that, to the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Middletoune,</hi> with the <hi>Paper</hi> incloſed in one of them, have adminiſtred any <hi>Legal</hi> Ground for their <hi>Second Citation,</hi> I ſhall not take upon me to determine, and will only ſay, that as I heartily wiſh, he had not in thoſe <hi>Letters</hi> afforded them any probable Pretence for proceeding againſt him, ſo there are Exceſſes of Loyalty in them, to attone for the utmoſt Indiſcretions, his words are capable of being wreſted unto; nor can any thing but <hi>Papal Malice</hi> and <hi>Romiſh Chicanerie,</hi> conſtrue and pervert them, ſo far contrary to his Intentions, as to make Crimes, and much leſs to make Treaſons of them. Now as nothing can be of more portentous <hi>Omen</hi> to <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh Proteſtants,</hi> than to have a Popiſh <hi>Bigot</hi> exalted to Rule over them; ſo through a Concurrence of ill Nature, and a deficiency in Intellectuals, met in him with this furious Zeal and <hi>Bigottry,</hi> they are the more to expect, whatſoever his Power inables him to inflict, that is Severe and Dreadful. 'Tis poſſible that a Ruler may be poſſeſſed with a Fondneſs and Valuation of Popery, as the only Religion wherein Salvation is to be obtained, and therefore in his private Judgment and Opinion, ſentence all to eternal Flames, who cannot herd with him in the ſame Society; and yet he may, through a great meaſure of Humanity, and from an extraordinary Proportion of Compaſſion and Meekneſs, woven into his Nature, hate the imbrueing his Hands in their Blood, or treating thoſe with any Harſhneſs, whoſe ſuppoſed Misbelief is their only Crime; and that finding them in all other Reſpects, Vertuous, Peaceable and Induſtrious, He may leave them to the decretive Sentence of the Sovereign and infallible Judge, without diſturbing or meddling with them himſelf. Nor is it impoſſible, but that there may be a Prince ſo far <hi>Bigotted</hi> in Popery, as to have Inclination and Propenſity to force all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Authority, to be of his Religion, or elſe to deſtroy and extirpate them, yet through being of that largeneſs of Underſtanding and Political Wiſdom, as to be able to penetrate into the Hazards of attempting it, and to foreſee the Conſequences that may enſue upon it, in reference to the Peace and Safety of his Government, as well as the Wealth and Power of his Dominions, he may come to check and ſtifle his furious Inclinations, and chuſe rather to leave his Subjects at quiet, than to impoveriſh, weaken and diſ-people his Country, either by deſtroying them, or by driving them to abandon his Territories, in order to find a Shelter and Sanctuary in other places. But where (as in the King of <hi>England</hi>) a ſmall Meaſure of Underſtanding, accompanied with a large ſhare of a Moroſe, Fierce and Ill Nature, and theſe attended with Inſolency and Pride, as they uſually are in weak and froward People, come to have a <hi>Bigottry</hi> in ſuch a Religion as Popery, ſuperadded to them, whoſe Doctrines and Principles inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and oblige to Cruelty, towards all of other Perſwaſions, there Proteſtants do find nothing that may incourage to hope for Security and Protection under a Prince of that Temper and Complexion; but all that does affect and impreſs their Minds, bids them prepare for Perſecution, and to look for the utmoſt Rigors and Severities that Pride, Malice, brutal Zeal, back'd and ſupported with Force and Power, can execute and inflict.
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:48501:204"/>And how much ſuch a Prince's Religion proves too weak to reſtrain him from Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſes, and other Immoralities, by ſo much the more is <hi>he</hi> to be dreaded, in that he thinks to compound for, and expiate Crimes of that Nature, by his Cruelty to <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and <hi>his</hi> offering them up in Sacrifices of Attonement to the <hi>Tripple Crown.</hi> Nor are the Prieſts either diſpleaſed with, or careful to diſſwade Princes from Offences of that kind, though they know them to be great Provocations to God, and of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Example to Subjects, ſeeing they are Maſters of the Art of improving them, to the Service of <hi>Holy Church,</hi> and the Advantage of the <hi>Catholick Faith.</hi> For inſtead of impoſing upon thoſe <hi>Royal</hi> Tranſgreſſors, the little and Slaviſh <hi>Penances</hi> of Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages, Whippings, and going Bare-foot; they require them to make Satisfactions for thoſe and the like Crimes, by the pious and meritorious Acts of Murthering <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and of extirpating the <hi>Northern Hereſie.</hi> And as one of the <hi>French</hi> Whores of State is reported to have been a Perſon that hath principally inſtigated to all the Cruelties againſt the <hi>Reformed</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> ſo no doubt but as ſhe did it under the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Conduct of her <hi>Confeſſors,</hi> to compenſate for her Adulteries, ſo ſhe adviſed and perſwaded <hi>Louis</hi> to it upon Motives of the ſame nature. Nor do they who have the guidance of Conſciences at <hi>White-hall</hi> want matter of the ſame kind to improve and work upon; and as there are of the licentious <hi>Females,</hi> that will be glad of <hi>attoning</hi> for their filthy Pollutions, by Acts ſo agreeable to the <hi>Articles</hi> of their <hi>Religion;</hi> ſo there are ſome, who as they have Influence enough upon the King, to Counſel <hi>Him</hi> to the like Methods, ſo they will find <hi>Him</hi> ſufficiently diſpoſed to compound for his Loathſom and Promiſcuous Scatterings, at a rate ſo ſuitable to his Temper, as well as to the Doctrines of the <hi>Papal Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any be deluded into a good Opinion of <hi>His Majeſty,</hi> and brought to flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Expectations of their being protected in the Profeſſion of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, they may be eaſily undeceived and prevailed upon to change their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if they will but conſider his Behaviour towards <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the <hi>Poſt</hi> wherein he formerly ſtood, and what his carriage was to them, while he was fixed in a meaner and more ſubordinate Station than now he is. Though there have been many whoſe Behaviour in their private Condition, would have rendred them thought worthy to Rule, if their Actions, after their Advancement to governing Power, had not confuted the Opinion entertained concerning them; yet here have been very few that have approved themſelves Juſt and Merciful after their attaining to Sovereignty, whoſe Carriage in an inferior Station, had been to the Damage and general Hurt of Mankind, as far as their narrow Power and Intereſt would extend. It ought therefore to lay us under a Conviction, what we are to expect from <hi>His Majeſty</hi> on the <hi>Throne,</hi> when we find the whole Thread and Series of his Conduct while a Subject, to have been a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued <hi>Deſign</hi> againſt our <hi>Religion,</hi> and an uninterrupted <hi>Plot</hi> for the Subverſion of our Laws and Liberties. 'Tis ſufficiently known, how active he always was, to keep up and inflame the Differences among <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and how he was both a great Promoter of all the ſevere <hi>Laws</hi> made againſt <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and a continual Inſtigator to the rigorous Execution of them: So that his affirming <hi>it to have been ever his Judgment, that none ought to be oppreſſed and perſecuted for Matters of Religion,</hi> nor to be hindered in Worſhipping <hi>God</hi> according to their ſeveral Perſwaſions; ſerves only to inform us, either with what little Honeſty, Honor and Conſcience <hi>He</hi> acted, in concurring to the making of the foreſaid <hi>Laws,</hi> or what ſmall Faith and Credit is now to be given to his <hi>Declaration,</hi> and to what he hath, ſince the Emiſſion of it, repeated both in his <hi>Speech</hi> to Mr. <hi>Penn,</hi> and in his <hi>Letter</hi> to Mr. <hi>Alſop.</hi> And to omit many other Inſtances of his kindneſs and Benignity to the <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> whom he now ſo much hugs and careſſeth; it may not be amiſs to remember <hi>them,</hi> and all other <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> of that barbarous and illegal <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> iſſued forth by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> while <hi>he,</hi> as the late King's <hi>High Commiſſioner,</hi> had the Management of the Affairs of that Kingdom; by which every <hi>Military Officer</hi> that had command over twelve Men, was impower'd to <hi>impannel</hi> Juries, Try, Condemn and cauſe to be put to Death, not only thoſe who ſhould be found to diſclaim the King's Authority, but ſuch as ſhould refuſe to acknowledge the King's new modelled <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi> over that <hi>Church;</hi> in the purſuance and Execution of which <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> ſome were Shot to Death, others were Hang'd or Drowned, and this not only during the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the Reign of his late <hi>Majeſty,</hi> but for above a Year and a half after the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>King</hi> came to the Crown. But what need is there, of inſiſting upon ſuch little Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, wherein he was at all times ready to expreſs his Malice to <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> ſeeing we have not only Dr. <hi>Oates</hi>'s Teſtimony, and that of divers others, but moſt Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Proofs from Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s <hi>Letters,</hi> of his having been in a Conſpiracy ſeveral Years for the Subverſion of our <hi>Religion,</hi> upon the meritorious and ſanctified Motive of extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating the <hi>Northern Hereſie.</hi> Of which, beſide all the Evidence that <hi>four</hi> Succeſſive
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:48501:204"/>
               <hi>Parliaments</hi> arrived at, I know ſeveral, who, ſince the Duke of <hi>York</hi> aſcended the Throne, have had it confirmed unto them by divers Foreign Papiſts, that were leſs reſerved, or more ingenuous than many of that Communion uſe to be. To queſtion the Exiſtence of that Plot, and his preſent <hi>Majeſties</hi> having been Acceſſary unto, and in the Head of it, argues a ſtrange <hi>Effrontery</hi> and Impudence, through caſting an Aſperſion of Weakneſs, Folly and Injuſtice, not only upon thoſe <hi>Three Parliaments</hi> that ſeem'd to have retained ſome <hi>Zeal</hi> for Engliſh Liberties, but by faſtening the ſame Imputations upon the <hi>Long Parliament,</hi> which had ſhewed it ſelf at all times more Obſequious to the Will of the Court, than was either for their own Honor, or the Safety and Intereſt of the Kingdom, and who had expreſſed a Veneration for the <hi>Royal Family,</hi> that approached too much upon a degree of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Whoſoever conſiders that Train of Counſels where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the King was many Years engaged, and whereof we felt the woful Effects in the <hi>Burning</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> the frequent <hi>Prorogation</hi> and <hi>Diſſolution</hi> of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> the <hi>widening</hi> and <hi>exaſperating Differences</hi> among <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> the <hi>ſtirring</hi> up and <hi>provoking Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Courts,</hi> to perſecute <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and the <hi>maintaining Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies</hi> with the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Catholick Princes</hi> abroad, to the diſhonor of the Nation, and danger of our Laws and Religion, cannot avoid being apprehenſive what we are now to look for at his Hands, nor can be eſcape, thinking that he eſteems his Advancement to the Crown, both a Reward from Heaven for what <hi>he</hi> hath done and plotted againſt theſe three Kingdoms, and an Opportunity and Advantage adminiſtred to <hi>him</hi> for the Perfecting and Accompliſhment of all thoſe Deſigns with which <hi>he</hi> hath been ſo long Bigg and in Travel for the Deſtruction of our Religion, the Subverſion of our Laws, and the Re-eſtabliſhment of Popery in theſe Dominions.</p>
            <p>The Conduct and Guidance under which <hi>His Majeſty</hi> hath put himſelf, and the fiery Temper of that <hi>Order</hi> to whoſe Government he hath reſigned his Conſcience, may great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly add to our Fears, and give us all the Jealouſie and Dread that we are capable of being impreſſed with, in reference to Matters to come, that there is nothing which can be Fatal to our Religion or Perſons, that we may not expect the being called to conflict with and ſuffer. For tho moſt of the Popiſh <hi>Eccleſiaſticks,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Regulars,</hi> bear an inveterate Malice to Proteſtants, and hold themſelves under indiſpenſible Obligations of eradicating whatſoever their <hi>Church</hi> ſtiles <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and have accordingly been always forward to ſtir up and provoke Rulers, to the uſe and Application of Force for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Proteſtants, as a Company of perverſe and obſtinate <hi>Hereticks,</hi> adjudged and condemned to the <hi>Stake</hi> and <hi>Gibbet</hi> by the infallible <hi>Chair;</hi> yet of all Men in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> and of their <hi>Religious Orders,</hi> the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are they who do moſt hate us, and whoſe Counſels have been moſt Sanguinary, and always tending to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence thoſe <hi>Monarchs,</hi> whoſe Conſciences they have had the guiding and conducting of, to the utmoſt Cruelties and Barbarities towards us. What our Brethren have had meaſured out to them in <hi>France,</hi> through <hi>Father de la Chaiſe</hi>'s Influence upon that <hi>King,</hi> and through the bewitching Power and Domination he hath over him in the quality of his <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> and as having the Direction of his Conſcience, may very well alarm and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us what we ought to expect from His <hi>Majeſty</hi> of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> who hath ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his Conſcience to the Guidance of <hi>Father Peters,</hi> a Perſon of the ſame <hi>Order,</hi> and of the like miſchievous and bloody Diſpoſition that the former is. 'Tis well obſerved by the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Reaſons againſt Repealing the Acts of Parliament concerning the Teſt,</hi> that <hi>Cardinal Howard</hi>'s being of ſuch a meek and gentle Temper, that is able to withſtand the Malignity of his Religion, and to preſerve him from concurring in thoſe miſchievous Counſels which his Purple might ſeem to oblige him unto, is the reaſon of his being ſhut out from Acquaintance with, and Intereſt in the <hi>Engliſh Affairs</hi> tranſacted at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that whatſoever his <hi>Majeſty</hi> hath to do in that <hi>Court,</hi> is managed by <hi>his Ambaſſador</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſole <hi>Direction</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuits.</hi> So that it is not without cauſe, that the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> of <hi>Liege,</hi> in his intercepted and lately printed <hi>Letter,</hi> tells a <hi>Brother</hi> of the <hi>Order,</hi> what a wonderful Veneration the <hi>King</hi> hath for the <hi>Society,</hi> and with what profound <hi>Submiſſion</hi> he receives thoſe <hi>Reverend Fathers,</hi> and hearkens to whatſoever they repreſent. Nor is His <hi>Majeſty's</hi> being under the Influence of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> through having one of them for his <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> and ſeveral of them for his <hi>Chief Counſellors</hi> and <hi>principal Confidents,</hi> the only thing, in this Matter, that awakens our Fear in what we are to expect from his armed Power, excited and ſtir'd up by that fiery <hi>Tribe,</hi> but there is another <hi>Ground</hi> why we ought more eſpecially to dread him, and that is, <hi>his</hi> being entred and enrolled into the <hi>Order,</hi> and become a <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Society,</hi> whereby he is brought into a greater <hi>Subjection</hi> and <hi>Dependence</hi> upon them, and ſtands bound by <hi>Ties</hi> and <hi>Engagements</hi> of being obedient to the <hi>Commands</hi> of the <hi>General</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and that not only in <hi>Spirituals,</hi> but in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they ſhall pretend to be ſubſervient to the <hi>Exaltation</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Tripple Crown.</hi> This is a Myſtery which few are yet acquainted
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:48501:205"/>with, and which both His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and the <hi>Order,</hi> judge it their Intereſt to have induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly concealed, but whereof the World may ere long receive that convictive Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that there will be no room left for ſuſpecting the Truth of it, and whereof a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> in the late printed <hi>Letter</hi> from <hi>Liege,</hi> hath given us already ſufficient Intimation, both in telling us, <hi>That the King of</hi> England <hi>ſtiles himſelf a Son of the Society;</hi> and how that he wrote to <hi>Father de la Chaiſe, that he would account every Injury done to the Jeſuits, to be a wrong committed againſt himſelf.</hi> Neither is it ſo ſurpriſing as it may ſeem at firſt view that the <hi>King</hi> ſhould liſt himſelf a <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Order,</hi> ſeeing there have been <hi>four</hi> other <hi>Crowned Heads,</hi> of whoſe Entrance and Matriculation into the <hi>Society,</hi> there is all the Evidence and Aſſurance imaginable. And tho <hi>one</hi> of them is acknowledged to have been in the <hi>Claſſis</hi> of the <hi>Directors,</hi> while the other <hi>three</hi> are generally believed to have been in the <hi>Form</hi> of the <hi>Directed;</hi> yet ſuch was the Power of the <hi>Society</hi> over them all, that a great part of the Cruelty exerciſed towards <hi>Proteſtants</hi> both in the laſt Age and in this, is to be aſcribed to that implicit and blind <hi>Obedience,</hi> which they were bound to yield to the <hi>Injunctions</hi> of the <hi>Order</hi> and to the <hi>Commands</hi> of the <hi>General. Philip the Second</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> who was the firſt <hi>King</hi> that entred into the <hi>Order,</hi> and who did it upon Motives of Policy in hopes, by their means, to have compaſſed the <hi>Univerſal Monarchy</hi> which he was aſpiring after, and who, through being in the <hi>Claſſis</hi> of <hi>Directors,</hi> had Advantages of uſing and improving, and not of being in that degree of Servitude unto them which the others have been; yet to what <hi>barbarous Cruelties</hi> did they over-rule and inſtigate him, not only to the Deſtruction of unconceivable Numbers of his Subjects, whoſe only Crime was, that they could not believe as the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth, which iſſued in the depopulating ſome of his Dominions, and his being depoſed from the Sovereignty in others; but to the Sacrificing his <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Heir Prince Charles,</hi> whom to gratifie the <hi>Society,</hi> he cauſed, upon an Accuſation of his favoring the <hi>Low-Country Hereticks,</hi> and the being himſelf tainted with <hi>Lutheraniſm,</hi> to be murthered in his own Court and Palace. <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who was the ſecond <hi>Crowned Head</hi> admitted into the <hi>Order,</hi> through complying with the Counſels, and ſerving the Wrath, Rage and Paſſions of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> in endeavoring to ſuppreſs <hi>Religion</hi> in <hi>Swedeland,</hi> to which he was <hi>Heir,</hi> and in ſtriving to ſubvert their <hi>Civil Rights,</hi> drew upon himſelf the Reſentment and Wrath of that Nation to ſuch a degree, that they <hi>abdicated him</hi> and his <hi>Heirs</hi> from the <hi>Government,</hi> and advanced ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Throne. <hi>Caſimire,</hi> who was alſo King of <hi>Poland,</hi> is reckoned to be the <hi>third Sovereign Prince</hi> that entered into the <hi>Society,</hi> and he, through coming under the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and being bound to follow their Directions, and to execute what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the <hi>General</hi> of the <hi>Order</hi> thought fit to enjoyn for the Promotion and Benefit of the <hi>Church,</hi> became not only an Inſtrument of a ſevere Perſecution againſt all ſort of <hi>Diſſenters</hi> from the <hi>Romiſh Faith,</hi> ſo that many were put to Death, and more driven to abandon their Country, but through committing many things in the courſe of his Government, that were prejudicial to the Rights, and thereupon diſguſtful to the Poliſh Nobility, they conceived ſuch an Averſion and Hatred for him, that to avoid the Effects of their Reſentment and Indignation, he was forced to lay down his Crown, and to chuſe to end his days in <hi>France,</hi> in no higher a Poſt, and under no more glorious a <hi>Character,</hi> than that of <hi>Abbot</hi> of <hi>St. German.</hi> There is a <hi>fourth Prince,</hi> and who is yet in being, that is generally believed to be enrolled into the <hi>Order,</hi> and the Perſecution he hath carried on in <hi>Hungary,</hi> contrary to his natural Temper, and to all the Rules of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Policy, and to the Violation of his Promiſes and Oaths for continuing unto them the Liberty of their Religion, is both too probable an Evidence of it, and a ſtrong Confirmation of the Cruelties which the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> inſtigate <hi>Princes</hi> unto, over whom they have Influence, and whom they have wheedled into Engagements of obeying their Commands, and purſuing their Injunctions. And as the deſolating of <hi>Hungary,</hi> through a long and bloody War, and the tempting the <hi>Turks</hi> to invade the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Territories, are ſome of the Effects that have enſued upon the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s complying with the fierce and heady Counſels of the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> ſo we have not ſeen all the Miſchiefs that the Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which they have engaged him in againſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> is like to iſſue in, tho beſide the diſguſting ſeveral <hi>Electoral</hi> Princes and States in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the furniſhing the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Potentate with Encouragements of continuing the War, there are wonderful Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages afforded by it, to embolden the <hi>French King</hi> in his Encroachments upon the Empire, which otherways he would not have dared to attempt, and whereof the reſult at laſt may prove fatal to the <hi>Imperial Dignity,</hi> and to the whole Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> Now what the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> ought to dread from the <hi>King,</hi> upon his being entred into a <hi>Society</hi> that hath breathed nothing but Fire and Blood ſince its firſt Inſtitution, I leave to the ſerious Conſideration of all Men who value their Lives, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Eſtates, and that do not think of renouncing their Religion, and turning Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. Nor is it to be imagined that the <hi>King,</hi> before he can be ſuppoſed well ſettled on
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:48501:205"/>the Throne, and while under a declining State of Body, as well as in an advanced Age, having the weight of <hi>Four and fifty</hi> upon his Shoulders, beſide ſomething elſe that he is obliged to the Earl of <hi>Southesk</hi> for, which I ſhall not mention, would have taken ſo many bold, wide, and Illegal Steps for the Supplanting our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> and for the Introduction and Eſtabliſhment of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Tyranny,</hi> and this not only to the loſing and diſobliging his former <hi>Votaries</hi> and <hi>Partizans,</hi> but to the ſtrange Allarming and Diſguſting moſt Perſons of Honor, Quality and Intereſt in the Three Kingdoms, were he not beſide the being under the Sway of his own <hi>Bigottry,</hi> and the ſtrong Ballance of a large Meaſure of ill Nature, bound by Ties of implicit Obedience to the Commands of that extravagant and furious Society, to the promoting of whoſe Paſſions and Malice, rather than his own Safety and Glory, or the laſting Benefit of the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> themſelves, the whole Courſe of his Government hitherto ſeems to have been ſhapen and adapted. The Occaſion and Subject of the late Conteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>him</hi> and the <hi>Pope,</hi> which hath made ſo great a Noiſe not only at <hi>Rome,</hi> but through all <hi>Europe,</hi> may ſerve to convince us both of the extraordinary Zeal <hi>he</hi> hath for the <hi>Society,</hi> and of the tranſcendent Power they have over him, and that 'tis no wonder <hi>he</hi> ſhould <hi>exact an Obedience without reſerve from his Subjects in</hi> Scotland, ſeeing <hi>he himſelf</hi> yields an Obedience without reſerve to the <hi>Jeſuits.</hi> 'Tis known, how that by the <hi>Rules</hi> of their <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> no <hi>Jeſuit</hi> is capable of the <hi>Mitre,</hi> and that if the Ambition of any of them, ſhould tempt him to ſeek or accept the Dignity of a <hi>Prelate,</hi> he muſt, for being capacitated thereunto, renounce his <hi>Memberſhip</hi> in the <hi>Order.</hi> Yet ſo great is His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties</hi> Paſſion for the Honor and Grandeur of the <hi>Society,</hi> and ſuch is their Domination and abſolute Power over him, that no leſs will ſerve him, neither would they allow him to inſiſt upon leſs, than that the Pope ſhould diſpenſe with <hi>Father Peters</hi> being made a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> without his ceaſing to be a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> or the being tranſplanted into another <hi>Order.</hi> And this the old <hi>Gentleman</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> hath been forced at laſt to comply with, and to grant a <hi>Diſpenſation,</hi> whereby <hi>Father Peters</hi> ſhall be capable of the <hi>Prelature,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his remaining in the <hi>Ignatian Order,</hi> the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> through their Authority over the King, not ſuffering him to recede from his Demand, and His <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Zeal for the Society, not permitting him to comply either with the Prayers, or the Conſcience and Honor of the Supreme Pontiff.</p>
            <p>Not only the King's Unthankfulneſs unto, but his illegal Proceedings againſt, and his Arbitrary invading the Rights of thoſe who ſtood by him in all his Dangers and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and who were the Inſtruments of preventing his Excluſion from the Crown, and the chief means both of his Advancement to the Throne, and his being kept in it, are ſo many new Evidences of the ill will he bears to all <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and what they are to dread from him, as Occaſions are Adminiſtred of Injuring and Oppreſſing them; and may ſerve to convince all impartial and thinking People, that his <hi>Popiſh Malice</hi> to our <hi>Religion,</hi> is too ſtrong for all Principles of <hi>Honor</hi> and <hi>Gratitude,</hi> and able to cancel the <hi>Obligations,</hi> which Friendſhip for his Perſon, and Service to his Intereſt, may be ſuppoſed to have laid him under to any heretofore. Had it not been for many of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> who ſtood up with a Zeal and Vigor for preſerving the Succeſſion in the right Line, beyond what Religion, Conſcience, Reaſon or Intereſt could conduct them unto, he had never been able to have out-wreſtled the Endeavors of <hi>Three Parliaments</hi> for ex-excluding him from the Imperial Crown of <hi>England:</hi> And had it not been for their Abetting and ſtanding by him with their Swords in their Hands, upon the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Deſcent into the Kingdom <hi>Anno</hi> 1685 he could not have avoided the being driven from the <hi>Throne,</hi> and the having the Scepter wreſted out of his Hand. Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever had the Advantage of knowing the Temper and Genius of the late King, and how afraid he was of embarking into any thing that might import a viſible Hazard to the Peace of his Government, and draw after it a general Diſguſt of his Perſon; will be ſoon ſatisfied, that if all his <hi>Proteſtant Subjects</hi> had united in their Deſires, and concurred in their Endeavors, to have had the Duke of <hi>York</hi> debarred from the Crown, that his <hi>late Majeſty</hi> would not have once ſcrupled the complying with it, and that his Love to his <hi>Dear Brother,</hi> would have given way to the Apprehenſion and Fear of forfeiting a Love for himſelf in the Hearts of his People, eſpecially when what was required of him, was not an Invaſion upon the Fundamentals of the Conſtitution of the <hi>Engliſh Monarchy,</hi> nor diſſonant from the Practice of the Nation in many repeated Inſtances. Nor can there be a greater Evidence of the preſent <hi>King</hi>'s ill Nature, Romiſh Bigottry, and prodigious Ingratitude, as well as of the Deſign he is carrying on againſt our <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> than his Carriage and Behavior towards the Church of <hi>England;</hi> tho I cannot but acknowledge it a righteous <hi>Judgment</hi> upon them from God, and a juſt Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for their being not only ſo unconcerned for the Preſervation of our Religion and Liberties, in avoiding to cloſe with the only Methods that were adapted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:48501:206"/>but for being ſo Paſſionate and Induſtrious to haſten the Loſs of them, through putting the Government into ones hands, who (as they might have foreſeen) would be ſure to make a Sacrifice of them to his beloved Popery, and to his inordinate Luſt after deſpotical and Arbitrary Power. And as the only Example bearing any Affinity to it, is that of <hi>Louis</hi> XIV. who in recompence to his <hi>Proteſtant Subjects</hi> for maintaining him on the Throne, when the late Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> aſſiſted by Papiſts, would have wreſted the Crown from him, hath treated them with a <hi>Barbarity,</hi> whereof that of <hi>Antiochus</hi> towards the Jews, and that of <hi>Diocletian</hi> and <hi>Maximian</hi> towards the Primitive Chriſtians were but ſcanty and imperfect Draughts; ſo there wants nothing for compleating the Parallel between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> but a little more time and a fortunate Opportunity, and then the deluded <hi>Church-men</hi> will find, that <hi>Father Peters</hi> is no leſs skillful at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> for transforming their Acts of Loyalty and Merit towards the <hi>King,</hi> into <hi>Crimes</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi> of their <hi>Ruin,</hi> than <hi>Pere de la Chaiſe</hi> hath ſhewn himſelf at <hi>Verſailles,</hi> where by an <hi>Art</hi> peculiar to the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> he hath improved the <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> of the <hi>Reformed</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> for the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> into a reaſon of alienating that <hi>Monarch</hi> from them, and into a ground of his deſtroying that dutiful and obedient People. It will not be amiſs to call over ſome of his <hi>Majeſty's Proceedings</hi> towards the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that from what hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſeen and felt, both they and all <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants</hi> may the better know what they are to expect and look for hereafter. Tho it be a <hi>Method</hi> very unbecoming a Prince, yet it ſhews a great deal of Spleen, to turn the former <hi>Perſecution</hi> of <hi>Diſſenters</hi> ſo maliciouſly upon the <hi>Prelatical</hi> and <hi>Conforming Clergy,</hi> as his <hi>Majeſty</hi> doth in his <hi>Letter</hi> to Mr. <hi>Alſop,</hi> in ſtiling them <hi>a Party of Proteſtants, who think the only way to advance their Church, is by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing thoſe Churches of Chriſtians that differ from them in ſmaller Matters.</hi> Whereas the Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> met with, had much of its Original at <hi>Court,</hi> where it was formed and deſigned upon Motives of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrarineſs;</hi> and the Reſentment and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful Humor of ſome of the old Prelates, and other Church-men that had ſuffered in the late times, was only laid hold of, the better to juſtifie and improve it. And tho it be too true, that many of the <hi>dignified Rank,</hi> as well as of the little <hi>Levites,</hi> were both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fond of it, and contentiouſly pleaded for it; yet it is as true, that moſt of them did it not upon Principles of Judgment and Conſcience, but upon Inducements of Reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation for conceived Injuries, and upon a belief of its being the moſt compendious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to the next Preferment and Benefice, and the faireſt way of ſtanding recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the Favor of the two <hi>Royal Brothers.</hi> Nor is it unworthy of Obſervation, that ſome of the moſt virulent Writers againſt Liberty of Conſcience, and others of the moſt fierce Inſtigators to the perſecuting <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> among whom we may reckon <hi>Parker</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and <hi>Cartwright</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> are, ſince Addreſſing for the <hi>Declaration of Indulgence</hi> became the means of being graciouſly look'd upon at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> turned for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Promoters of it, tho their Succeſs in their <hi>Dioceſſes</hi> with their Clergy, hath not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered their Expectations and Endeavors. For as theſe two <hi>Mytred Gentlemen</hi> will fall in with and juſtifie whatſoever the King hath a mind to do, if they may but keep their Seas, and enjoy their Revenues, which I dare ſay, that rather than loſe, they will ſubſcribe not only to the <hi>Tridentine Faith,</hi> but to the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> ſo it is moſt certain that they <hi>two</hi> as well as the Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> have promiſed to turn <hi>Roman Catholicks;</hi> and that as <hi>Crew</hi> hath been ſeveral times ſeen aſſiſting at the Celebration of the Maſs, and that as <hi>Cartwright</hi> paid a particular reſpect to the <hi>Nuncie</hi> at his ſolemn Entrance at <hi>Windſor,</hi> which ſome <hi>Temporal Lords</hi> had ſo much Conſcience and Honor, as to ſcorn to do, ſo the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Liege Letter</hi> tells us, that <hi>Parker</hi> not only extremely favors <hi>Popery,</hi> but that he brands in a manner all ſuch for <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> who continue to plead for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion. 'Tis an Act of the ſame Candor and good Nature in the King with the former, and another Royal Effect of his <hi>Princely Breeding,</hi> as well as of his <hi>Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> when he Endeavors to caſt a farther <hi>Odium</hi> upon the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and to exaſperate the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> againſt her, by ſaying in the forementioned <hi>Letter</hi> to Mr. <hi>Alſop, That the reaſon why the Diſſenters enjoyed not Liberty ſooner, is wholly owing to the Sollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Conforming Clergy; whereas many of the learned and ſober Men of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> could have been contented that the <hi>Non-conforming Proteſtants</hi> ſhould have had Liberty long ago, provided it had been granted in a legal way; and the chief Executioners of Severity upon them, were ſuch of all Ranks, Orders and Stations as the Court both ſet on and rewarded for it. 'Tis not their Brethrens having Liberty that diſpleaſeth modeſt and good Men of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> but 'tis the having it in the virtue of an <hi>Uſurped Prerogative</hi> over the Laws of the Land, and to the ſhaking all the legal Foundations of the Proteſtant Religion it ſelf in the Kingdom. And had the <hi>Declaration of Indulgence</hi> imported only an Exemption of <hi>Diſſenters</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> from Rigors and Penalties, I know very few that would have been diſpleaſed at it; but the extending it to the removing all the Fences about the Reformed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:48501:206"/>and Worſhip, and laying us open both to the tyranny of Papiſts, and the being overflowed with a deluge of their Superſtitions and Idolatries, as well as the deſigning it for a means to overthrow the eſtabliſhed <hi>Church,</hi> is that which no wiſe <hi>Diſſenter</hi> no more than a conformable man knows how to digeſt. For I am not of Sir <hi>R. L'Eſtrange</hi>'s mind, who after he hath been writing for many years againſt <hi>Diſſenters</hi> with all the venom and malice imaginable, and to diſprove the wiſdom, juſtice, and convenience of granting them liberty, hath now the impudence to publiſh <hi>that whatſoever he formerly wrote, bears an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act conformity to the preſent Reſolutions of State,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pref. to his Hiſt. of the Times.</hi> p. 8.</note> in that the liberty now vouchſafed is an Act of Grace iſſuing from the ſupreme Magiſtrate, and not a claim of Right in the people.</hi> And as to recited expreſſions of the <hi>King,</hi> they are only a <hi>papal</hi> trick whereby to keep up heats and animoſities among <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> when both the inward heats of men are much allay'd, and the external provocations to them are wholly removed, and they are merely <hi>Jeſuitick</hi> methods by which our hatred of one another may be maintain'd, tho the <hi>Laws</hi> enabling one party to perſecute the other, which was the chief ſpring of all our mutual rancor and bitterneſs, be ſuſpended. It would be the ſport and glory of the <hi>Ignatian Order,</hi> to be able to make the diſabling of <hi>penal Laws</hi> as effectual to the ſupporting differences among <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as the enacting and rigorous execution of them, was to the firſt raiſing, and the continuing them afterwards for many years. And if the foregoing <hi>Topicks</hi> can fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the <hi>King</hi> arguments whereby to reproach the <hi>Ch. of England,</hi> when he thinks it ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and for the intereſt of <hi>Rome</hi> to be angry with them; I dare affirm he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver want pretences of being diſcontented with and of aſperſing <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> when he finds the doing ſo, to be for the ſervice of the <hi>papal</hi> cauſe. And if the forementioned inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s behaviour to the <hi>Ch. of England</hi> to which he ſtands ſo ſuperlatively obliged, be neither teſtimonies of his Ingenuity, evidences of his Gratitude, nor effects of common, much leſs <hi>royal</hi> Juſtice; yet what remains to be intimated, does carry more viſible marks of his malice and deſign both againſt the <hi>legally</hi> eſtabliſhed <hi>Church</hi> and our <hi>Religion.</hi> For not being ſatisfied with the <hi>ſuſpenſion</hi> of all thoſe <hi>Laws,</hi> by which <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and they of the national <hi>Communion</hi> might ſeem to be injurious to <hi>Papiſts</hi> in their Perſons and Eſtates, ſuch as the <hi>Laws</hi> which make thoſe, who ſhall be found to have taken <hi>Orders</hi> in the <hi>Ch. of Rome,</hi> obnoxious to death, or thoſe other <hi>Statutes</hi> by which the <hi>King</hi> hath Power and Authority for levying <hi>two thirds</hi> of their <hi>Eſtates</hi> that ſhall be convicted of <hi>Recuſancy;</hi> but by an uſurped <hi>Prerogative</hi> and an abſolute <hi>Power</hi> he is pleaſed to <hi>ſuſpend</hi> all the <hi>Laws</hi> by which they were only diſabled from hurting us, thro ſtanding precluded from places of Power and Truſt in the Government. So that the whole ſecurity we have in time to come for our <hi>Religion,</hi> depends upon the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate diſpoſition and good nature of thoſe <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> that ſhall be advanced to Offices and Employments, and does no longer bear upon the protection and ſupport of the <hi>Law;</hi> and I think we have not had that experience of grace and favour from <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as may give us juſt confidence of fair and candid treatment from them for the future. Now that we may be the better convinced, how little ſecurity we have from his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s <hi>promiſe</hi> in his <hi>Declaration,</hi> of his protecting the <hi>Archbiſhops, Biſhops and Clergy, and all other his Subjects of the Church of England, in the free exerciſe of their Religion as by Law eſtabliſhed, and in the quiet and full enjoyment of their poffeſſions, without any moleſtation or diſturbance whatſoever,</hi> which is all the <hi>Tenour</hi> that is left us; 'tis not unworthy of obſervation how that beſide the ſuſpending the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>London ab Officio,</hi> and the <hi>Vice-Chancellor</hi> of <hi>Cambridge</hi> both <hi>ab Officio</hi> and <hi>Beneficio,</hi> and this not only for Actions which the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom</hi> make their duty, but thro a ſentence inflicted upon them by no <hi>legal Court</hi> of <hi>Judicature,</hi> but by 5 or 6 mercenary perſons ſupported by a tyrannous and arbitrary Commiſſion, his <hi>Majeſty</hi> in his <hi>Proclamation for Toleration in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> bearing date <hi>Febr.</hi> 12. doth among many other Laws, <hi>caſs, diſable,</hi> and <hi>diſpenſe</hi> with the Law enjoining the <hi>Scots Teſt,</hi> tho it was not only enacted by <hi>himſelf</hi> while he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented his Brother as his <hi>high Commiſſioner,</hi> but hath been confirmed by him in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> ſince he came to the <hi>Crown.</hi> Surely it is as eaſie to depart from a <hi>promiſe</hi> made in a <hi>Declaration,</hi> as 'tis to abſolve and diſcharge himſelf from the obligation of a <hi>Law</hi> which he firſt concurred to the enacting of, and gave the creating <hi>Fiat</hi> unto as the late King's <hi>Commiſſioner,</hi> and hath ſince ratified in <hi>Parliament</hi> after he was come to the Throne. As there is no more infidelity, diſhonor and injuſtice, ſo there is leſs of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power and illegality, in doing the one than the other. Nor is it poſſible for a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional man to place a confidence in his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Royal word for the <hi>protection</hi> of our <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Ch. of England</hi> mens enjoying their poſſeſſions, ſeeing he hath not only departed from his <hi>Promiſe</hi> made to the <hi>Council</hi> immediately after his <hi>Brother</hi>'s death, but hath violated his <hi>Faith</hi> given to the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England</hi> at their <hi>firſt Seſſion,</hi> which we might have thought would have been the more ſacred and binding, by reaſon of the Grandeur, State, and Quality of the Aſſembly to which it was pledged.</p>

            <p>If we conſider how much <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſuffered, what number of them was <hi>burnt</hi> at the <hi>Stake,</hi> as well as <hi>Murdered</hi> in <hi>Goals,</hi> beſide the vaſt Multitudes, who to avoid the Rage and Power of their Enemies, were forced to abandon their <hi>Country,</hi> and ſeek for ſhelter in <hi>foreign</hi> Parts, and what Endeavors of all kinds were uſed for the Extirpation of our Religion under Q. <hi>Mary;</hi> we may gather and learn from thence what is to be dreaded from <hi>James</hi> II. who is the next <hi>Popiſh Prince</hi> to her that ſince the <hi>Reformation</hi> hath ſat on the <hi>Throne</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> For though there be many things that adminiſter grounds of Hope, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> will not find it ſo eaſie a matter to bring us in <hi>ſhoals</hi> to the <hi>ſtake,</hi> nor of that quick and eaſie diſpatch to <hi>ſuppreſs</hi> the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and ſet up <hi>Popery,</hi> at this time as they found it then; yet every thing that occurs to our Thoughts, or that can affect our Underſtandings, ſerves not only to perſwade us into a belief that they will ſet upon and endeavor it, but to work us up to an Aſſurance that his <hi>Majeſty</hi> would take it for a diminution of his Glory, as well as reflection upon his Zeal for the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> not to attempt what a Woman had both the Courage to undertake, and the Fortune to go through with. And there is withal a Concurrence of ſo many things both abroad and at home at this Juncture, which if laid in the ballance with the Motives to our hope of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> miſcarrying, may juſtly raiſe our <hi>Fears</hi> of their proſpering to a very ſad and uncomfortable height. Whoſoever ſhall compare theſe two Princes together, will find that there was leſs danger to be apprehended from <hi>Mary,</hi> and that not only upon the ſcore of her <hi>Sex,</hi> but by reaſon of a certain gentleneſs and goodneſs of Nature which all <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> of Judgment and Credit aſcribe unto her; than is to be expected from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>King,</hi> in whom a Sourneſs of Temper, Fierceneſs of Diſpoſition, and Pride joined with a peeviſhneſs of humor not to bear the having his will diſputed or controlled, are the principal Ingredients into his Conſtitution, and which are all ſtrangely heightned and enflamed by contracted diſtempers of Body, and thro' furious Principles of Mind which he hath imbib'd from the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who of all Men carry the Obligations ariſing from the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the <hi>Popiſh Religion</hi> to the moſt outragious and inhuman Exceſſes. Nor can I forbear to add, that whereas the Cruelty which that <hi>Princeſs</hi> was hurried into, even to the making her Cities common Shambles, and her Streets Theatres of Murder for Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Perſons, for which ſhe became hated while ſhe lived, and her Memory is rendred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous to all Generations that come after, was wholly and entirely owing to her <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which not only proclaims it lawful, but a neceſſary duty of Chriſtianity, and an Act meriting a peculiar Crown of Glory in Heaven, to deſtroy <hi>Hereticks;</hi> 'tis to be feared there will be found in the preſent <hi>King</hi> a ſpice of <hi>revenge</hi> againſt us as we are <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> as well as a meaſure heapt up and running over of furious <hi>Papal Zeal</hi> againſt us as we are <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> Beſide the Wrath he bears unto us for our departure from the Communion of the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> and our Rebellion againſt the Triple Crown; the War wherein many of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> were engag'd againſt his <hi>Father,</hi> and the iſſue of it in the Execution of that <hi>Monarch,</hi> is what he hath been heard to ſay, <hi>That he hopes to revenge upon the Nation.</hi> And all that the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London</hi> underwent thro' that dreadful <hi>Conflagration</hi> 1666. of which he was the great Author and Promoter, as well as the Reſcuer and Protector of the <hi>Varlets</hi> that were apprehended in their ſpreading and carrying on the <hi>fire,</hi> is but <hi>earneſt</hi> in reſpect of what is deſign'd farther to be paid them, for the having been the great Supporters of that <hi>War,</hi> both by continu'd <hi>Recruits</hi> of Men, and repeated <hi>Supplies</hi> of Treaſure. Tho' it was Qu. <hi>Marys</hi> misfortune, and proved the miſery of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that ſhe was under the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of <hi>Popiſh Biſhops,</hi> and of <hi>Religious</hi> of ſeveral <hi>Orders,</hi> by whom <hi>ſhe</hi> was whetted on and provoked to thoſe Barbarities wherewith <hi>her</hi> Reign is ſtain'd and reproach'd; yet <hi>ſhe</hi> had no <hi>Jeſuits</hi> about <hi>her,</hi> to whom all the other <hi>Orders</hi> are but <hi>punies</hi> in the arts of wheedling and frighting <hi>Princes</hi> forward to Cruelty. The <hi>Society</hi> being then but in its Infancy, and the diſtance between its <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> which was in 1540. and the time of <hi>her</hi> coming to the <hi>Crown,</hi> which was <hi>A.</hi> 1553. not affording ſeaſon enough for their ſpreading ſo far abroad as they have ſince done, nor for the perfecting themſelves to that degree in the methods of Butchery, and in the <hi>Topicks</hi> whereby to delude <hi>Monarchs,</hi> to ſerve and promote their <hi>ſanguinary</hi> Paſſions, as they have in proceſs of time attain'd unto. Nor have the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> now any ſecurity for their <hi>Religion,</hi> whereby it or themſelves may be preſerv'd from the attempts of his <hi>Majeſty</hi> for the Extirpation of both, but what our Predeceſſors in the ſame <hi>Faith</hi> had in the like kind, tho' not to the ſame meaſure and degree, when Qu. <hi>Mary</hi> arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the Throne. For tho' our <hi>Religion</hi> was of late fenced about with more <hi>Laws,</hi> and we had <hi>Royal Promiſes</hi> oftner repeated for the having it preſerv'd, and our ſelves protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Profeſſion of it; yet it is certain that it had not only receiv'd a legal Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under <hi>K.

Mary</hi> laid to pledg in a <hi>Promiſe</hi> made to the Men of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> that nothing ſhould be done towards its Subverſion, or whereby they might be hindred in the free Exerciſe of it. But as neither <hi>Law</hi> nor <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> could prove reſtraints upon <hi>Mary,</hi> to hinder <hi>her</hi> from <hi>ſubverting Religion,</hi> and <hi>burning
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:48501:207"/>Proteſtants,</hi> ſo the Obligation of Gratitude that ſhe was under to the Men of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> for their coming in ſo ſeaſonably to her Aſſiſtance againſt the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>Northumb.</hi> who was in the field with an Army in the name of the <hi>Lady Jane Gray,</hi> whom the Council had proclaimed <hi>Queen,</hi> could not excuſe them from ſharing in the Severity that others met with, it being obſerved that more of that <hi>County</hi> were <hi>Burnt</hi> for Religion, than of any other <hi>Shire</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> And 'tis greatly to be feared, that this piece of her Example, will not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape being conform'd unto by the <hi>King</hi> in his Carriage towards thoſe that eminently ſerved <hi>him,</hi> as well as all the reſt of it in his Behaviour towards <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in general. Nor is it poſſible to conceive that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> living at that eaſe and quietneſs which they did under his <hi>late Majeſty,</hi> of whoſe being of their Religion they were not ignorant, as appears by the Proofs they have vouchſaf'd the World of it ſince his death, would have been in ſo many <hi>plots</hi> for deſtroying him, and at laſt have haſtned him to his <hi>Fathers,</hi> as can be demonſtrated whenſoever it is ſeaſonable, had they not been aſſur'd of more to be attempted by his <hi>Succeſſor</hi> for the Extirpation of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> than <hi>Charles</hi> could be wrought up unto, or prevail'd upon to expoſe his Perſon and Crown to the danger and hazard of. For as it is not merely a <hi>Prince</hi>'s being a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and mild, gentle, and favorable to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,</hi> that will content the fiery Zealots of the <hi>Roman Clergy</hi> and the <hi>Regular Orders,</hi> but he muſt both gratifie their Ambition in exalting them to a Condition above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and ſerve their inhuman Luſts and brutal Paſſions, in not ſuffering any to live in his Dominions that will not renounce the <hi>Northern Hereſie;</hi> ſo it is not more incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they ſhould diſpatch a <hi>Prince</hi> by an <hi>infuſion</hi> in a Cup of <hi>Tea</hi> or <hi>Chocolate,</hi> whom tho' they knew to be a <hi>Papiſt</hi> yet they found too cold and ſlow in promoting their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; than that they ſhould have murder'd another by a <hi>conſecrated Dagger</hi> in the hand of <hi>Ravilliac,</hi> the one being both more eaſie to be detected, and likelier to derive an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal <hi>Hatred</hi> and <hi>Revenge</hi> upon them than the other. And as the <hi>King</hi>'s being conſcious of that <hi>parricide</hi> committed upon his <hi>Brother,</hi> plainly tells us, that there is nothing ſo abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable and barbarous, which he hath not a Conſcience that will ſwallow and digeſt; ſo the Promotion of the <hi>Catholick Cauſe</hi> being the Motive to that horrid <hi>Crime,</hi> we may be ſure that what is hitherto done in favor of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> falls much ſhort of what is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there being ſomething more meritorious than all this amounts unto, needful to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone for ſo barbarous a Villany, which can be nothing elſe but the extirpating the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion</hi> out of the three <hi>Kingdoms.</hi> Nor is it probable that the preſent <hi>King,</hi> who is repreſented for a Perſon ambitious of Glory, would loſe the Opportunities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the preſent poſture of Affairs in the World preſents him, of being the <hi>Umpire</hi> and <hi>Arbiter</hi> of Chriſtendom, and of giving check to the Grandeur and Uſurpations of a neighboring <hi>Monarch,</hi> to whom all <hi>Europe</hi> is in danger of becoming enſlaved; if he were not ſwallowed up in the Thoughts of a Conqueſt over the Conſciences, Laws and Liberties of his own People, and of ſubjugating his Dominions to the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> and had he not Hopes and Aſſurances of Aid and Aſſiſtance therein from that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,</hi> as he is emboldned and encouraged thereunto by his Pattern and Example.</p>
            <p>What the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have all along been endeavoring for the Subverſion of our <hi>Religion,</hi> during and under the Reigns of <hi>Proteſtant Princes,</hi> may yet farther inform and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm us, what they will infallibly attempt upon their having gotten one into the <hi>Throne,</hi> who is not only in all things of their own <hi>Faith,</hi> but of an Humor agreeable unto their Deſires, and of a Temper every way ſuited and adapted to their Deſigns. Tho' the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> had obtain'd ſome entrance into ſeveral <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> and had made ſome conſiderable ſpread in <hi>Europe,</hi> before it came to be generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and eſtabliſhed upon Foundations of Law in <hi>England;</hi> yet they of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, were little able to defend themſelves from the Power and Malice of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of <hi>Popiſh Princes,</hi> and many of them were very unſucceſsful in Endeavors of that nature, till <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>Qu. Elizabeths</hi> time by eſpouſing their Cauſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking their Quarrel, not only wrought out their Safety, but made them flouriſh. This the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and the <hi>Prieſts</hi> grew immediately ſenſible of, and have therefore moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all their Counſels ever ſince againſt <hi>England,</hi> as being both the <hi>Bulwark</hi> of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Ballance</hi> of <hi>Europe.</hi> All the late attempts for the <hi>Extirpation</hi> of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> in <hi>France</hi> and elſewhere, are much to be aſcribed to the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the <hi>Papiſts</hi> had in the <hi>late King</hi> and his <hi>Brother</hi> of their giving no Diſcouragement nor Obſtruction to ſo <hi>holy</hi> a Deſign; and thereupon as the firſt <hi>Edicts</hi> for infringing the Liberty, and weakning and oppreſſing <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>perſecution</hi> in <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> commenced and bore date with the <hi>Reſtoration</hi> of the <hi>Royal Family,</hi> and multiplied, and encreaſed from year to year as they grew into farther aſſurance of the <hi>Royal Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> approving as well as conniving at what was done; ſo that for the <hi>abolition</hi> of the <hi>Edict</hi> of <hi>Nants,</hi> and the total Suppreſſion of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> was emitted upon his preſent <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s being exalted to the <hi>Throne,</hi> and the encouragement he gave
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:48501:208"/>them to a Procedure, which as he now juſtifies he will hereafter imitate. It were to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants</hi> exceedingly unacquainted with the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of their own <hi>Nation,</hi> to give a long Deduction of what the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have attempted for the <hi>Extirpation</hi> of our <hi>Religion,</hi> while we had <hi>Princes</hi> on the <hi>Throne</hi> whoſe Belief and Principles in Chriſtianity, led them to aſſert and defend the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and who had Courage as well as Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to puniſh thoſe that conſpired againſt it. Their many Conjurations againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Perſon, and their repeated Endeavors of bringing in <hi>Foreigners,</hi> and of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying the Nation to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were to convert the <hi>Kingdom</hi> as they had done the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> by killing the Inhabitants, are ſufficiently known to all who have allowed themſelves leiſure to read, or who have been careful to remember what they have been often told by thoſe that have inſpected the <hi>Memoirs</hi> of thoſe times. The <hi>Gunpowder-plot</hi> with the Motives unto it, and the extent of the miſchief it was ſhapen for, together with the inſurrection they were prepared for in caſe it had ſucceeded, and the foreign aid they had been ſolliciting and were promiſed, and all for the <hi>extirpation</hi> of <hi>Engliſh Hereticks,</hi> are things ſo modern, and which we have had ſo many times related to us by our Fathers, that it is enough barely to intimate them. The <hi>Iriſh Maſſacre</hi> in which above 200000 were murder'd in cold blood, and to which there was no provocation but that of <hi>hatred</hi> to our <hi>Religion,</hi> and furious <hi>zeal</hi> to extirpate <hi>Hereticks,</hi> ought at this time to be more particularly reflected upon, as that which gives us a true <hi>ſcheme</hi> of the manner of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>'s converting <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Kingdoms, and being the <hi>Copy</hi> they have a mind to write after, and that in ſuch Characters and lines of blood as may be ſure to anſwer the <hi>Original.</hi> At the ſeaſon when they both entred upon and executed that helliſh conjuration, they were in a quiet and peaceable enjoyment of the private exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their <hi>Religion,</hi> yea had many publick meeting-places, thro the means of the <hi>Queen</hi> and many great friends which they had at <hi>Court,</hi> and were neither diſturbed for not coming to Church, nor ſuffered any ſeverities upon the account of their Profeſſion; but that would not ſatisfie, nor will any thing elſe, unleſs they may be allowed to cut the throats, or make <hi>bonefires,</hi> of all that will not join with them in a blind obedience to the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of worſhipping S. <hi>Patrick.</hi> The little harſh uſages which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> at any time met with there or in <hi>England,</hi> they derived them upon themſelves by their <hi>Crimes</hi> againſt the <hi>State,</hi> and for their <hi>Conſpiracies</hi> againſt our <hi>Princes</hi> and their <hi>Proteſtant Subjects.</hi> For till the <hi>Pope</hi> had taken upon him to <hi>depoſe Queen Elizabeth,</hi> and <hi>abſolve</hi> her <hi>Subjects</hi> from their <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and till the <hi>Papiſts</hi> had ſo far approved that <hi>Act</hi> of his <hi>Holineſs</hi> as to raiſe Rebellions at home and enter into treaſonable confederacies abroad, there were no <hi>Laws</hi> that could be ſtiled ſevere enacted in <hi>England</hi> againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and the making of them was the reſult of neceſſity in order to preſerve our ſelves, and not from an inclination to hurt any for matters of mere Religion. Such hath always been the moderation of our <hi>Rulers,</hi> and ſo powerful are the incitements to lenity, which the generality of Proteſtants through the influence and impreſſion of their Religion, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially they of a more generous education, have been under towards thoſe of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Communion, that nothing but their unwearied reſtleſneſs to diſturb the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and deſtroy Proteſtants, hath been the cauſe either of enacting thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them that are ſtiled rigorous, or of their having been at any time put into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. And notwithſtanding that ſome ſuch <hi>Laws</hi> were enacted as might appear to ſavour of ſeverity, yet could they have but ſubmitted to have dwelt peaceably in the Land, they would have found that their mere belief and the private practice of their Worſhip, would not have much prejudiced or endangered them, and that tho the <hi>Laws</hi> had been continued unrepealed, yet it was only as a Hedge about us for our protection, and as Bonds of obligation upon them to their good behaviour. To which may be added, that more Proteſtants have ſuffered in one year, by the Laws made againſt Diſſenters, and to the utmoſt height of the penalties which the violation of them imported, and that by the inſtigation of Papiſts and their influence over the late King and his preſent Majeſty, than there have Papiſts from the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign to this very day, tho there was a difference in the puniſhments they underwent. However we may from their many and repeated attempts againſt us, while we had Princes that both would and could chaſten their inſolencies, and inflict upon them what the Law made them obnoxious unto for their outrages, gather and conclude what we are now to expect, upon their having obtained a <hi>King</hi> imbu'd with all the perſecuting and bloody principles of Popery, and perfectly baptiſed into all the Doctrines of the <hi>Councils</hi> of <hi>Lateran</hi> and <hi>Conſtance.</hi> And it may ſtrengthen our faith as well as increaſe our fear, of what is purpoſed againſt and impends over us, in that they cannot but think that the ſuffering our Religion to remain in a condition to be at any time hereafter the Religion of the State, and of the univerſality of the People, may not only prove a means of retrieving Proteſtancy in <hi>France,</hi> and of aſſiſting to
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:48501:208"/>revenge the barbarities perpetrated there upon a great and innocent people, but may leave the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> in <hi>England</hi> expoſed to the reſentment of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> for what they have ſo fooliſhly and impudently acted both againſt our <hi>Civil Rights,</hi> and <hi>Eſtabliſhed Religion,</hi> ſince <hi>James</hi> II. came to the Crown; and may alſo upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's falling into good hands, and Magiſtrates coming to underſtand their true Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, which is for an <hi>Engliſh Prince</hi> to make himſelf the Head of the <hi>Proteſtant cauſe,</hi> and to eſpouſe their quarrel in all places, give ſuch a Revolution in <hi>Europe</hi> as will not only check the preſent Career of <hi>Rome,</hi> but cauſe them repent the methods in which they have been engaged. Theſe things we may be ſure the Papiſts are aware of, and that having proceeded ſo far, they have nothing left for their ſecurity from puniſhments becauſe of crimes committed, but to put us out of all capacity of doing our ſelves Right and them Juſtice; and he muſt be dull who does not know into what that muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily hurry them.</p>
            <p>It being then as evident as a matter of this nature is capable of, what we are to expect and dread from the King both as to our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Laws;</hi> we may do more than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that the late <hi>Declaration for liberty of Conſcience,</hi> and the <hi>Proclamation for a Toleration,</hi> are not intended and deſigned for the benefit and advantage of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> and that whatſoever motives have influenced to the granting and emitting of them, they do not in the leaſt flow or proceed from any kindneſs and good will to Proteſtant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters. And though many of thoſe weak and eaſie People may flatter themſelves with a belief of an intereſt in the <hi>Kings</hi> favour, and ſuffer others to delude them into a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion of his bearing a gracious reſpect towards them; yet it is certain, that they are People in the world whom he moſt hates, and who when things are ripe for it, and that he hath abuſed their credulity into a ſerving his Ends as far as they can be prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, and as long as the preſent <hi>Juggle</hi> can be of any advantage for promoting the Papal Cauſe, will be ſure not only to have an equal ſhare in his diſpleaſure with their Brethren of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but will be made to drink deepeſt in the cup of fury and wrath that is mingling and preparing for all Proteſtants. No provocation from their preſent behaviour, tho it is ſuch as might warm a perſon of very cool temper, much leſs offences of another complexion adminiſtred by any of them, ſhall ever tempt me to ſay they deſerve it, or cauſe me to ravel into their former and paſt carriages, ſo as to faſten a blot or imputation upon the party or body of them, whatſoever I may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to do as to particular perſons among them. For as to the generality, I do believe them to be as honeſt, induſtrious, uſeful, and vertuous a people (tho many of them be none of the wiſeſt nor of the greateſt proſpect) as any party of men in the Kingdom, and that wherein ſoever their carriage (even abſtracting from their differences with their Fellow Proteſtants in matters of Religion) hath varied from that of other Subjects; they have been in the Right, and have acted moſt agreeably to the intereſt and ſafety of the Kingdom. But it can be no reflection upon them, to recall into their memories, that the whole tenor of the <hi>King</hi>'s actings towards them both when Duke of <hi>York</hi> and ſince <hi>he</hi> came to the Crown, hath been ſuch as might render it beyond diſpute, that they are ſo far from having any ſingular room in his favour, that he bears them neither pity nor compaſſion, but that they are the objects of his unchangeable indignation. For not to mention how the Perſecutions, that were obſerved always to relent both upon his being at any diſtance from the <hi>late King,</hi> and upon the abatement of his influence at any time into Counſels, were conſtantly revived upon his return to <hi>Court,</hi> and were carried on in degrees of ſeverity proportionable to the <hi>figure</hi> he made at <hi>Whitehall</hi> and his <hi>Brothers</hi> diſpoſedneſs and inclination to hearken to him; ſurely their memories cannot be ſo weak and untenacious, but they muſt remember how their ſufferings were never greater, nor the <hi>Laws</hi> executed with more ſeverity upon them, than ſince his <hi>Majeſty</hi> came to aſcend the <hi>Throne.</hi> As it is not many years ſince he ſaid publickly in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that it were well if all that part of the Kingdom, (which is above half of the Nation) where the Diſſenters were known to be moſt numerous, <hi>were turned into a hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing field;</hi> ſo none were favoured and promoted either <hi>there</hi> or in <hi>England,</hi> but ſuch as were taken to be the moſt fierce and violent of all others againſt <hi>Fanaticks.</hi> Nor were men preferred either in Church or State for their learning, vertue or merit, but for their paſſionate heats and brutal rigours to <hi>Diſſenters.</hi> And whereas the Papiſts from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt day of his arrival at the Government, had beſide many other marks of <hi>his Grace,</hi> this ſpecial Teſtimony of it, of not having the <hi>penal Statutes</hi> to which they ſtood liable put in execution againſt them; all the <hi>Laws</hi> to which the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> were obnoxious, were by his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Orders to the <hi>Judges, Juſtices</hi> of the <hi>Peace,</hi> and all other <hi>Officers Civil</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> moſt unmercifully executed. Nor was there the leaſt talk of lenity to <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> till the <hi>King</hi> found that he could not compaſs his Ends by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and prevail upon the <hi>Parliament</hi> for repealing the <hi>Teſts,</hi> and cancelling the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:48501:209"/>other <hi>Laws</hi> in force againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> which if they could have been wrought over unto, the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> would not only have been left Pitileſs, and continued in the Hands of the furious Church men to exerciſe their Spleen upon, but would have been ſurrendred as a Sacrifice to new Flames of Wrath, if they of the Prelatical Communion had retained their wonted Animoſity, and thought it for their Intereſt to exert it, either in the old or in freſh Methods. But that Project not ſucceeding, his <hi>Majeſty</hi> is forced to ſhift Hands, and to uſe the Pretence of extending Compaſſion to <hi>Diſſenting Proteſtants,</hi> that he may the more plauſibly, and with the leſs Hazard, ſuſpend and diſable the <hi>Laws</hi> againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and make way for their Admiſſion into all Offices Civil and Military, which is the firſt Step, and all that he is yet in a Condition to take, for the <hi>Subverſion</hi> of our <hi>Religion.</hi> And all the celebrated Kindneſs to <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> is only to uſe them as the <hi>Cat's</hi> Paw, for pulling the Cheſunt out of the Fire to the <hi>Monkey,</hi> and to make them <hi>ſtales</hi> under whoſe Shroud and Covert, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may undermine and ſubvert all the <hi>legal Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations</hi> of our <hi>Religion,</hi> which to ſuffer themſelves to be Inſtrumental in, will not in the Iſſue turn to the Commendation of the <hi>Diſſenters Wiſdom</hi> or their <hi>Honeſty.</hi> Nor is there more Truth in the <hi>King</hi>'s declaring it to <hi>have been his conſtant Opinion, that Conſcience ought not to be conſtrained, nor People forced in Matters of mere Religion,</hi> than there is of <hi>Juſtice</hi> in that malicious <hi>Inſiuuation,</hi> (in his Letter to Mr. <hi>Alſop</hi>) againſt the Church of <hi>England, That ſhould he ſee cauſe to change his Religion, he ſhould never be of that Party of Proteſtants, who think their only way to advance their Church, is by undoing thoſe Churches of Chriſtians that differ from them in ſmaller Matters:</hi> Foraſmuch as he is in the mean time a Member of the moſt Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting and Bloody Society, that ever was cloathed with the name of a Church, and whoſe Cruelty towards Proteſtants he is careful not to Arraign, by faſtning his Offence at Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity upon Differences in <hi>ſmaller Matters,</hi> which he knows that thoſe between <hi>Rome</hi> and us are not, nor ſo accounted of by any of the <hi>Papal Fellowſhip.</hi> It were to be wiſhed that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> would reflect and conſider, how when the <hi>late King</hi> had emitted a <hi>Declaration</hi> of <hi>Indulgence, Anno</hi> 1672. upon pretended Motives of <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> and <hi>Compaſſion</hi> to his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Subjects,</hi> but in truth to keep all quiet at home, when in Conjunction with <hi>France,</hi> he was engaging in an unjuſt War againſt a <hi>Reformed State</hi> abroad, and in order to ſteal a Liberty for the Papiſts to Practiſe their Idolatries, without incurring a Suſpition himſelf, of being of the <hi>Romiſh Religion,</hi> and in hope to wind up the Prerogative to a Paramount Power over the Law; and how when the <hi>Parliament</hi> condemned the Illegality of it, and would have the <hi>Declaration</hi> recalled, all his Kindneſs to <hi>Diſſenters</hi> not only imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately vaniſhed, but turned into that Rage and Fury, that tho both that <hi>Parliament</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed for ſome Favor to be ſhew'd them, and another voted it a <hi>Betraying</hi> of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion</hi> to continue the Execution of the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> upon them, yet inſtead of their having any Mercy or Moderation exerciſed towards them, they were thrown into a <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,</hi> made ſeven times hotter than that wherein they had been ſcorched before. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pretending to be a Prophet. I dare prognoſticate and foretell, that whenſoever the preſent <hi>King</hi> hath compaſſed the Ends, unto which this <hi>Declaration</hi> is deſigned to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient, namely, the placing the Papiſts both in the open Exerciſe of their Religion, and in all publick <hi>Offices</hi> and <hi>Truſts,</hi> and the getting a Power to be acknowledged veſted in him over the <hi>Laws;</hi> that then, inſtead of the ſtill Voice calmly whiſpered from <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> they will both hear and feel the Blaſts of a mighty ruſhing Wind, and that upon pretended Occaſions ariſing from the Abuſe of this <hi>Indulgence,</hi> or for ſome alledged Crimes wherein they and all other Proteſtants are to be involved, (tho their ſupineneſs and exceſs of Loyalty continue to be their greateſt Offences) this Liberty will not only be withdrawn, and the old Church of <hi>England</hi> Severities revived, but ſome of the new <hi>à là mode à France</hi> Treatments come upon the Stage, and be purſued againſt them, and all other perverſe and obſtinate <hi>Britiſh Hereticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> being injurious to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and not proceeding from any inward and real good Will to the <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> it will be worth our pains to inquire into, and make a more ample Deduction of the Reaſons upon which it was granted, that the Grounds of emitting it being laid under every Man's view, they who have <hi>Addreſſed</hi> may come to be aſham'd of their Simplicity and Folly, they who have not, may be farther confirm'd both of the Unlawfulneſs and Inconveniency of doing it, and that all who preſerve any regard to the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> and the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> may be quickened to the uſe of all legal and due means for preventing the miſchievous Effects which it is ſhapen for, and which the Papiſts do promiſe themſelves from it. The <hi>Motives</hi> upon which His <hi>Majeſty</hi> publiſhed the <hi>Declaration,</hi> may be reduced to <hi>three,</hi> of which, as I have already made ſome mention, ſo I ſhall now place every one of them in its ſeveral and proper light, and give ſuch Proofs and Evidence of their being the great and ſole <hi>Inducements</hi> for the <hi>Emitting</hi> of it, that no rational Man ſhall be able, henceforth, to make a doubt of it. The firſt, is the <hi>King</hi>'s winding himſelf into a <hi>Supremacy</hi>
               <pb n="397" facs="tcp:48501:209"/>and <hi>Abſoluteneſs</hi> over the <hi>Law,</hi> and the getting it acknowledged, and calmly ſubmitted unto and acquieſced in by the <hi>Subjects.</hi> The <hi>Monarchies</hi> being <hi>Legal</hi> and not <hi>Deſpotical,</hi> bounded and regulated by <hi>Laws,</hi> and not to be exerciſed according to mere Will and Pleaſure, was that which he could not digeſt the thoughts of when a Subject, and had been heard to ſay, <hi>That he had rather Reign a day in that Abſoluteneſs that the French King doth, than an Age tied up and reſtrained by Rules as his Brother did.</hi> And therefore to perſwade the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to approve what he had done, in <hi>diſpenſing</hi> with the <hi>Laws,</hi> and to obtain him and the Princeſs to joyn with His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and to employ their Intereſt in the Kingdom for the <hi>Repealing</hi> the <hi>Teſt Acts,</hi> and the many other <hi>Statutes</hi> made againſt <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> he uſed this Argument in a Meſſage he ſent to their <hi>Royal Highneſſes</hi> upon that Errand, that the getting it done, would be greatly to the Advantage, and <hi>for the increaſe of the Prerogative;</hi> but this theſe two noble Princes, of whoſe Aſcent to the Throne all Proteſtants have ſo near and comfortable a Proſpect, were too Generous, as well as Wiſe, to be wheedled with, as knowing that the Authority of the Kings and Queens of <hi>England</hi> is great enough, by the Rules of the <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> without graſping at a new Prerogative Power, which as the <hi>Laws</hi> have not veſted in them, ſo it would be of no uſe, but to inable them to do hurt. And indeed it is more neceſſary, both for the Honor and Safety of the <hi>Monarch,</hi> and for the Freedom and Security of the People, that the Prerogative ſhould be confined within its ancient and legal <hi>Channels,</hi> than be left to that illimited and unbounded Latitude, which the <hi>late King</hi> and his <hi>preſent Majeſty</hi> have endeavored to advance and ſcrew it up unto. That both the <hi>Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience in</hi> England, and the <hi>Proclamation for a Toleration in</hi> Scotland, are calculated for raiſing the <hi>Sovereign Authority</hi> to a tranſcendent Power over the <hi>Laws</hi> of the two <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> may be demonſtrated from the Papers themſelves, which lay the <hi>Diſpenſing Power</hi> before us in terms that import no leſs than his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s ſtanding Free and abſolved from all Ties and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints, and his being cloathed with a Right of doing whatſoever he will. For if the Stile of <hi>Royal Pleaſure</hi> to ſuſpend the Execution of ſuch and ſuch <hi>Laws,</hi> and to forbid ſuch and ſuch <hi>Oaths</hi> to be required to be taken, and this in the virtue of no <hi>Authority</hi> declared by the <hi>Laws</hi> to be reſident in his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> but in the virtue of a certain vagrant and indeterminate thing called <hi>Royal Prerogative,</hi> as the Power exerciſed in the <hi>Engliſh Declaration</hi> is worded and expreſſed, be not enough to enlighten us ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently in the matter before us; the <hi>Stile of Abſolute Power, which all the Subjects are to obey without reſerve,</hi> whereby the King is pleaſed to chalk before us, the <hi>Authority</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted in the <hi>Scots Proclamation,</hi> for the <hi>ſtopping, diſabling, and diſpenſing with</hi> ſuch and ſuch <hi>Laws</hi> as are there referred unto, and for the <hi>granting</hi> the <hi>Toleration</hi> with the other <hi>Liberties, Immunities</hi> and <hi>Rights</hi> there mentioned, is more than ſufficient to ſet the Point we are diſcourſing beyond all poſſibility of rational controll. As 'tis one and the ſame Kind of <hi>Authority</hi> that is claimed over the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Subjects</hi> of both <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> tho for ſome certain reaſons it be more modeſtly deſigned and expreſſed in the <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for a Liberty in</hi> England, that it is in the <hi>Proclamation</hi> for a <hi>Toleration in Scotland;</hi> ſo the utmoſt that the <hi>Czar</hi> of <hi>Moſco,</hi> the great <hi>Mogul,</hi> or the <hi>Turkiſh Sultan</hi> ever challenged over their reſpective Dominions, amounts only to an <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> which the King both owns the Exertion of, and makes it the <hi>Fountain</hi> of all the <hi>Royal Acts</hi> exerciſed in the forementioned Papers. And as the improving this challenged <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> into an <hi>Obligation</hi> upon the <hi>Subjects to obey his Majeſty without reſerve,</hi> is a <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe</hi> upon <hi>Deſpotical Dominion,</hi> and an advancing it to a Pitch, above what any of the Ancient or Modern <hi>Tyrants</hi> ever dream'd of, and beyond what the moſt ſervile part of Mankind was ever acquainted with, till the preſent <hi>French King</hi> gave an Inſtance of it, in making his <hi>mere Will and pleaſure</hi> to be the Ground and Argument upon which his Reformed Subjects were to renounce their Religion, and to turn <hi>Roman Catholicks;</hi> ſo it is worth conſidering, whether His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> who glories to imitate that <hi>Foreign Monarch,</hi> may not, in a little time, make the like Application of this <hi>Abſolute Power, which his Subjects are bound to obey without reſerve;</hi> and whether in that caſe, they who have <hi>Addreſſed</hi> to thank him for his <hi>Declaration,</hi> and thereby juſtified the Claim of this <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> being that upon which the <hi>Declaration</hi> is ſuperſtructed, and from which it emergeth, can avoid paying the Obedience that is demanded as a Duty in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, inſeparably annexed thereunto. That which more confirms us, that the <hi>Engliſh Declaration</hi> and the <hi>Scots Proclamation,</hi> are not only deſigned for the obtaining from the Subjects an Acknowledgment of an Abſolute Power veſted in the <hi>King,</hi> but that no leſs than the <hi>Uſurpation</hi> and <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of ſuch a Power, can warrant and ſupport them, are the many <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Rights,</hi> which a Juriſdiction is challenged over and exerted in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto, in the Papers ſtiled by the forementioned Names. All confeſs a Royal Prerogative ſettled on the Crown, and appertaining to the Royal Office; nor can the
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:48501:210"/>Supreme Magiſtrate be executed and diſcharged to the Advantage and Safety of the Community, without a Power affixed unto it of ſuperceding the Execution of ſome <hi>Laws</hi> at certain Junctures, nor without having an Authority over the Rights of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Men in ſome incident caſes; but then the received Cuſtoms of the reſpective Nations, and the univerſal Good, Preſervation and Safety of the People in general, are the Meaſures by which this Prerogative in the Crown is to be regulated, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which to apply or exert it, is an <hi>Uſurpation</hi> and <hi>Tyranny</hi> in the <hi>Ruler.</hi> All the Power belonging to the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Queens</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> ariſeth from an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Conceſſion of the People, wherein it is <hi>ſtipulated,</hi> what <hi>Rights, Liberties</hi> and <hi>Privileges</hi> they reſerved unto themſelves, and what <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> they <hi>delegated</hi> and made over unto the <hi>Sovereign,</hi> in order to his being in a Condition to protect and defend them, and that they may the better live in Peace, Freedom and Safety, which are the <hi>Ends</hi> for which they have choſen <hi>Kings</hi> to be over them, and for the compaſſing whereof, they originally ſubmitted unto, and pitched upon ſuch a <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Civil Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</hi> Nor are the <hi>Opinions</hi> of particular Men, of what Rank or Order ſoever they be, to be admitted as an Expoſition of the Extent of this <hi>Prerogative,</hi> ſeeing they, through their Dependencies upon the <hi>King,</hi> and their Obnoxiouſneſs to be influenced by ſelfiſh and perſonal <hi>Ends,</hi> may enlarge it beyond what is for the Benefit of the <hi>Community;</hi> but the immemorial courſe of <hi>Adminiſtration,</hi> with the Senſe of the whole <hi>Society</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by their <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> upon emerging <hi>Occaſions,</hi> are to be taken for the <hi>Senſe, Paraphraſe</hi> and <hi>Declaration</hi> of the <hi>Limits</hi> of this <hi>Royal</hi> and <hi>Prerogative Power;</hi> and for any to determine the Bounds of it from the Teſtimonies of <hi>Mercenary Lawyers,</hi> or <hi>Sycophant Clergy-men,</hi> in Caſes wherein the <hi>Parliament</hi> have, by their <hi>Votes</hi> and <hi>Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,</hi> ſettled its <hi>Boundaries,</hi> is a Crime that deſerves the ſevereſt <hi>Animadverſion,</hi> and, which it is to be hoped, a true <hi>Engliſh Parliament</hi> will not let paſs unpuniſhed.

<pb n="399" facs="tcp:48501:210"/>groaned under for ſeveral Ages; but as the <hi>King</hi> is hereby deprived of the greateſt <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> he had from his <hi>Subjects,</hi> both to himſelf and the <hi>Government,</hi> ſo the <hi>Crown</hi> is rob'd of one of its chiefeſt Jewels, namely, an <hi>Authority</hi> over all the <hi>Subjects,</hi> which was thought ſo eſſential to <hi>Sovereignty</hi> and <hi>Royal Dignity,</hi> that it was annexed to the <hi>Imperial Crown</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and adjudged inherent in the <hi>Monarch,</hi> before the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> came to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and eſtabliſhed. And it concerns their <hi>Royal Highneſſes</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> to whom the <hi>Right</hi> of ſucceeding to the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Great Britain</hi> unqueſtionably belongs, to conſider whether his Majeſty may not, by the ſame Authority whereby he alienates and gives away ſo conſiderable and inherent a <hi>Branch</hi> of the <hi>Royal Juriſdiction,</hi> transfer the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> it ſelf, and diſpoſe the <hi>Inheritance</hi> of the <hi>Crown</hi> to whom he pleaſeth. Nor will they about him, who thruſt the laſt King out of the Throne, to make room for his preſent Majeſty, much ſcruple to put a Proteſtant Succeſſor by it, if they can find another Papiſt as Bigotted as this to advance unto it. However, were they on the <hi>Throne</hi> to morrow, here is both a <hi>Foreign Juriſdiction</hi> brought in and ſet up to Rival and control theirs, and they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all means of being ſecured of the <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Fealty</hi> of a great number of their <hi>Subjects.</hi> Nor will <hi>His Majeſty's certain Knowledge and long Experience</hi> (whereof he boaſts in the <hi>Scots Proclamation</hi>) <hi>that the Catholicks, as it is their Principle to be good Chriſtians, ſo it is to be dutiful Subjects,</hi> be enough for their <hi>Royal Highneſſes</hi> to rely upon, their <hi>Religion</hi> obliging them to the contrary towards Princes, whom the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath adjudged to be <hi>Hereticks.</hi> A ſecond Inſtance wherein this pretended Royal Prerogative is exerciſed Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to all <hi>Laws,</hi> and which nothing but a claim of Abſolute Power in his Majeſty can ſupport, and an Acknowledgment of it by the Subjects, make them approve the <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> and the <hi>Proclamation for Toleration;</hi> is the ſtopping, diſabling and ſuſpending the <hi>Statutes</hi> whereby the <hi>Teſts</hi> were enacted, and thereby letting the Papiſts in to all Benefices, Offices, and Places of Truſt, whether Civil, Military, or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick. I do not ſpeak of Suſpending the Execution of thoſe <hi>Laws,</hi> whereby the being Prieſts, or taking Orders in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the being reconciled to that Church, or the Papiſts meeting to celebrate <hi>Maſs,</hi> were in one degree or another made Puniſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, (tho the King's diſpenſing with them by a challenged Claim in the <hi>Crown</hi> be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Illegal</hi>) for as divers of theſe <hi>Laws</hi> were never approved by many Proteſtants, ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would have juſtified the making of them, but the many <hi>Treaſons</hi> and <hi>Conſpiracies</hi> that they were from time to time found guilty of againſt the State. And as the Papiſts, of all Men, have the leaſt cauſe to complain of the Injuſtice, Rigor, and Severity of them, conſidering the many <hi>Laws,</hi> more Cruel and Sanguinary, that are in Force in moſt Popiſh Countries againſt Proteſtants, and theſe enacted and executed merely for their Opinions and Practices in the Matters of God, without their being chargeable with Crimes and Offences againſt the Civil Government under which they live, ſo were it neceſſary from Principles of Religion and Policy, to relieve the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> from the forementioned <hi>Laws,</hi> yet it ought not to be done but by the <hi>Legiſlative Authority</hi> of the <hi>Kingdoms;</hi> and for the King to aſſume a Power of doing it in the vertue of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Prerogative, is both a high <hi>Uſurpation</hi> over the <hi>Laws,</hi> and a <hi>Violation</hi> of his <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation Oath.</hi> Nor is it any Commendation either of the Humanity of the Papiſts, or of the Meekneſs and Truth of their Religion, that while they elſewhere treat thoſe who differ from them in Faith and Worſhip with that Barbarity, they ſhould ſo clamorouſly inveigh againſt the Severities which in ſome Reformed States they are liable unto, and which their <hi>Treaſons</hi> gave the Riſe and Provocation unto at firſt, and have been at all times the Motives to the Infliction of. But they alone would have the Allowance to be Cruel, wherein they act conſonantly to their own Tenets; and I wiſh that ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion might be made for the future, for the Security of our Religion, and our Safety in the Profeſſion of it, without the doing any thing that may unbecome the Merciful Principles of Chriſtianity, or be unſuitable to the meek and generous Temper of the Engliſh Nation; and that the Property of being <hi>Sanguinary</hi> may be left to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as its peculiar Priviledge and Glory, and as a more diſtinguiſhing <hi>Character</hi> than all the other Marks which ſhe pretends unto. That which I am ſpeaking of, is the Suſpending the Execution of thoſe <hi>Laws,</hi> by which the Government was ſecured of the Fidelity of its Subjects, and by which they, in whom it could not confide, were merely ſhut out from Places of Power and Truſt, and were made liable to very ſmall Damages themſelves, and only hindered from getting into a Condition of doing Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to us. All Governments have a Right to uſe means for their own Preſervation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they be not ſuch as are inconſiſtent with the <hi>Ends</hi> of Government, and repugnant to the Will and Pleaſure of the <hi>Supreme Sovereign</hi> of <hi>Mankind;</hi> and it is in the Power of every <hi>Legiſlative Aſſembly,</hi> to declare who of the <hi>Community</hi> ſhall be capable or incapable of publick Imploys, and of poſſeſſing Offices, upon which the Peace, Welfare and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the whole Politick Body does depend. Without this no Government could
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:48501:211"/>ſubſiſt, nor the People be in Safety under it; but the Conſtitution would be in conſtant danger of being Subverted, and the Privileges, Liberties and Religion of the <hi>Subjects</hi> laid open to be overthrown. And ſhould ſuch a Power in <hi>Legiſlators,</hi> be upon weak Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ill grounded Jealouſies, carried at any time too far, and ſome prove to be debarred from Truſts, whoſe being imployed would import no Hazard; yet the worſt of that, would be only a diſreſpect ſhewn to individual Perſons, who might deſerve more Favor and Eſteem, but could be of no Prejudice to the <hi>Society,</hi> there being always a ſufficient number of others, fit for the diſcharge of all <hi>Offices,</hi> in whom an entire Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence may be repoſed. And 'tis remarkable, that the <hi>States General</hi> of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> who afford the greateſt Liberty to all Religions, that any known State in <hi>Europe</hi> giveth; yet they ſuffer no Papiſts to come into Places of <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Judicature,</hi> nor to bear any Office in the Republick, that may either put them into a Condition, or lay them under a Temptation of attempting any thing to the Prejudice of Religion, or for the betraying the Liberty of the Provinces. And as 'tis Lawful for any Government to preclude all ſuch Perſons from publick Truſts, of whoſe Enemity, and ill Will to the Eſtabliſhment in Church or State, they have either a moral Certainty, or juſt Grounds of Suſpition; ſo 'tis no leſs lawful to provide Teſts for their Diſcovery and Detection, that they may not be able to mask and vizor themſelves in order to getting into Offices, and thereupon of promoting and accompliſhing their miſchievous and malicious Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Nor is it poſſible in ſuch a caſe, but that the Teſts they are to be tried by, muſt relate to ſome of thoſe Principles by which they are moſt eminently diſtinguiſhed from them of the National Settlement, and in reference whereunto they think it moſt piacular to diſſemble their Opinion. Nor have the Papiſts cauſe to be offended, that the <hi>Renouncing the Belief of Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> ſhould be required as the diſtinguiſhing Mark, whereby, upon their refuſal, they may be diſcerned, when all the Penalty upon their being known, is only to be excluded from a Share in the <hi>Legiſlation,</hi> and not to be admitted to Employments of Truſt and Profit; ſeeing it hath been, and ſtill is their Cuſtom, to require the <hi>Belief of the Corporal Preſence in the Sacrament,</hi> as that upon the not Acknowledgment whereof, we are to be accounted <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and to ſtand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be Burnt, which is ſomewhat worſe than the not being allowed to ſit in the Two <hi>Houſes of Parliament,</hi> or to be ſhut out from a <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Military Office.</hi> Neither are they required to Declare, much leſs to Swear, that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is <hi>Falſe, or that there is no ſuch thing as Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> (as is affirmed in a Scurrilous Paper written againſt the Loyalty of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) but all that is enjoyned in the <hi>Teſt Acts,</hi> is, that <hi>I,</hi> A. B. <hi>do declare, that I do believe that there is not any Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, or in the Elements of Bread and Wine, at or after the Conſecration thereof by any Prrſon whatſoever.</hi> Tho the Parliament was willing to uſe all the Care they could, for the diſcovering Papiſts, that the Proviſion for our Security, unto which thoſe Acts were deſigned, might be the more effectual; yet they were not ſo void of Underſtanding, as to preſcribe a Method for it, which would have expoſed them to the World for their Folly: 'Tis much different to ſay, Swear, or Declare, that <hi>I do believe there is not any Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and the ſaying or declaring that <hi>there is not a Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> the former being only expreſſive of what my Sentiment or Opinion is, and not at all affecting the Doctrine it ſelf, to make, or unmake it, other than what it is, independently upon my Judgment of it; whereas the latter does primarily <hi>Affect</hi> the <hi>Object</hi> and the Determination of its Exiſtence to ſuch a Mode as I conceive it; and there are a thouſand things which I can ſay that I do not believe, but I dare not ſay that they are not. Now as 'tis the diſpenſing with theſe Laws that argues the King's aſſuming an Abſolute Power; ſo the Addreſſing by way of Thanks, for the <hi>Declaration</hi> wherein this Power is exerted, is no leſs than an owning and acknowledging of it, and that it right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully belongs to him. There is a third thing which Shame or Fear would not ſuffer them to put into the <hi>Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience in</hi> England, but which they have had the Impudence to inſert into the <hi>Proclamation for a Toleration in</hi> Scotland, which as it carries <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> written in the forehead of it, ſo it is ſuch an unpreſidented Exerciſe of <hi>Deſpoticalneſs,</hi> as hardly any of the <hi>Oriental Tyrants,</hi> or even the <hi>French Leviathan</hi> would have ventured upon. For having ſtop'd, diſabled and ſuſpended all <hi>Laws</hi> enjoyning any Oaths, whereby our Religion was ſecured, and the Preſervation of it to us and our Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was provided for; he impoſeth a new <hi>Oath</hi> upon his <hi>Scots Subjects,</hi> whereby they are to be bound to <hi>defend and maintaim him, his Heirs and lawful Succeſſors, in the Exerciſe of their Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Power and Authority againſt all deadly.</hi> The impoſing an <hi>Oath</hi> upon <hi>Subjects</hi> hath been always look'd upon as the higheſt <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Legiſlative Authority,</hi> in that it affects their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and requires the Approbation, or Diſapprobation of their Minds and Judgments, in reference to whatſoever it is enjoyned for; whereas a <hi>Law</hi> that affects only Mens Eſtates may be ſubmitted unto, tho in the mean time they think that which is exacted of them to
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:48501:211"/>be Unreaſonable and Unjuſt. And as it concerns both the Wiſdom and Juſtice of <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers</hi> to be very tender in ordaining <hi>Oaths</hi> that are to be taken by <hi>Subjects,</hi> and that not only from a care that they may not proſtitute the Name of <hi>God</hi> to Prophanation, when the matter about which they are impoſed, is either light and trivial, or dubious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; but becauſe it is an Exerciſe of Juriſdiction over the Souls of Men, which is more than if it were only exerciſed over their <hi>Goods, Bodies</hi> and <hi>Privileges;</hi> ſo never any of our Kings pretended to a Right of enjoyning and requiring an <hi>Oath</hi> that was not firſt <hi>enacted</hi> and ſpecified in ſome <hi>Law;</hi> and it would have been heretofore accounted a good Plea for refuſing ſuch or ſuch an <hi>Oath,</hi> to ſay there was no Statute that had required it. It was one of the Articles of High Treaſon (and the moſt material) charged upon the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> that being <hi>Lord Deputy of Ireland,</hi> he required an <hi>Oath</hi> of the <hi>Scots</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited there, which no Law had ordained or preſcribed; which may make thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors who have adviſed the King to impoſe this new Oath, as well as all others that ſhall require it to be taken upon his Majeſty's bare Authority, to be a little apprehenſive, whether it may not at ſome time riſe in Judgment againſt them, and prove a Forfeiture of their Lives to Juſtice. And as the impoſing an Oath not warranted by <hi>Law,</hi> is an high <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> and in the King an altering of the Conſtitution; ſo if we look into the <hi>Oath</hi> it ſelf, we ſhall find this <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> ſtrangely manifeſted and diſplayed in all the Parts and Branches of it, and the People required to Swear themſelves his Majeſty's moſt obedient <hi>Slaves</hi> and <hi>Vaſſals.</hi> By one <hi>Paragraph</hi> of it, they are required to <hi>Swear that it is unlawful for Subjects, on any pretence, or for any Cauſe whatſoever, to riſe in Arms againſt him, or any Commiſſioned by him; and that they ſhall never reſiſt his Power or Authority;</hi> which as it may be intended for a Foundation and means of keeping Men quiet when he ſhall break in upon their <hi>Eſtates,</hi> and overthrow their <hi>Religion,</hi> ſo it may be deſigned as an Encouragement to his <hi>Catholick Subjects,</hi> to ſet upon the Cutting <hi>Proteſtants Throats,</hi> when by this <hi>Oath</hi> their Hands are tied up from hindering them. It is but for the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to come <hi>Authoriſed</hi> with his <hi>Majeſty's Commiſſion,</hi> which will not be denied them for ſo meritorious a Work, and then there is no Help nor Remedy, but we muſt ſtretch out our Necks, and open our Breaſts, to their Conſecrated Swords, and Sanctified Daggers. Nay, if the King ſhould transfer the Succeſſion to the Crown from the <hi>Rightful Heir,</hi> to ſome zealous <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſt,</hi> or <hi>Alienat,</hi> and diſpoſe of his <hi>Kingdoms</hi> in way of <hi>Donation</hi> and <hi>Gift</hi> to the <hi>Pope,</hi> or to the <hi>Society</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> and for the better ſecuring them in the Poſſeſſion hereafter, ſhould inveſt and place them in the Enjoyment of them while he lives; the <hi>Scots</hi> are bound, in the virtue of this <hi>Oath,</hi> tamely to look on, and calmly to acquieſce in it. Or ſhould his <hi>Phyſicians</hi> adviſe him to a nightly Variety of <hi>Matrons</hi> and <hi>Maids,</hi> as the beſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt his malignant and venomous Heats; all of that <hi>Kingdom</hi> are bound to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render their <hi>Wives</hi> and <hi>Daughters</hi> to him, with a dutiful Silence and a profound Veneration. And if by this <hi>Oath</hi> he can ſecure himſelf from the Oppoſition of his <hi>Diſſenting Subjects,</hi> in caſe through recovery of their Reaſon, a Fit of ancient Zeal ſhould ſurprize them; he is otherways ſecured of an <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Tameneſs in his Prelatical People, by a Principle which they have lately imbib'd, but neither learned from their Bibles, nor the Statutes of the Land. For the <hi>Clergy,</hi> upon thinking that the Wind would always blow out of one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and being reſolved to make that a Duty by their Learning, which their Intereſt at that ſeaſon made convenient; have preached up the <hi>Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience</hi> to ſuch a boundleſs height, that they have done what in them lyes, to give up themſelves and all that had the Weakneſs to believe them, fettered and bound for <hi>Sacrifices</hi> to <hi>Popiſh Rage</hi> and <hi>Deſpotical Tyranny.</hi> But for my ſelf (and I hope the like of many others.) I thank God I am not tainted with that ſlaviſh and adulatory Doctrine, as having always thought that the firſt Duty of every Member of a <hi>Body Politick,</hi> is to the <hi>Community,</hi> for whoſe Safety, and Good, <hi>Governors</hi> are inſtituted, and that it is only to <hi>Rulers,</hi> as they are found to anſwer the main <hi>Ends</hi> they are appointed for, and to Act by the legal Rules that are <hi>Chalk'd</hi> out unto them. Whether it be from my Dullneſs, or that my Underſtanding is of a perverſer make than other Mens, I cannot tell; but I could never yet be otherways minded, than that the <hi>Rules</hi> of the <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> and the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Republick</hi> or <hi>Kingdom,</hi> are to be the Meaſures both of the <hi>Sovereign's Commands,</hi> and of the <hi>Subjects Obedience;</hi> and that as we are not to invade what by <hi>Conceſſions</hi> and <hi>Stipulations</hi> belongs unto the <hi>Ruler;</hi> ſo we may not only Lawfully, but we ought to defend what is reſerved to our ſelves, if it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded and broken in upon. And as without ſuch a Right in the <hi>Subjects,</hi> all <hi>legal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and <hi>mix'd Monarchies,</hi> were but empty Names, and ridiculous things; ſo where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of a <hi>Nation</hi> is ſuch, there the <hi>Prince,</hi> who ſtrives to ſubvert the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Society,</hi> is the Traytor and Rebel; and not the People who endeavor to preſerve and defend them. There is yet another Branch of the foreſaid <hi>Oath,</hi> that is of a much more unreaſonable Strain than the former, which is, <hi>That they ſhall, to the utmoſt of their Power, aſſiſt, defend and maintain him in the Exerciſe of this Abſolute Power and Authority;</hi>
               <pb n="402" facs="tcp:48501:212"/>which being tack'd <hi>to our Obeying without reſerve,</hi> make us the greateſt <hi>Slaves</hi> that eithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Our <hi>Kings</hi> were heretofore bound to Govern accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Law (and ſo is his preſent <hi>Majeſty,</hi> if a <hi>Coronation Oath</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> to <hi>Hereticks,</hi> were not weaker than <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s cords proved to be) but inſtead of that, here is a new <hi>Oath</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon the Subjects, by which they are bound to protect and defend the <hi>King</hi> in his <hi>ruling Arbitrarily.</hi> It had been more than enough to have required only a calm ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the exerciſe of <hi>Abſolute Power;</hi> but to be enjoined to ſwear to <hi>aſſiſt</hi> and <hi>defend</hi> his <hi>Majeſty</hi> and <hi>Succeſſors</hi> in all things wherein they ſhall exert it, is a plain deſtroying of all <hi>natural</hi> as well as <hi>civil Liberty,</hi> and a robbing us of that freedom that belongs unto us, both as we are men, and as we are born under a free and legal Government. For by this we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come bound to drag our Brethren to the Stake, to cut their Throats, plunder their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, imbrew our hands in the Blood of our Wives and Children, if his <hi>Majeſty</hi> pleaſe to make theſe the Inſtances wherein he will exert his <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> and require us to <hi>aſſiſt him in the exerciſe of it.</hi> As it was neceſſary to <hi>cancel</hi> all other <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Teſts,</hi> as being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly inconſiſtent with this; ſo the requiring the <hi>Scots</hi> to ſwear this <hi>Oath,</hi> is the higheſt revenge he could take for their <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> and for all other <hi>Oaths,</hi> that luſt after <hi>Arbitrarineſs</hi> and <hi>Popiſh Bigottry,</hi> will pronounce to have been injurious to the Crown. But no words are ſufficient to expreſs the miſchiefs wrapt up in that new <hi>Oath,</hi> or to declare the abhorrency that all who value the <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> of Mankind ought to entertain for it, nor to proclaim the Villany of thoſe who ſhall by <hi>Addreſſes</hi> give thanks for the <hi>Proclamation.</hi> There may a <hi>fourth</hi> thing be added, whereby it will appear, that his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s aſſuming <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> ſtands recorded in Capital Letters in his <hi>Declaration</hi> for <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>Conſcience.</hi> For not being contented to omit the requiring the <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy</hi> and the <hi>Teſt Oaths</hi> to be taken, nor being ſatisfied to ſuſpend for a ſeaſon the enjoining any to be demanded to take them; he tells us that it is his <hi>Royal will and pleaſure</hi> that the aforeſaid <hi>Oaths ſhall not at any time hereafter be required to be taken,</hi> which is a full and direct <hi>Repealing</hi> of the Laws in which they are Enacted. It hath hitherto paſſed for an undoubted Maxim, that <hi>eorum eſt tollere, quorum eſt condere, they can only abrogate Laws, who have Power and Authority to make them;</hi> and we have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been made believe, that the <hi>Legiſlative power</hi> was not in the King alone, but that the two <hi>Houſes</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> had at leaſt a ſhare in it; whereas here by the diſabling and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpending Laws for ever, the whole <hi>Legiſlative Power</hi> is challenged to be veſted in the <hi>King,</hi> and at one daſh the Government of <hi>England</hi> is Subverted and changed. Tho it hath been much diſputed whether the <hi>King</hi> had a liberty of refuſing to <hi>Aſſent</hi> to <hi>Bills</hi> relating to the benefit of the Publick that had paſſed the two <hi>Houſes;</hi> and if there be any ſenſe in thoſe words of the <hi>Coronation Oath</hi> of his being bound to <hi>Govern according to the Laws quas vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus Elegerit,</hi> he had not; yet none till now, that his Majeſty doth it, had the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to affirm that he might <hi>abrogate Laws</hi> without the concurrence and aſſent of the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons.</hi> For to ſay that Oaths enjoined by Laws to be required to be taken, <hi>ſhall not at any time hereafter be required to be taken,</hi> is a plain Cancelling and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing of theſe Laws, or nothing of this World ever was or is; nor can the wiſdom of the Nation in Parliament Aſſembled, find words more <hi>emphatical</hi> to declare their <hi>Abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> without ſaying ſo, which at this time it was neceſſary to forbear, for fear of allarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kingdon too far, before his Majeſty be ſufficiently provided againſt it. For admitting them to continue ſtill in being and force, tho the King may promiſe for the <hi>non execution</hi> of them, during his own time, (which is even a pretty bold undertaking) yet he cannot aſſure us that the <hi>Oaths ſhall not be required to be taken at any time hereafter,</hi> unleſs he have provided for an eternal <hi>Line</hi> of <hi>Popiſh Succeſſors,</hi> which God will not be ſo unmerciful as to plague us with, or have gotten a Leaſe of a longer Life than <hi>Methuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi>'s, which is much more than the full <hi>Century</hi> of years wiſhed him in a late <hi>Dedication,</hi> by one that ſtiles himſelf an <hi>Iriſhman,</hi> a thing he might have forborn telling us, becauſe the Size of his Underſtanding fully declares it. However here is ſuch a ſtroke and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of <hi>Abſolute power,</hi> as Diſſolves the Government, and brings us all into a State of Nature, by diſcharging us from the ties, which by virtue of <hi>Fundamental Stipulations</hi> and <hi>Statute Laws</hi> we formerly lay under; foraſmuch as we know no <hi>King</hi> but a <hi>King</hi> by <hi>Law,</hi> nor no <hi>Power</hi> he hath but a <hi>legal Power.</hi> Which through diſclaiming by a challenge that the whole Legiſlative Authority does reſide in himſelf, he hath thrown the Gantler to three <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> and provokes them to a tryal, whether he be ableſt to maintain his <hi>Abſoluteneſs,</hi> or they to juſtifie their being a <hi>free People.</hi> And by virtue of the ſame <hi>Royal will and pleaſure,</hi> that he annuls (which he calls ſuſpending) the Laws enjoyning the <hi>Teſts</hi> and the <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and commands that none of theſe Oaths and Declarations <hi>ſhall at any time hereafter be required to be taken;</hi> he may in ſome following Royal Papers give us <hi>White-hall</hi> or <hi>Hampton Court</hi> Edicts, conformable to thoſe at <hi>Verfailles,</hi> which at all times hereafter we ſhall be bound to ſubmit unto, and ſtand obliged to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:48501:212"/>by inſtead of the <hi>Common Law</hi> and <hi>Statute Book.</hi> Nor is the taking upon him to ſtamp us new <hi>Laws,</hi> excluſively of <hi>Parliamentary</hi> concurrence, in the virtue of his <hi>Royal Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> any thing more uncouth in it ſelf, or more diſagreeable to the <hi>Rules</hi> of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi> and what we have been conſtantly accuſtomed unto, than the <hi>caſſing, diſabling</hi> and abrogating ſo many old ones, which that <hi>obſolete,</hi> out of date, as well as ill favoured thing upon <hi>Monarchs,</hi> called a <hi>Parliament,</hi> had a ſhare in the enacting of. I will not ſay that our <hi>Addreſſers</hi> were conſcious, that the getting an <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> in his <hi>Majeſty.</hi> to be owned and acknowledged, was one of the <hi>Ends</hi> for which the late <hi>Declaration</hi> was calculated and emitted, but I think I have ſufficiently demonſtrated both that <hi>ſuch</hi> a power it iſſueth and flows from, and that <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>power</hi> is plainly <hi>exerciſed</hi> in it. Which whether their coming now to be told and made acquainted with it, may make them repent what they have done, or at leaſt prevent their being acceſſory to the ſupport of this <hi>Power</hi> in other miſchievous effects that are to be dreaded from it, I muſt leave to time to make the diſcovery, it being impoſſible to foretell what a People fallen into a <hi>phrenzie</hi> may do in their <hi>paroxiſms</hi> of diſtraction and madneſs.</p>
            <p>Nor was the <hi>ſcruing himſelf</hi> into the poſſeſſion of an <hi>Abſolute power,</hi> and the getting it to be owned by at leaſt a part of the people, the only <hi>Motive</hi> to the publiſhing the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration for Liberty of Conſcience</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Proclamation for a Toleration in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> but a <hi>ſecond inducement,</hi> that ſway'd unto it, was the undermining and ſubvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and the opening a door for the <hi>introduction</hi> and <hi>eſtabliſhment</hi> of <hi>Popery.</hi> Nor was it from any compaſſion to <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> that theſe <hi>two Royal Papers</hi> were emitted, but from his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s tender love to <hi>Papiſts,</hi> to whom as there ariſe many advantages for the preſent, ſo the whole benefit will be found to redound to them in the iſſue. We are told (as I have already mentioned) <hi>that the King is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to convert England, or to die a Martyr;</hi> and we may be ſure that if he did not think the <hi>ſuſpending</hi> the <hi>penal Laws,</hi> and the <hi>diſpenſing</hi> with requiring of the <hi>Teſts,</hi> and the granting <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Toleration,</hi> to be means admirably adapted thereunto, he would not have acted ſo inconſiſtently with himſelf, nor in that oppoſition to his own <hi>deſigns,</hi> as to have diſabled theſe <hi>Laws,</hi> and vouchſafed the Freedom that reſults thereupon. Eſpecially when we are told by the <hi>Liege Jeſuit,</hi> that the King being <hi>ſenſible of his grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing old,</hi> finds <hi>himſelf</hi> thereby obliged <hi>to make the greater haſte, and to take the larger ſteps,</hi> leſt through not living long enough to effect what he intends, he ſhould not only loſe the glory of <hi>converting</hi> three Kingdoms, but <hi>ſhould leave the Papiſts in a worſe condition than he found them.</hi> His <hi>Highneſs</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> very juſtly concludes this to be the thing aim'd at by the preſent <hi>Indulgence,</hi> and therefore being deſired to approve the <hi>Suſpenſion</hi> of the <hi>Teſt Acts,</hi> and to co-operate with <hi>his Majeſty</hi> for the obtaining their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Repealed;</hi> was pleaſed to anſwer, <hi>That while he was, as well as profeſſeth himſelf, a Proteſtant,</hi> he would <hi>not act ſo unworthily as to betray the Proteſtant Religion,</hi> which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily muſt, if he ſhould do as he was deſired. Her <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi> the <hi>Princeſs</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> has likewiſe the ſame apprehenſion of the tendency of the <hi>Toleration</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,</hi> and therefore was pleaſed to ſay to ſome <hi>Scots Miniſters</hi> that did themſelves the honor, and performed the duty that became them, in going to wait upon <hi>her,</hi> that <hi>ſhe</hi> greatly commended <hi>their</hi> having <hi>no acceſſion to the betraying of the Proteſtant Religion, by their returning home to take the benefit of the Toleration.</hi> What an indelible Reproach will it be to a company of men, that pretend to <hi>be ſet for the defence of the Goſpel,</hi> and who ſtile themſelves <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to be found betraying <hi>Religion,</hi> thro juſtifying the <hi>Suſpenſion</hi> of ſo many <hi>Laws</hi> whereby it was <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> and <hi>ſupported,</hi> and whereby the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> were <hi>fenced</hi> about, and guarded againſt <hi>Popery;</hi> while theſe <hi>two</hi> noble <hi>Princes</hi> to the neglect of <hi>their</hi> own Intereſt in His <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Favour, and to the provoking <hi>him</hi> to do <hi>them</hi> all the prejudice he can in their <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Succeſſion</hi> to the <hi>Imperial Crown</hi> of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> do ſignifie their open diſlike of that <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> and that not only upon the account of its Illegality and Arbitrarineſs, but by reaſon of its tendency to ſupplant and undermine the <hi>Reformed Religion.</hi> And they are ſtrangely blind that do not ſee how it powerfully operates, and conduceth to the effecting of this, and that in more ways and methods than are eaſie to be recounted. For thereby our <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions</hi> are not only kept up at a time, when the united Counſels and ſtrength of all <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> is too little againſt the craft and power of <hi>Rome;</hi> but they who have <hi>Addreſſed</hi> to thank the <hi>King</hi> for his <hi>Royal Papers,</hi> and become a liſted and enrolled <hi>Faction,</hi> to abet and ſtand by the <hi>King</hi> in all that naturally follows to be done for the maintaining his <hi>Declaration,</hi> and juſtifying of the uſurped <hi>Authority</hi> from which it iſſues. 'Tis matter of a melancholy conſideration, and turns little to the credit of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> that when they of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who had with ſo great indiſcretion promoted things to that paſs, which an eaſie improvement of would produce what hath ſince enſued, are through being at laſt enlightned in the deſigns of the <hi>Court,</hi> come ſo far to recover
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:48501:213"/>their wits, as that they can no longer do the ſervice they were wont, and which was ſtill expected from them; there ſhould be a new <hi>Tribe</hi> of men muſter'd up to ſtand in their room, and who by their <hi>Vows</hi> and <hi>Promiſes</hi> made to the <hi>King</hi> in their <hi>Addreſſes,</hi> have undertaken to perform, what others have the Conſcience and Honeſty, as well as the Wiſdom to refuſe and decline. Nor are the <hi>Diviſions</hi> among <hi>Proteſtants</hi> only here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by upheld and maintained; but our Animoſities and Rancors are both continued and enflamed. For while they of the <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> way are provoked and exaſperated to ſee all the <hi>legal</hi> Foundations both of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> and their <hi>Church</hi> ſubverted; the <hi>Addreſſing Diſſenters</hi> are emboldned to revenge themſelves upon the National Clergy, in terms of the utmoſt Opproory, Virulence, and Reproach, for their acceſſion to the Sufferings which they had endured. Surely it would have been not only more <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,</hi> but much more <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> to have made no other Retaliations but thoſe of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs and pardon for the injuries they had met with, and to have offered all the aſſiſtances they could give, to their <hi>conformable Brethren,</hi> for the ſtemming and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the <hi>deluge</hi> of Popery and Tyranny that is impetuouſly breaking in upon the <hi>Kingdoms.</hi> And as this would have united all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in bonds of forbearance and love not to be diſſolved through petty differences about Diſcipline, Forms of Worſhip, and a few Rites and Ceremonies; ſo it would in the ſenſe and judgment of all men, have given them a more triumphant Victory over thoſe that had been their imprudent and peeviſh Enemies, than if they were to enjoy the ſpoils of the <hi>conformable Clergy,</hi> by being put into poſſeſſion of their <hi>Cures</hi> and <hi>Benefices.</hi> The Relation I have ſtood in to the <hi>Diſſenting</hi> Party, and the Kindneſs I retain for them above all other, make me hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily bewail their loſing the happieſt opportunity that ever was put into their hands, not only of improving the compaſſion, which their calamities had raiſed for them in the hearts of the generality, into friendſhip and kindneſs, but of acquiring ſuch a merit upon the <hi>Nation,</hi> that the utmoſt favours which a true <hi>Engliſh Proteſtant Parliament</hi> could hereafter have ſhewed them, would have been accounted but ſlender as well as juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences. Nor can I forbear to ſay, that I had rather have ſeen the <hi>Furnace</hi> of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions made hotter for them, though it ſhould have been my own lot to be thrown into the moſt ſcorching flames, than to have beheld them guilty of thoſe exceſſes of folly towards themſelves, and of treachery to <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Laws</hi> of their <hi>Country,</hi> which their preſent eaſe, and a ſhort opportunity afforded them of acquiring gain, have hurried and tranſported ſo many of them into. It plainly appears with what aſpect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our <hi>Religion</hi> the <hi>Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience</hi> was emitted, if we do but obſerve the advantages the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have already reap'd by it. How is the whole Nation thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not only overflow'd with ſwarms of <hi>Locuſts,</hi> and all places filled with <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,</hi> but the whole <hi>executive Power</hi> of the <hi>Government,</hi> and all preferments of Honor, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and Profit, are put into <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> hands? So that we are not only expoſed to the unwearied and reſtleſs importunities of <hi>Seducers,</hi> but thro the advancement of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> to all Offices <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Military,</hi> if not <hi>Eccleſiaſtick;</hi> the <hi>covetous</hi> become brib'd, the timorous threatned, and the profane are baited with temptations ſutable to their luſts, and they that ſtand reſolved to continue honeſt are laid open not only to the bold af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts of <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Friers,</hi> the inſolencies of petulant <hi>Popiſh Juſtices,</hi> the chicaneries and oppreſſions of the <hi>Arbitrary Commiſſion Court,</hi> but to the rage of his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and the danger of being attack'd by his armed <hi>Squadrons.</hi> To which may be added, that by the ſame <hi>Prerogative</hi> and <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> that his <hi>Majeſty</hi> hath ſuſpended the <hi>Laws</hi> made for the <hi>Protection</hi> of our <hi>Religion;</hi> he may diſable and diſpenſe with all the <hi>Laws</hi> by which it is ſet up and eſtabliſhed. And as it will not be more <hi>illegal</hi> and <hi>arbitrary</hi> to make void the <hi>Laws</hi> for <hi>Proteſtancy,</hi> than to have ſuſpended thoſe againſt <hi>Popery;</hi> ſo I do not ſee how the <hi>Addreſſers</hi> that have approved the <hi>one,</hi> can diſallow or condemn the <hi>other.</hi> For the <hi>King</hi> having obtained an acknowledgment of his <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> and of his <hi>Royal Prerogative</hi> paramount to <hi>Laws</hi> on his exerciſing it in one inſtance; it now depends merely upon his own will (for any thing theſe thankſgiving Gentlemen have to ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it) whether he may not exert it in another, wherein they are not likely to find ſo much of their eaſe and gain.</p>
            <p>There is a <hi>third Inducement</hi> to the emitting thoſe Royal Papers, which tho at the firſt view it may ſeem wholly to regard <hi>Foreigners,</hi> yet it ultimately terminates in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of our <hi>Religion</hi> at home, and in the <hi>King</hi>'s putting himſelf into a condition of exerciſing his <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> in whatſoever Acts he pleaſeth over his own <hi>Subjects,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after the <hi>French</hi> faſhion in commanding them to turn <hi>Catholicks</hi> becauſe he will have it ſo, or after the manner of the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> to require them to ſubmit their <hi>Necks</hi> to the <hi>Bow-ſtring;</hi> becauſe he is jealous of them, or wants their Eſtates to pay his <hi>Janizaries.</hi> The <hi>United Provinces</hi> are they whom he bore a particular ſpleen and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation unto, when he was a <hi>Subject,</hi> and upon whom he is now in the <hi>Throne,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:48501:213"/>not only to wreak all his old Malice, but by <hi>Conquering</hi> and <hi>Subduing</hi> them (if he can) to ſtrengthen his <hi>Abſoluteneſs</hi> over his own People, and to pave his way for over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> without lying open to the Hazards that may otherways attend and enſue upon the attempting of it. And inſtead of expecting nothing from him, but what may become a brave and generous Enemy, they ought to remember the Encouragement that he gave heretofore to two Varlets, to burn that part of their <hi>Fleet</hi> which belong'd to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> an Action as Ignominious as Fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and that might have been <hi>Fatal</hi> to all the Provinces, if, through a happy and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Detection, and the Apprehenſion of one of the Miſcreants, it had not been prevented. He knows that the <hi>States General</hi> are not only zealous Aſſertors of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, but always ready to afford a <hi>Sanctuary</hi> and a place of <hi>Refuge</hi> to thoſe, who being oppreſſed for the Profeſſion of it elſewhere, are forced to forſake their own <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> and to ſeek for Shelter and Relief in other Parts. And as he is not unſenſible, how eaſie the Withdrawment and Flight is into theſe Provinces, for ſuch as are Perſecuted in his Dominions; ſo he is aware, that if Multitudes, and eſpecially Men of Condition and Eſtates, ſhould, for the avoiding his Cruelty, betake themſelves thither, that they would not be unthoughtful of all Ways and Means, whereby they might Redeem their <hi>Country</hi> from <hi>Tyranny,</hi> and reſtore themſelves to the quiet Enjoyment of their <hi>Eſtates</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> at home. But that which moſt Enrages him, is the <hi>Figure</hi> which the two Princes do make in that <hi>State</hi> (of whoſe Succeſſion to the Crown the Proteſtants in <hi>Britain</hi> have ſo near a Proſpect) and the Poſt which the Prince filleth in that Government, ſo that he dare neither venture to <hi>Diſinherit Them,</hi> nor impoſe upon them ſuch <hi>Terms</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,</hi> as their Conſciences will not ſuffer them to comply with, while either theſe <hi>States</hi> remain Free, or while ſuch <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> as retain a Zeal for <hi>Religion</hi> and the Ancient <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Rights</hi> of their reſpective <hi>Countries,</hi> can retreat thither under hopes of Admiſſion and Protection. And ſo cloſely are the <hi>Intereſts</hi> of all Proteſtants in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> woven and inlaid with the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the <hi>United Netherlands,</hi> and ſuch is the ſingular regard that both the one and the other bear to the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> the <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> and their ſeveral <hi>Civil Rights;</hi> that it is impoſſible for his <hi>Majeſty</hi> to embark in a Deſign againſt the <hi>One,</hi> without reſolving at the ſame time upon the Ruin of the <hi>Other.</hi> Neither will the <hi>One</hi> be able to <hi>ſubſiſt,</hi> when once the <hi>Other</hi> is <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued</hi> and <hi>Enſlaved.</hi> As <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſaw no way ſo compendious for the reſtoring himſelf to the Sovereignty and Tyrannous Rule over the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as the <hi>Subjugating</hi> of <hi>England</hi> that help'd to ſupport and aſſiſt them, which was the ground of Rigging out his Formidable <hi>Armado,</hi> and of his deſign againſt <hi>England</hi> in 1588, ſo his <hi>Britiſh Majeſty</hi> thinks no Method ſo Expeditious for the Enſlaving his own People, as the endeavoring firſt to <hi>ſubdue</hi> the <hi>Dutch.</hi> And as upon the one hand it would be of a threatning Conſequence to <hi>Holland,</hi> could the King ſubjugate his own People, extirpate the Proteſtant Religion out of his Dominions, and advance himſelf to a Deſpotical Power; ſo upon the other hand, could he conquer the <hi>Dutch,</hi> we might with the greateſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty <hi>Date</hi> the woful <hi>Fate</hi> of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and the loſs of all that is valuable to them as Men and Chriſtians, from the ſame Moment and Period of time. They are like the <hi>Twins</hi> we read of, whoſe <hi>Deſtiny</hi> was, to live and die together; and which ſoever of the <hi>two</hi> is deſtroyed firſt, all the Hope and Comfort that the other can pretend unto, is to be laſt devoured. Now after the Advances which his <hi>Majeſty</hi> had made towards the Enſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his <hi>Subjects,</hi> and the <hi>Subverting</hi> the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> in his <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> he finds it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, before he venture to give the laſt and fatal Stroke at home, and to enter upon the plenary Exerciſe of his <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> in laying <hi>Parliaments</hi> wholly aſide, in can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling all <hi>Laws</hi> to make way for <hi>Royal Edicts</hi> or <hi>Declarations</hi> of the Complexion of the former, and in commanding us to turn <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> or to be <hi>Dragoon'd;</hi> I ſay he thinks it needful, before he proceeds to theſe, to try whether he can <hi>Subdue</hi> and <hi>Conquer</hi> the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and thereby remove all hopes of Shelter, Relief, Comfort and Aſſiſtance from his own People, when he ſhall afterwards fall upon them. And how much ſoever the Court endeavors to conceal its Deſign, and ſtrives to complement the <hi>States General</hi> into a Confidence that all <hi>Alliances</hi> between them and the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> ſhall be maintained and preſerved; yet they not only ſpeak their Intentions by ſeveral open and viſible Actions, but ſome of them cannot forbear to tell it, when their Blood is heated, and their Heads warm'd with a liberal Glaſs and a luſty Proportion of Wine. Thence it was that a <hi>Governing Papiſt</hi> lately told a Gentleman, after they two had drank hard together, <hi>That they had ſome Work in</hi> England <hi>that would employ them a little time, but when that was over, they would make the Dutch fly to the end of the World to find a reſting place.

For as <hi>Monſieur Barrillion</hi> and <hi>Monſieur Bonrepos</hi> preſent Tranſactions at <hi>Whitehall</hi> relate to ſomething elſe than merely to the affair of <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s <hi>Bay;</hi> ſo Prince <hi>George</hi>'s er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand to <hi>Denmark,</hi> is of more importance than a bare Viſit, or a naked Compelment to his Brother. 'Tis upon this deſign that all that great <hi>Marine</hi> Preparation hath been ſo long making in the ſeveral Ports of <hi>England;</hi> but to the hindering the execution whereof ſome unexpected and not foreſeen accidents have interpoſed. And it is in ſubſerviency not to be diſquieted at Home, while he is carrying on this holy War Abroad, that the <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Liberty of Conſcience in England, and the Proclamation for a Toleration in Scotland,</hi> are granted and publiſhed. 'Tis well enough known, how that after the <hi>French King,</hi> had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many other ſeverities exerciſed againſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> made them uncapable of Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Commands; yet to avoid the conſequences that might have enſued thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, while he was engaged in a War againſt the <hi>Emperor,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> and to have the aid of his <hi>Reformed Subjects;</hi> he not only intermitted and aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in many other rigours towards them, but in <hi>Anno</hi> 1674, reſtored them to a capacity of being employed and preferred. And that this did not flow from any compaſſion, tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or good will towards them, his carriage ſince the iſſue of that War, and the miſerable condition he hath reduced them to, does ſufficiently teſtifie and declare. Nor can we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, how that the <hi>late King,</hi> after a rigorous execution of the <hi>penal laws</hi> for ſeveral years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> yet being to enter into an unjuſt War againſt the <hi>United Provinces Anno</hi> 1672. not only forbore all proceedings of that kind, but publiſhed a <hi>Declaration</hi> for ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Execution of all thoſe <hi>Laws,</hi> and for the allowing them liberty of Aſſembling to worſhip God in their ſeparate Meetings, without being hindred or diſturbed. What Principle that proceeded from, and to what End it was calculated, appeared in his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to them afterwards, when neither the danger the Nation was in from the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> nor the application of ſeveral <hi>Parliaments,</hi> could prevail for lonity towards them, much leſs for a <hi>legal Repeal</hi> of thoſe implitick and unreaſonable Statutes. Nor does the preſent <hi>Indulgence</hi> flow from any kindneſs to <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> but it is only an artifice to ſtifle their Diſcontents, and to procure their aſſiſtance for the deſtroying of a <hi>Foreign Proteſtant State.</hi> And it may not be unworthy of obſervation, that as the <hi>Declaration</hi> of <hi>Indulgence Anno</hi> 1672, bore date much about the ſame time with the <hi>Declaration</hi> of War againſt the <hi>Dutch;</hi> ſo at the very Seaſon that his preſent <hi>Majeſty</hi> emitted his <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> there were <hi>Commiſſions</hi> of <hi>Repriſal</hi> prepared and ready to be granted to the <hi>Engliſh Eaſt-India Company</hi> againſt the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> but which were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed upon the Court's finding that they whom the ſuſpending the Execution of ſo many Laws, and the granting ſuch Liberties, Rights and Immunities to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> had diſguſted and provoked, were far more numerous, and their reſentments more to be apprehended, than they were, whoſe murmurings and diſcontents they had ſilenced and allay'd by the <hi>liberty</hi> that was granted. Now as it will be at this juncture, when the <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt</hi> is ſo low in the World, and the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> in ſo great danger of being Deſtroyed, a moſt wicked as well as an imprudent Act, to contribute help and aid to the Subjugating a People that are the chief <hi>Protectors of the Proteſtant Religion</hi> that are left; and almoſt the only <hi>Aſſerters</hi> of the <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> ſo it may fill the <hi>Addreſſers</hi> with confuſion and ſhame, that they ſhould have not only juſtified an Act of His <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s that is plainly deſigned to ſuch a miſchievous End, but that they ſhould by the Promiſes and Vows that they have made Him, have emboldned His <hi>Majeſty</hi> to continue his purpoſes and reſolutions of a War againſt the <hi>Dutch.</hi> Which as it muſt be funeſtous and fatal to the <hi>Proteſtant Cauſe,</hi> in caſe he ſhould proſper and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; ſo howſoever it ſhould iſſue, yet the <hi>Addreſſers,</hi> who have done what in them lyes to give encouragement unto it, will be held betrayers of the Proteſtant Religion, both abroad and at home, and judged guilty of all the Blood of thoſe of the ſame Faith with them, that ſhall be ſhed in this Quarrel.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Liberty</hi> ought to be allowed to men in matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> is no <hi>Plea</hi> whereby the <hi>King</hi>'s giving it in an <hi>illegal</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary</hi> manner, can be maintained and juſtified. Since ever I was capable of exerciſing any diſtinct and coherent acts of Reaſon, I have been always of that mind, that none ought to be perſecuted for their Conſciences towards God in matters of Faith and Worſhip. Nor is it one of thoſe things that lye under the power of the <hi>Sovereign</hi> and <hi>Legiſlative Authority,</hi> to grant or not to grant; but it is a Right ſetled upon Mankind antecedent to all <hi>Civil Conſtitutions</hi> and <hi>Humane Laws,</hi> having its foundation in the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> which no <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>State</hi> can legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:48501:214"/>violate and Infringe. The <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> as a <hi>Civil Officer,</hi> can pretend or claim no Power over a People, but what he either derives from the <hi>Divine Charter;</hi> wherein <hi>God,</hi> the Supreme <hi>Inſtitutor</hi> of <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> has chalk'd out the Duty of Rulers in general, or what the People, upon the firſt and original <hi>Stipulation,</hi> are ſuppoſed to have given him in order to the Protection, Peace and Proſperity of the <hi>Society.</hi> But as it does no where appear, that God hath given any ſuch Power to Governors, ſeeing all the <hi>Revelations</hi> in the Scripture, as well as all the <hi>Dictates</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> ſpeak a contrary Language, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the People, upon their chuſing ſuch a one to be their <hi>Ruler,</hi> be imagined to transfer and veſt ſuch a Power in him, foraſmuch as they cannot diveſt themſelves of a Power, no more than of a Right, of believing things, as they arrive with a Credibility to their ſeveral and reſpective Underſtandings. As it is in no Man's Power to believe as he will, but only as he ſees cauſe; ſo it is the moſt irrational Imagination in the World, to think they ſhould transfer a <hi>Right</hi> to him whom they have choſen to govern them, of puniſhing them for what it is not in their power to help. Nor can any thing be plainer, than that God has reſerved the <hi>Empire</hi> over <hi>Conſcience</hi> to himſelf, and that he hath circumſcribed the Power of all Humane Governors to things of a civil and inferior Nature. And had God convey'd a <hi>Right</hi> unto <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> of commanding Men to be of this or that <hi>Religion,</hi> and that becauſe they are ſo, and will have others to be of their mind; it would follow that the People may conform to whatſoever they require, tho by all the Lights of Senſe, Reaſon and Revelation, they are convinced of the Falſhood of it: Seeing whatſoever the <hi>Sovereign rightfully Commands,</hi> the <hi>Subjects</hi> may <hi>lawfully obey.</hi> But tho the perſecuting People, <hi>for Matters of mere Religion,</hi> be repugnant to the Light of Nature, inconſiſtent with the Fundamental Maxims of Reaſon, directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Temper and Genious, as well as to the Rules of the Goſpel, and not only againſt the Safety and Intereſt of <hi>Civil Societies,</hi> but of a Tendency to fill them with Confuſion, and to arm <hi>Subjects</hi> to the cutting of one anothers Throats; yet Governors may both deny <hi>Liberty</hi> to thoſe whoſe Principles oblige them to deſtroy thoſe that are not of their mind, and may in ſome meaſure <hi>Regulate</hi> the <hi>Liberty</hi> which they vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to others, whoſe Opinions, tho they do not think dangerous to the Peace of the <hi>Community,</hi> yet through judging them Erroneous and Falſe, they conceive them dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the Souls of Men. As there is a vaſt difference betwixt <hi>Tolerating</hi> a <hi>Religion,</hi> and approving the <hi>Religion</hi> that is <hi>Tolerated;</hi> ſo what a <hi>Government</hi> doth not approve, but barely permits and ſuffers, may be brought under Reſtrictions as to time, place and number of thoſe profeſſing it, that ſhall aſſemble in one Meeting; which it were an Undecency to extend to thoſe of the juſtified and eſtabliſhed way. Now whatſoever <hi>Reſtrictions</hi> or <hi>Regulations</hi> are enacted, and ordained by the <hi>Legiſlative Authority,</hi> in reference to <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions</hi> or <hi>Religious Aſſemblies,</hi> they are not to be ſtop'd, diſabled or ſuſpended, but by the ſame Authority that enacted and ordained them. The King ſays very truly, <hi>That Conſcience ought not to be conſtrained, nor People forced in matters of mere Religion:</hi> But it does not from thence follow, (unleſs by the Logick of <hi>Whitehall</hi>) that without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of a Parliament, he ſhould ſuſpend and diſpenſe with the <hi>Laws,</hi> and by a pretended Prerogative, relieve any from what they are Obnoxious unto by the <hi>Statutes</hi> of the <hi>Realm.</hi> His ſaying that the forcing People in matters of Religion, <hi>ſpoils Trade, depopulates Countries, diſcourageth Strangers, and anſwers not the End of bringing all to an Uniformity, for which it is employ'd;</hi> would do well in a <hi>Speech</hi> to the <hi>Houſes</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> to perſwade them to <hi>Repeal</hi> ſome certain <hi>Laws;</hi> or might do well to determine his <hi>Majeſty</hi> to aſſent to ſuch Bills as a Parliament may prepare and offer, for relieving Perſons in matters of Conſcience; but does not ſerve for what it is alledged, nor can it warrant his ſuſpending the <hi>Laws</hi> by his ſingle Authority. And by the way, I know when theſe very Arguments were not only deſpiſed by his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and rediculed by thoſe who took their <hi>Cue</hi> from Court, and had Wit to do it, as by the preſent Biſhop of <hi>Oxford,</hi> in a very ill-natur'd Book, called <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Polity;</hi> but when the daring to have mentioned them, would have provok'd the then Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Indignation, and have expoſed the Party that did it, to Diſcountenance and Diſgrace. The Queſtion is not, what is convenient to be done in ſome meaſure and degree, and in reference to thoſe whoſe Religion does not oblige them to deſtroy all that differ from them, when they have opportunity for it; but the Point in debate is, who hath the legal Power of doing it, and of fixing its Bounds and Limits. It was never pretended that the King ought to be ſhut out from a Share in <hi>Suſpending</hi> and <hi>Repealing Laws;</hi> but that the ſole <hi>Right</hi> of doing it belongs to him, is what cannot be allowed, without changing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and placing the whole <hi>Legiſlative Authority</hi> in His <hi>Majeſty.</hi> And as it is an <hi>Uſurpation</hi> in the King to challenge it, and a <hi>Treachery</hi> in <hi>Engliſh Subjects</hi> to acknowledge it; ſo the Inconveniences that this or that Party are in the mean time expoſed unto, through the <hi>Laws</hi> remaining in Force, are rather to be endured, than that a Power of
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:48501:215"/>giving Eaſe and Relief (farther than by Connivance) ſhould be confeſſed to reſide in any <hi>one,</hi> in whom the <hi>Laws</hi> of the Community have not placed it. 'Tis better to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo Hardſhips under the Execution of unjuſt <hi>Laws;</hi> than be releaſed from our <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> by a Power Uſurped over all <hi>Laws.</hi> For by the <hi>one,</hi> the <hi>Meaſures</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> as well as the Rights and Privileges of a <hi>Nation,</hi> are deſtroy'd; whereas by the other, only a part of the People are Afflicted and unduly dealt with. While we are govern'd by <hi>Laws,</hi> tho ſeveral of them may be Injuſt and Inconvenient, yet we are under a Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as to all other things which thoſe Laws have not made liable; but when we fall under an illimited <hi>Prerogative</hi> and <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> we have no longer a <hi>Title</hi> unto, or a hedge about any thing, but all lies open to the Luſt and Pleaſure of him, in whom we have owned that Power to be ſeated. A <hi>Liberty</hi> is what <hi>Diſſenters</hi> have a <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>Claim,</hi> and which the <hi>Legiſlative Authority</hi> is bound by the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Duty,</hi> as well as by <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Diſcretion</hi> to grant. And I am ſorry, that while they ſtood ſo fair to obtain it in a <hi>Legal</hi> and <hi>Parliamentary</hi> way, any of them by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging a <hi>Right</hi> in another to give it, and that in a manner ſo <hi>Subverſive</hi> of the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> ſhould have rendred themſelves unworthy to receive it from them, to whom the Power of <hi>Beſtowing</hi> it does belong. Not but that a <hi>Toleration</hi> will be always due to their Principles, but I know not whether the particular Men of thoſe Principles, who have, by their <hi>Addreſſes,</hi> betray'd the Kingdom, may not come to be judged to have forfeited all Share in it, for their Crime committed againſt the Conſtitution, and the whole Politick Society. Nor is there any thing more Juſt and Equal, than that they who ſurrender and give away the <hi>Rights</hi> both of <hi>Legiſlators</hi> and <hi>Subjects;</hi> ſhould loſe all Grace and Favor from the former, and all Portion among the latter.</p>
            <p>And how much ſoever ſome Proteſtant Diſſenters, may pleaſe themſelves with the Liberty, that at preſent they enjoy in the virtue of the two <hi>Royal Papers;</hi> yet this may ſerve to moderate them in their Tranſports of Gladneſs, that they have no ſolid Security for the Continuance of it. For ſhould a <hi>Parliament null</hi> and make <hi>void</hi> the <hi>Declaration for Liberty,</hi> and <hi>impeach</hi> the <hi>Judges</hi> for declaring a Power veſted in the King to ſuſpend ſo many <hi>Laws,</hi> and for forbearing upon the <hi>King's Mandat</hi> to execute them; the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> poſſeſs, would immediately vaniſh, and have much the ſame Deſtiny that the <hi>Liberty</hi> had, which was granted unto them by the <hi>Declaration</hi> of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, Anno</hi> 1672. Or ſhould the <hi>Parliament</hi> be willing to grant Eaſe and Indulgence to all Proteſtants, by a <hi>Bill</hi> prepared for <hi>Repealing</hi> of all the <hi>Laws</hi> formerly made againſt them, and ſhould only be deſirous to preſerve in force the <hi>Laws</hi> relating to the <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and the <hi>Statutes</hi> which enjoyn the <hi>Teſts,</hi> of whoſe Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we never more wanted the Benefit, in order to our Preſervation from Popery, and which an <hi>Engliſh Parliament</hi> cannot be ſuppoſed willing to part with, at a time when our Lives, Eſtates and Religion, are ſo viſibly threatned to be ſwallowed up, and deſtroyed by the Papiſts: In that caſe we may confidently believe, that the <hi>King,</hi> inſtead either of <hi>Aſſenting</hi> to ſuch a <hi>Bill</hi> for ſeparate Favor to Proteſtants, or perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering in his Compaſſion and Kindneſs of continuing the <hi>Suſpenſion</hi> of the Laws againſt <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> he would from an inveterate Enmity, as well as from a new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted Reſentment, be ſtirred up and enraged to the putting the <hi>Laws</hi> in Execution with greater Rigor and Severity than hath been ſeen or felt heretofore. And all that the <hi>Addreſſers</hi> would then reap by the <hi>Declaration,</hi> would be to undergo the furious Effects of Brutal Rage in their Perſecutors, and to be unpitied by the Kingdom, and unlamented by their fellow Proteſtants. Or ſhould his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> in favor to his good <hi>Catholicks,</hi> reſolve againſt the Meeting of a <hi>Parliament,</hi> or to Adjourn and Prorogue them whenſoever he ſhall find, that inſtead of <hi>confirming</hi> what he hath done, they ſhall make null his <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> vote his pretended Prerogative <hi>Illegal</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> and fall upon thoſe Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and Perjured <hi>Villains,</hi> who have allowed him a Power tranſcendent to <hi>Law;</hi> yet even upon that Suppoſal, which is the beſt that can be made, to ſupport Mens hopes in the continuance of the preſent <hi>Liberty,</hi> the <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> would have but ſlender Security; all the Tenure they have for the Duration of their <hi>Freedom,</hi> being only Preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and depending merely upon the <hi>King's Word</hi> and <hi>Promiſe,</hi> which there is ſmall ground to rely upon. Nor can He be true to them, without being falſe to his <hi>Religion,</hi> which not only gives Him leave to <hi>break</hi> his <hi>Faith with Hereticks,</hi> but obligeth Him to it, and to deſtroy them to boot, and that both under the pain of Damnation, and of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting his <hi>Crown</hi> and loſing his <hi>Dominions.</hi> And how far the <hi>Promiſe</hi> and <hi>Royal Word</hi> of a <hi>Catholick Monarch</hi> is to be truſted unto, and depended upon, we have a modern Proof and Evidence in the Behavior of <hi>Louis de Grand</hi> towards his <hi>Reformed Subjects,</hi> not only in Repealing the many <hi>Edicts</hi> made and confirmed by himſelf, as well as his Anceſtors, for the free Exerciſe of their Religion; but in the Methods he hath always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:48501:215"/>namely to promiſe them protection in the profeſſion of their Faith, and practice of their Worſhip, when he was moſt ſtedfaſtly reſolved to ſubvert their <hi>Religion,</hi> and was about making ſome freſh advance, and taking ſome new ſtep for its Extirpation. Thus when he had firmly purpoſed, not to ſuffer a <hi>Miniſter</hi> to continue a <hi>year</hi> in the Kingdom, he at the ſame time publiſhed an <hi>Edict,</hi> requiring Miniſters, to ſerve but three Years in one Place, and not to return to the Church where they had firſt <hi>Officiated,</hi> till after the expiration of <hi>twenty Years.</hi> In the ſame manner, when he had reſolved, to Repeal the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> and had given injunction for the <hi>Draught,</hi> by which it was to be done, he at the ſame ſeaſon, gave the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> all aſſurances of Protection, and of the ſaid <hi>Edicts</hi> being kept Inviolable. To which may be added, that ſhameful and deteſtable <hi>Chicanery,</hi> in paſſing his Sacred and Royal Word, that no <hi>violence</hi> ſhould be offered any for their <hi>Religion,</hi> tho at that very moment, the <hi>Dragoons</hi> were upon their March; with orders of exerciſing all manner of Cruelties und Barbarities, upon them. So that his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> hath a Pattern lately ſent him, and that by the Illuſtrious <hi>Monarch,</hi> whom he ſo much admires, and whom he makes it his Ambition, and Glory, to imitate. Nor are we without proofs already, how inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Promiſes</hi> are, (except to delude) and what little confidence ought to be put in them. The diſabling and ſuſpending the 13th. <hi>Statute</hi> of his <hi>late Parliament</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> wherein the <hi>Teſt</hi> was Confirmed, and his departing from all his Promiſes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred in his <hi>Letter,</hi> as well as from thoſe contained in the <hi>Speech</hi> made by the <hi>Lord Commiſſioner,</hi> purſuant to the Inſtructions which he had undoubtedly receiv'd, together with his having forgotten and receded from all his Promiſes made to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> both when Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and ſince he came to the Crown, are undeniable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, that his <hi>Royal Word,</hi> is no more Sacred, nor Binding, than that of ſome other Monarchs; and that whoſoever of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſhall be ſo fooliſh, as to rely upon it, will find themſelves as certainly diſappointed, and deceived, as they of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> elſewhere, have been. And while they of the <hi>Eſtabliſhed</hi> way, find ſo ſmall ſecurity by the Laws, which the <hi>King</hi> is bound by his <hi>Coronation Oath,</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> cannot expect very much, from a naked <hi>Promiſe,</hi> which as it hath not a ſolemn <hi>Oath</hi> to enforce it, ſo 'tis both Illegal in the making, and contrary to the <hi>principles</hi> of his <hi>Religion</hi> to keep. Nor is it unworthy of obſervation, that he hath not only departed from his Promiſes made to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> but that we are told, in a late <hi>Popiſh Pamphlet,</hi> Intituled <hi>A New Teſt of the Church of England</hi>'s <hi>Loyalty,</hi> Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed (as it ſelf ſays) <hi>by Authority,</hi> that they were all <hi>conditional,</hi> (to wit, by vertue of ſome Mental Reſervation in his Majeſty's Breaſt) and that the <hi>Conformable Clergy</hi> having failed in performing the Conditions, upon which they were made; the <hi>King,</hi> is abſolved, and diſcharged, from all Obligation, of obſerving them. The <hi>Church of England</hi> (ſays he) <hi>muſt give his Majeſty leave not to nouriſh a Snake in his Boſom, but rather to withdraw his Royal Protection, which was promiſed, upon the account of her conſtant fidelity.</hi> Which as it is a plain threatning of all the <hi>Legal Clergy,</hi> and a denunciation of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and hard meaſure, they are to look for; ſo it ſhakes the Foundation, upon which all credit unto, and reliance upon, his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Word, can be any ways placed. For tho <hi>Threatnings</hi> may have <hi>tacit Reſerves,</hi> becauſe the right of executing them, reſides in the <hi>Threatner;</hi> yet <hi>Promiſes</hi> are incapable of all <hi>latent conditions,</hi> becauſe every Promiſe veſts a Right in the <hi>Promiſee,</hi> and that in the virtue of the words in which it is made. But it is the leſs to be wondred at, if his Majeſty fly to <hi>Equivocations</hi> and <hi>Mental Reſerves,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both under the conduct of that <hi>Order,</hi> and a <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Society,</hi> that firſt taught and practiſed this treacherous piece of <hi>Chicanery.</hi> However it may inform the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> that if they be not able to anſwer the End, for which they are depended upon; or be not willing in the manner and degree, that is expected; or if it be not for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Catholick Cauſe, to have them indulged; in all theſe caſes, and many more, the King may be pronounced, acquitted, and diſcharged from all the Promiſes, he hath given them, as having been merely ſtipulatory, and conditional. And as he will be ſure then, <hi>finem facere ferendae alienae perſonae, to lay aſide the diſguiſe that he hath now put on;</hi> ſo if they would reflect either upon his temper, or upon his Religion, they might now know, <hi>haud gratuitam in tanta ſuperbia comitatem, that a perſon of his pride would not ſtoop to ſuch Flattery,</hi> (as his Letter to Mr. <hi>Alſop</hi> expreſſeth) <hi>but in order to ſome deſign.</hi> But what need other proof of the fallaciouſneſs of the two <hi>Royal Papers,</hi> and that no <hi>Proteſtants</hi> can reaſonably depend upon the <hi>Royal Word,</hi> there laid to pledge for the continuation of their Liberty; but to look into theſe too <hi>Papers</hi> themſelves, where we ſhall meet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, that may both detract from our belief of his Majeſty's ſincerity, and awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken us to a juſt jealouſie, that the Liberty, and Toleration, granted by them, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be of no long ſtanding and duration. For while he is pleaſed to tell us, <hi>that the granting his Subjects the free uſe of their Religion for the time to come, is an addition to the

And as the <hi>End</hi> unto which that <hi>Inquiſition-Court</hi> was inſtituted, was to rob us of our Rights and Privileges at the mere Pleaſure of the <hi>King;</hi> ſo the very <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of it, is an <hi>Invaſion</hi> both upon all our <hi>Laws,</hi> and upon the whole Property of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and is one of the higheſt Exerciſes of Deſpotical Power, that it is poſſible for the moſt Abſolute and unlimited <hi>Monarch</hi> to exert.

We may ſubjoyn to the <hi>Clauſe</hi> already mentioned, that other <hi>Expreſſion,</hi> which occurs in the foreſaid <hi>Declaration, viz.</hi> That <hi>as he freely gives them leave to meet and ſerve God after their own way and manner, ſo they are to take ſpecial care, that nothing be preached or taught amongſt them, which may any ways tend to alienate the Hearts of the People from his Majeſty, or his Government:</hi> Which words as they import the Price at which the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are to purchaſe their Freedom (whereof we ſhall diſcourſe anon) ſo they admirably ſerve to furniſh the <hi>King</hi> with a Pretence of retrenching their Liberty whenſoever he pleaſeth, nor are they inferted there for any other End, but that upon a Plea, of their having abuſed his <hi>Gracious Indulgence, to the alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating the Hearts of his People from him,</hi> they may be adjudged to have thereby deſervedly forfeited, both all the Benefits of it, and of his <hi>Royal Favor.</hi> Nor is it poſſible for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Miniſter to preach one Sermon, which a Popiſh Critick, or a Romiſh Bigot, may not eaſily miſconſtrue and pervert, <hi>to be an Alienation of the Peoples Hearts, from the King's Perſon and Government.</hi> And of which as we have heard many late Examples in <hi>France,</hi> ſo it will be eaſie to draw them into Preſident, and to imitate them in <hi>England.</hi> I might add the Obſervation of the ingenious <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Reflections on his Majeſty's Proclamation for a Toleration in</hi> Scotland: Namely, that whereas the King gives all Aſſurance to his <hi>Scots
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:48501:216"/>Subjects,</hi> that he will <hi>not uſe invincible Neceſſity</hi> againſt any Man, on the account of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, he does thereby leave himſelf at a liberty of <hi>Dragooning, Torturing, Burning,</hi> and doing the utmoſt Violences, all theſe being vincible to a Perſon of an ardent love to God, and of a lively Faith in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and which accordingly many Thouſands have been triumphantly Victorious over. Nor is it likely that this new and uncouth Phraſe of <hi>not uſing an invinſible Neceſſity,</hi> would have found room in a Paper of that nature, if it had not been firſt to conceal ſome malicious and miſchievous Deſign, and then to juſtifie the Conſiſtency of its Execution, with what is promiſed in the <hi>Proclamation.</hi> Moreover, were there that Security intended by theſe two <hi>Royal Papers,</hi> that <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> might ſafely rely upon; or did the King act with that Sincerity which he would delude his People into a Belief of, there would then be a greater Agreeableneſs than there is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Declaration</hi> for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience in England,</hi> and the <hi>Proclamation for a Toleration in Scotland.</hi> The Principle his <hi>Majeſty</hi> pretends to act from, <hi>That Conſcience ought not to be conſtrained, and that none ought to be perſecuted for mere matters of Religion,</hi> would oblige him to act uniformly, and with an equal extention of Favor to all his <hi>Subjects,</hi> whoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are the ſame, and againſt whom he hath no Exception, but in matters merely Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. Whereas the Diſparity of Grace, Kindneſs and Freedom, that is exerciſed in the <hi>Declaration,</hi> from that which is exerted in the <hi>Proclamation,</hi> plainly ſhews, that the whole is but a <hi>Trick</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> and done in Subſerviency to an end, which it is not yet ſeaſonable to diſcover and avow. For his circumſcribing the <hi>Toleration</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to ſuch <hi>Presbyterians</hi> as he ſtiles Moderate, is not only a taking it off from its true Bottom, <hi>matters of mere Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and a founding it upon an <hi>internal Quality</hi> of the mind, that is not diſſernable, but it implies the reſerving a Liberty to himſelf, of withdrawing the Benefits of it from all <hi>Scots Diſſenters,</hi> through faſtening upon them a contrary <hi>Character,</hi> whenſoever it ſhall be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to revive Perſecution. And even as it is now exerted to theſe <hi>Moderate ones,</hi> it is attended with <hi>Reſtrictions,</hi> that his <hi>Indulgence</hi> in <hi>England</hi> is no ways clog'd with. All that the <hi>Declaration</hi> requires from thoſe that are indulged, is, <hi>That their Aſſemblies be peaceably, openly and publickly held, that all Perſons be freely admitted to them, that they ſignifie and make known to ſome Juſtice of the Peace, what places they ſet apart for theſe uſes; and that nothing be preached or taught amongſt them, which may any ways tend to alionate the Hearts of the People from the King or his Government:</hi> Whereas the <hi>Proclamation</hi> not only reſtrains the <hi>Meetings</hi> of the <hi>Scots Presbyterians to private Houſes,</hi> without allowing them either to build <hi>Meeting-Houſes,</hi> or to uſe Out-houſes or Barns; but it prohibits <hi>the hearing any Miniſters,</hi> ſave ſuch as ſhall be willing to ſwear, <hi>That they ſhall, to the utmoſt of their power, aſſiſt, defend and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the King, in the Exerciſe of his Abſolute Power againſt all deadly.</hi> Nor is it difficult to aſſign the reaſon of the Deformity that appears in his <hi>Majeſty's</hi> preſent Actings towards his <hi>Diſſenting Proteſtant Subjects</hi> in thoſe <hi>two Kingdoms.</hi> For ſhould there be no Reſtriction upon the <hi>Toleration</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to hinder the greateſt part of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> from taking the Advantage of it; the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Conforming Clergy</hi> would be immediately forſaken by the generality if not all the People, and ſo an iſſue would not only be put to the <hi>Diviſion</hi> among <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in that Kingdom, but they would become an united, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a formidable Body againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> which it is not for the Intereſt of the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi> to ſuffer, or give way unto. Whereas the more unbounded the <hi>Liberty</hi> is, that is granted to <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> the more are our <hi>Diviſions</hi> not only kept up, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and promoted, (eſpecially through this Freedom's arriving with them in an illegal way, without both the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Legiſlative Power,</hi> and the Approbation of a great part of the People) it being infallibly certain, that there is a vaſt number of all Ranks and Conditions, who do prefer the abiding in the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> before the joyning in Fellowſhip with thoſe of the <hi>Separate</hi> and <hi>Diſſenting Societies.</hi> Upon the whole, this different Method of proceeding towards <hi>Diſſenting Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Matters mere Religious,</hi> ſhews that all this <hi>Indulgence</hi> and <hi>Toleration,</hi> is a <hi>Trick</hi> to ſerve a preſent juncture of Affairs, and to advance a <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Deſign;</hi> and that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> have no Security for the continuance of their <hi>Liberty,</hi> but that when the Court and <hi>Jeſuitick</hi> end is compaſſed and obtained, there is another courſe to be ſteered towards them; and inſtead of their hearing any longer of <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Toleration,</hi> they are to be told, that it is the Intereſt of the <hi>Government,</hi> and the <hi>Safety</hi> and <hi>Honor</hi> of his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi> to have but <hi>one Religion</hi> in his <hi>Dominions,</hi> and that all muſt be <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and this becauſe the King will have it ſo, which is the <hi>Argument</hi> that hath been made uſe of in the making ſo many <hi>Converts</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> They who now ſuffer themſelves to be deluded into a Confidence in the Royal Word, will not only come to underſtand what Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> meant, in his telling <hi>Pere de la Chaiſe,</hi> that the <hi>Catholicks in</hi> England <hi>had a great work upon their hand, being about the Extirpation of that Hereſie, which hath borne ſway ſo long in this Northern part of the World;</hi> but they will alſo ſee and feel, how much of the Deſigns of <hi>Rome</hi> was repreſented in that paſſage of
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:48501:217"/>the <hi>Pope's Nuncio's Letter</hi> dated at <hi>Bruſſels Aug.</hi> 9. 1674. wherein upon the Confidence which they placed in the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> which is not leſſened ſince he came to the Crown, he takes the confidence to write, <hi>That they hoped ſpeedily to ſee the total and final Ruin of the Proteſtant Party.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> have no Security by the <hi>Declaration</hi> and <hi>Proclamation</hi> for the continuance of their <hi>Liberty,</hi> ſo they that have, by way of Thankſgiving, <hi>Addreſſed</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> for thoſe <hi>Royal Papers,</hi> have not only acted very ill, in reference both to the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> and of <hi>Religion</hi> in general, but they have carried very unwiſely in relation to their own Intereſt, and the avoiding the Effects of that Reſentment, which moſt Men are juſtly poſſeſſed with, upon the illegal Emiſſion of theſe <hi>Arbitrary</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative Papers.</hi> I ſhall not enter upon any long Diſcourſe, concerning this new Practice of <hi>Addreſſing</hi> in general, it having been done elſewhere ſome years ago, but I ſhall only briefly intimate, that it was never in faſhion, unleſs either under a weak and precarious Government, or under one that took <hi>illegal Courſes,</hi> and purſued a <hi>different Intereſt</hi> from that of the People and Community. As he who <hi>Ruleth</hi> according to the ſtanding <hi>Laws</hi> of a <hi>Country,</hi> over which he is ſet, needs not ſeek for an Approbation of his Actions from a part of his <hi>Subjects;</hi> the <hi>Legality</hi> of his Proceedings being the beſt <hi>Juſtification</hi> of him that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, and giving the trueſt <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to them that are <hi>Ruled;</hi> ſo he who enjoys the love of all his People, needs not look for Promiſes of being aſſiſted, ſtood by and defended, by any one Party or Faction among them; there being none from whom he can have the leaſt Apprehenſion of Oppoſition and Danger. It was the want of a <hi>legal Title</hi> in <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Cromwel,</hi> and his Son <hi>Richard,</hi> to the <hi>Government,</hi> that firſt begot this Device of <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing,</hi> and brought it upon the Stage in theſe <hi>Britiſh Nations;</hi> and it was the <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Procedures of the <hi>late King,</hi> as it is of his <hi>preſent Majeſty,</hi> and their acting upon a <hi>diſtinct Bottom</hi> from that of the Three <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> that hath revived, and does continue it. Nor is there any thing that hath rendered thoſe two <hi>Princes</hi> more contemptible abroad, and proclaimed them Weaker at home, than their recurring unto, and ſolliciting, the Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and Aid of the Mercenary, Timorous, Servile, and for low and perſonal Ends byaſs'd part of their <hi>Subjects,</hi> and thereby telling the World, that neither the Generality nor the moſt Honorable of their People, have been united in their Intereſt, nor Approvers of the Counſels that have been taken and purſued. And if any thing did ever caſt a Diſhonor upon the <hi>Engliſh Nation,</hi> it hath been that loathſome Flattery, and ſlaviſh Sycophancy, wherewith the <hi>Addreſſers,</hi> both now, and for ſome years paſt, have ſtuffed their Applications to the two <hi>Royal Brothers.</hi> The <hi>Throne</hi> that is ſuſtained and upheld by the <hi>Pillars</hi> of <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> needs not to hew out unto its ſelf other <hi>Supporters,</hi> nor lean upon the crooked and weak Stilts of the inſignificant, and for the moſt part deceitful, as well as brib'd Vows, of a ſort of Men, who will be as ready upon the leaſt diſguſt, to cry <hi>Crucifie</hi> to morrow, as they were for being gratified, may be in their Luſts, Humors and Revenges, and at the beſt in ſome ſeparate Concern, to cry <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to day. I ſhall decline proſecuting what concerns the Honor or Diſhonor of him, to whom the <hi>Addreſſes</hi> are made, or how Politick, or Impolitick, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing and Encouraging them is, and ſhall apply my ſelf to this new <hi>Sett</hi> of <hi>Addreſſers,</hi> and endeavor to ſhew how Fooliſh as well as Criminally they have acted. Nor is it an Argument either of their Prudence or Honeſty, or of their acting with any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency to themſelves, that having ſo ſeverely inveighed againſt the <hi>Addreſſes</hi> that were in faſhion a few years ago, and having faſtened all the Imputations and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches upon thoſe that were Acceſſary to them, which that Rank of <hi>Addreſſers</hi> could be ſuppoſed to have deſerved; they now eſpouſe the Practice which they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and in reference to as <hi>Arbitrary</hi> and unjuſtifiable an <hi>Act</hi> of His preſent <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi> as the moſt illegal one the late King was guilty of, or the worſt Exerciſe or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, for which any heretofore either commended, or promiſed to ſtand by him. For tho the Matter and Subject of the <hi>Arbitrary Act of him</hi> now upon the <hi>Throne,</hi> be not, as to every Branch of it, ſo publickly Scandalous, as ſome of the <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the late King were, (as relating to a Favor which Mankind hath a juſt Claim unto) yet it is every way as Illegal, being in reference to a Privilege, which his <hi>Majeſty</hi> hath no <hi>Authority</hi> to grant and beſtow. And were it not that there are many <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> who preſerve themſelves Innocent at this Juncture, and upon whom the Temptation that is adminiſtred makes no Impreſſion; the World would have juſt ground to ſay, that the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> are not governed by Principles, but that the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures they walk by, are what conduceth to their private and perſonal Benefit, or what lyes in a Tendency to their Loſs and Prejudice. And that it was not the late King's Uſurping and exerting an <hi>Arbitrary</hi> and illegal Power that offended them, but that they were not the <hi>Objects</hi> in whoſe Favor it was exerciſed. 'Tis alſo an Aggravation of their <hi>Folly;</hi> as well as their <hi>Offence,</hi> that they ſhould revive a Practice which the Nation
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:48501:217"/>was grown aſham'd of, and whereof they who had been guilty begun to repent, through having ſeen that all the former <hi>Declarations, Aſſurances</hi> and <hi>Promiſes</hi> of the <hi>Royal Brothers,</hi> which tempted to Applications of that kind, were but ſo many Juggles, peculiar to the late <hi>Breed</hi> of the Family, for the deceiving of Mankind; and that never one of them was performed and made good. But the Tranſgreſſion, as well as the Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, of the preſent <hi>Addreſſers,</hi> is yet the greater, and they are the more Criminal and Inexcuſable before God and Men, in that they might have enjoyed all the Benefits of the <hi>King's Declaration,</hi> without acknowledging the Juſtice of the <hi>Authority</hi> by which it was granted, or making themſelves the Scorn and Contempt of all that are truly Honeſt and Wiſe, by their ſervile Adulations, and their Gratulatory Scriblers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> They had no more to do, but to continue their <hi>Meetings,</hi> as they had ſometimes heretofore uſed to do, without taking notice that the preſent <hi>Suſpenſion</hi> of the <hi>Laws,</hi> made their Aſſembling together more ſafe, and freed them from Apprehenſions of Fines and Impriſonments. Nor could the King, how much ſoever diſpleaſed with ſuch a Conduct, have at this time ventured upon the expreſſing Diſpleaſure againſt them; ſeeing as that would have been both to have proclaimed his Hypocriſie, in ſaying, <hi>That Conſcience ought not to be conſtrained, nor People forced in matters of mere Religion,</hi> and a diſcovering the villainous Deſign, in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviency to which the <hi>Declaration</hi> had been emitted; ſo it were not poſſible for him, after what he hath publiſhed, to ſingle out the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> from amongſt other <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants;</hi> and to fall upon all, before Matters are more ripe for it, might be a means of the Abortion of all his Popiſh Projections, and of ſaving the whole <hi>Reformed</hi> Intereſt in <hi>Great Britain.</hi> Neither would the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England-men</hi> have envied their Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, or have blamed their Carriage; but would have been glad that their <hi>Brethren</hi> had been eaſed from Oppreſſions, and themſelves delivered from the grievous and diſhonorable Task of proſecuting them, which they had formerly been forced unto by <hi>Court-Injunctions</hi> and <hi>Commands.</hi> And as they would have, by a Conduct of this Nature, had all the Freedom which they now enjoy, without the Guilt and Reproach which they have derived upon themſelves by <hi>Addreſſing;</hi> ſo ſuch a <hi>Carriage</hi> would have wonderfully recommended them to the Favor of a true Engliſh Parliament, which tho it would ſee cauſe to condemn the King's Uſurping a Power of <hi>Suſpending</hi> the <hi>Laws,</hi> and to make void his <hi>Declaration;</hi> yet in gratitude to <hi>Diſſenters</hi> for ſuch a Behavior, as well as in Pity and Compaſſion to them as Engliſh Proteſtants, ſuch a Parliament would not fail to do all it could, to give them relief in a legal way. Whereas if any thing Enflame and Exaſperate the Nation, to revive their Sufferings, it will ariſe from a Reſentment of the unworthy and treacherous Carriage of ſo many of them, in this critical and dangerous Juncture. But the <hi>Terms,</hi> which through their <hi>Addreſſing,</hi> they have owned the receiving their <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Indulgence</hi> upon, does in a peculiar manner enhance their Guilt againſt God and their Country, and ſtrangely adds to the Diſguſt and Anger, which Lovers of <hi>Religion,</hi> and the Laws of the Nation have conceived againſt them. For it is not only upon the Acknowledgment of a Prerogative in the King over the <hi>Laws,</hi> that they have received, and now hold their <hi>Liberty;</hi> but it is upon the <hi>Condition, That nothing be preached or taught amongſt them, that may any ways tend to alienate the Hearts of the People from his Majeſty's Perſon and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> He muſt be of an Underſtanding very near allied unto, and approaching to that of an <hi>Iriſh-man,</hi> who does not know what the <hi>Court-Senſe</hi> of that Clauſe is; and that his <hi>Majeſty</hi> thereby intends, that they are not to preach againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> nor to ſet forth the Doctrines of the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> in <hi>Terms</hi> that may prevent the Peoples being infected by them, much leſs in Colours that may render them Hated and Abhorred. To accuſe the <hi>King's Religion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> or to affirm the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the <hi>Apocalyptick Babylon,</hi> and to repreſent the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Tridentine Faith,</hi> as Faithful <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ought to do, would be accounted an <hi>alienating</hi> the <hi>Hearts</hi> of their <hi>Hearers</hi> from the King and his <hi>Government;</hi> which as they are in the foreſaid <hi>Clauſes</hi> required not to do, ſo they have, by their <hi>Addreſſing,</hi> confeſſed the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of the <hi>Terms,</hi> and have undertaken to hold their <hi>Liberty</hi> by that <hi>Tenor.</hi> And to give them their due, they have been very Faithful hitherto, in conforming to what the King Exacts, and in obſerving what themſelves have aſſented to the Equity of. For notwithſtanding all the Danger from Popery, that the <hi>Nation</hi> is expoſed unto, and all the Hazard that the <hi>Souls</hi> of Men are in, of being poyſoned with <hi>Romiſh Principles;</hi> yet inſtead of <hi>Preaching</hi> or <hi>Writing</hi> againſt any of the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> they have agreed among themſelves, and with ſuch of their Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations as approve their Procedure, not ſo much as to mention them; but to leave the <hi>Province</hi> of defending our <hi>Religion,</hi> and of detecting the Falſhood of <hi>Papal Tenets,</hi> to the Paſtors and Gentlemen of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And being ask'd (as I know ſome of them that have been) why they do not preach againſt <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and confute the <hi>Papal
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:48501:218"/>Dectrines;</hi> they very gravely reply, that by <hi>preaching Chriſt,</hi> they <hi>preach</hi> againſt <hi>Anti-chriſt;</hi> and that by <hi>Teaching</hi> the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> they <hi>refute Popery;</hi> which is ſuch a piece of fraudulent and guilful Subterfuge, that I want words to expreſs the knavery and criminalneſs of it. What a reſerve and change have I lived to ſee in <hi>England,</hi> from what I beheld a few years ago. It was but the other day that the <hi>Conformable Clergy</hi> were repreſented by ſome of the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> not only as favorers of <hi>Popery,</hi> but as endeavouring to hale it in upon us by all the methods and ways that lay within their circle; and yet now the whole <hi>defence</hi> of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> muſt be entirely devolved into their hands; and when all the <hi>ſluces</hi> are pulled up, that had been made to hinder <hi>Popery</hi> from overflowing the <hi>Nation,</hi> they muſt be left alone to ſtem the Inundation, and prevent the Deluge. They among the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> that boaſted to be the moſt avowed and irreconcileable Enemies of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> are not only become altogether ſilent, when they ſee the Kingdom peſter'd with a <hi>ſwarm</hi> of buſie and ſeducing <hi>Emiſſaries;</hi> but are both turned Advocates for that <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Paper,</hi> whereby we are ſurrendred as a Prey unto them, and do make it their buſineſs to detract from the reputation, and diſcourage the Labours of the <hi>National Miniſters,</hi> who with a <hi>zeal</hi> becoming their <hi>Office,</hi> and a Learning which deſerves to be admired, have ſet themſelves in oppoſition to that <hi>croaking fry,</hi> and have done enough by their excellent and unimitable Writings, to ſave People from being deluded, or perverted, if either unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able confutations of <hi>Popery,</hi> or demonſtrative <hi>defences</hi> of the <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> can have any efficacy upon the minds of Men. Among other fulſom Flatteries adorning a <hi>Speech</hi> made to his <hi>Majeſty</hi> by an <hi>Addreſſing Diſſenter,</hi> I find this hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical and ſhameful <hi>Adulation,</hi> namely, <hi>that if there ſholud remain any ſeeds of Diſloyalty in any of his Subjects, the tranſcendent goodneſs exerted in his Declaration, would mortifie and kill them.</hi> To which he might have added with more truth, that the ſame <hi>tranſcendent good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> had almoſt deſtroyed all the ſeeds of their honeſty, and mortified their care and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment for the Intereſt of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and for the <hi>Reformed Religion.</hi> Their old ſtrain of zealous Preaching againſt the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and concerning the <hi>coming out of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon my People,</hi> are grown out of faſhion with them in <hi>England,</hi> and are only reſerved, and laid by, to recommend them to the kindneſs and acceptation of Foreign <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> when their occaſions and conveniencies draw them over to <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> Whoever comes into their <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> would think, for any thing that he there hears delivered from their Pulpits, that <hi>She</hi> which was the <hi>Whore</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> a few years ago, were now become a <hi>Chaſt Spouſe;</hi> and that what were heretofore the damnable <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> were of late turned <hi>Innocent</hi> and <hi>Harmleſs Opinions.</hi> The <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Declaration</hi> would ſeem to have brought ſome of them to a <hi>melius inquirendum;</hi> and as they are already arrived to believe a <hi>Roman Catholick the beſt King,</hi> that they may in a little time come to eſteem <hi>Papiſts</hi> for the beſt <hi>Chriſtians. The keeping back nothing that is profitable to ſave ſuch as hear them, and the declaring the whole Counſel of God;</hi> that are the terms upon which they received their <hi>Commiſſion</hi> from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and wherein they have <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>practice</hi> and <hi>example</hi> for a <hi>pattern,</hi> would ſeem to be things under the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Royal Prerogative,</hi> and that the King may ſupercede them by the ſame Authority, by which he diſpenſes with the Penal <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</hi> Which as it is very agreeable unto, and imported in his <hi>Majeſty's Claim</hi> of being obeyed without <hi>reſerve;</hi> ſo the owning this <hi>Abſolute power</hi> with that annex of challenged <hi>obedience,</hi> does acquit them from all obligations to the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when they are found to interfer with what is required by the King. But whether God's <hi>Power</hi> or the <hi>King</hi>'s, be <hi>ſuperior,</hi> and which of the two can <hi>caſſate</hi> the others <hi>Laws,</hi> and whoſe wrath is moſt terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Judgment day will be able and ſure to inſtruct them, if all means in this World prove inſufficient for it. The <hi>Addreſſers</hi> know upon what <hi>conditions</hi> they hold their <hi>Liberty;</hi> and they have not only obſerved how ſeveral of the <hi>National Clergy</hi> have been treated for <hi>preaching</hi> againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> but they have heard how divers of the <hi>Reformed Miniſters</hi> in <hi>France</hi> (before the general Suppreſſion) were dealt with for ſpeaking againſt their <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch's Religion,</hi> and therefore they muſt be pardoned, if they carry ſo as not to provoke his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> tho in the mean time through their Silence, they both betray the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of their <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter,</hi> and are unfaithful to the <hi>Souls</hi> of thoſe, of whom they have taken upon them the Spiritual guidance. As for the <hi>Papers</hi> themſelves, that are ſtiled by the name of <hi>Addreſſes,</hi> I ſhall not meddle with them, being as to the greateſt part of them, fitter to be expoſed and <hi>ridicul'd,</hi> either for their dullneſs and <hi>pedantry,</hi> or for the Adulation and Sycophancy with which they are fulſomly ſtuft, than to deſerve any ſerious conſideration, or to merit Reflections that may prove inſtrumentive to Mankind. Only as that <hi>Addreſs</hi> wherein his <hi>Majeſty</hi> is thanked for his reſtoring <hi>God to his Empire over Conſcience,</hi> deſerveth a rebuke for its <hi>Blaſphemy;</hi> ſo that other which commends him for promiſing, <hi>to force the Parliament</hi> to ratifie his <hi>Declaration,</hi> (tho by the way all he ſays is, <hi>that he does not doubt of their concurrence,</hi> which yet his ill ſucceſs upon the <hi>Cloſetting</hi> of ſo many Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and his ſince Diſſolving that <hi>Parliament,</hi> ſhews that there was ſome cauſe for the
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:48501:218"/>doubting of it) I ſay that other <hi>Addreſs</hi> merits a ſevere Cenſure for its inſolency againſt the <hi>legiſlative Authority:</hi> And the <hi>Authors</hi> of it ought to be puniſhed for their crime com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt the <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Freedom</hi> of the <hi>two Houſes,</hi> and for encouraging the <hi>King</hi> to invade and ſubvert their moſt eſſential and fundamental <hi>Privileges,</hi> and without which, they can neither be a <hi>Council,</hi> Judicature, nor <hi>Lawgivers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After all, I hope the <hi>Nation</hi> will be ſo <hi>ingenuous,</hi> as not to impute the miſcarriages of ſome of the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> to the whole <hi>Party,</hi> much leſs to aſcribe them to the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Diſſenters.</hi> For as the <hi>points</hi> wherein they differ from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> are purely of another nature, and which have no relation to <hi>Politicks,</hi> ſo the influence that they are adapted to have upon men as members of <hi>Civil Societies,</hi> is to make them in a ſpecial manner regardful of the Rights and Franchiſes of the <hi>Community.</hi> But if ſome neither underſtand the tendency of their own <hi>Principles,</hi> nor are true and faithful unto them; theſe things are the perſonal faults of thoſe men, and are to be attributed to their ignorance, or to their diſhoneſty; nor are their <hi>Carriages</hi> to be counted the effects of their <hi>religious Tenets,</hi> much leſs are others of the Party to be involved under the reproach and guilt of their imprudent and ill conduct. Which there is the more cauſe to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, becauſe tho the <hi>Church of England</hi> has all the reaſon of the world, to decline <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing,</hi> in that all her <hi>legal Foundation,</hi> as well as <hi>Security,</hi> is ſhaken by the <hi>Declaration;</hi> yet there are ſome of her <hi>Dignitaries</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> as well as divers of the <hi>Members</hi> of her <hi>Communion,</hi> who upon motives of Ambition, Covetouſneſs, Fear, or Courtſhip, have enrolled themſelves into the <hi>Liſt</hi> of <hi>Addreſſers;</hi> and under pretence of giving thanks to the <hi>King</hi> for his promiſe of <hi>protecting the Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and Clergy, and all other of the Church of</hi> England <hi>in the free exerciſe of their Religion, as by Law eſtabliſhed;</hi> have cut the throat of their <hi>Mother,</hi> at whoſe breaſts they have ſuck'd till they are grown fat, both by acknowledging the <hi>uſurped Prerogative</hi> upon which the <hi>King</hi> aſſumes the <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of emitting the <hi>Declaration;</hi> and by exchanging the <hi>legal</hi> ſtanding and ſecurity of their <hi>Church,</hi> into that precarious <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>Royal Word,</hi> which they fly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to as the <hi>bottom</hi> of <hi>her Subſiſtence,</hi> and truſt to as the <hi>wall</hi> of <hi>her defence.</hi> And as moſt of the Members of the <hi>Separate Societies,</hi> are free from all acceſſion to <hi>Addreſſing,</hi> and the few that concurred were merely drawn in by the <hi>wheedle</hi> and importunity of their <hi>Preachers;</hi> ſo they who are of the chiefeſt <hi>Character,</hi> and greateſt reputation for Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Learning among the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> have preſerved themſelves from all folly and treachery of that kind. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us, <hi>that not many wiſe, not many noble are called;</hi> which as it is verified in many of the <hi>Diſſenting Addreſſers,</hi> ſo it may ſerve for ſome kind of <hi>Apology</hi> for their low and ſneaking, as well as for their indiſcreet and imprudent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour in this matter. And it is the more venial in ſome of them, as being not only a means of ingratiating themſelves (as they fanſie) with the <hi>King,</hi> who heretofore had no very good opinion of them; but as being both an eaſie and compendious method of <hi>Attoning</hi> for <hi>Offences</hi> againſt the <hi>Crown,</hi> of which they were ſtrongly ſuſpected; and a cheap and expenceleſs way of purchaſing the pardon of their Relations, that had ſtood actually <hi>accuſed</hi> of <hi>High Treaſon.</hi> Nor is it to be doubted, but that as the <hi>King</hi> will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain very little favour and mercy for <hi>Fanaticks</hi> when once he has ſerved his Ends upon them; ſo they will preſerve as little kindneſs for the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> if they can but obtain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in a legal way. And as there is not a People in the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that will be more <hi>loyal</hi> to <hi>Princes;</hi> while they continue ſo to govern as that Fealty by the Laws of God or Man remains due to them; ſo there are none, of what Principles or Communion ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, upon whom the <hi>Kingdom</hi> in its whole intereſt come to lye at ſtake, may more aſſuredly and with greater confidence depend, than upon the generality of <hi>Diſſenting Proteſtants,</hi> and eſpecially upon thoſe that are not of the <hi>Paſtoral Order.</hi> The ſeverities that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> lay under before, and their deliverance from Oppreſſion and Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance now, ſeconded with the <hi>Kings</hi> expectation and demands of thankſgiving <hi>Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> were ſtrong Temptations upon men void of generoſity and greatneſs of ſpirit, and who are withal of no great <hi>political</hi> Wiſdom, nor of proſpect into the Conſequences of Councils and Tricks of State, to act as illegally in their <hi>thanks,</hi> as his <hi>Majeſty</hi> had done in his <hi>bounty.</hi> So that whatſoever Animadverſion they may deſerve, ſhould they be proceeded againſt according to their demerit; yet it is to be hoped, that both <hi>they,</hi> and the <hi>Addreſſers</hi> of the former ſtamp, may all find room in an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Indemnity,</hi> and that the <hi>Mercy</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi> towards them, will triumph over and get the better of its <hi>Juſtice.</hi> As it would argue a ſtrange and judicial infatuation, ſhould they proceed to farther exceſſes, and think to eſcape the Puniſhment due to one Crime, by committing and taking ſanctuary in another, thro improving their Complements into actions of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery; ſo all their hope of Pardon, as well as of Lenity and Moderation, from a true <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and rightly conſtituted <hi>Authority,</hi> depends upon their conduct and behaviour henceforward, and their not ſuffering themſelves to be hurried and deluded into a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:48501:219"/>with the <hi>Court,</hi> for the obtaining of a <hi>Popiſh Parliament.</hi> All their endeavours of that kind would but more clearly detect, and manifeſt, their treachery to <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> it not being in their power to out-vote the honeſt Engliſh part of the People, ſo as to help the <hi>King</hi> to ſuch a <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> as he deſires; and were it poſſible, that thro their aſſiſtance, in conjunction with violence and tricks, uſed in Elections and Returns by the <hi>Court,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> might be obtained, as would be ſerviceable to <hi>Arbitrary</hi> and <hi>Papal</hi> Ends; yet neither the <hi>King</hi> nor they would be the nearer the compaſſing what is aim'd at; it being demonſtrable that the <hi>majority</hi> of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> are never to be wrought over to juſtifie this <hi>illegal Declaration;</hi> or to grant the <hi>King</hi> a <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Suſpending Laws</hi> at his pleaſure; nor to give their <hi>Aſſent</hi> to a <hi>Bill</hi> for <hi>Repealing</hi> the <hi>Test Acts,</hi> and the <hi>Statutes</hi> that enjoyn and require the <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy.</hi> And if they ſhould be ſo far left of God, and betray'd by thoſe among themſelves whom the <hi>Court</hi> hath gained, as to become guilty of ſo enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous an act of folly and villany; and ſhould the <hi>Election</hi> of the next <hi>Parliament, be the happy juncture they wait for,</hi> and the improving their intereſt, as well as the giving their own Votes for the Choice of <hi>Papiſts</hi> into the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> be what they mean <hi>by an eſſential proof of their Loyalty and of the ſincerity of their humble Addreſſes,

There are ſome, who thro hating of them, do wiſh their miſcarrying and offending to ſo unpardonable a degree, that they may hereafter be furniſhed with an advantage, both of ruining them and the whole <hi>Diſſenting Party</hi> for their ſakes. But as the love that I bear unto them, and the perſwaſion and belief I have of the truth of their <hi>Religious Principles,</hi> do make me exceeding ſollicitous to have them kept and prevented from being hurried and tranſported into ſo fatal and criminal a behaviour; ſo I deſire to make no other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for my plain dealing towards them, but that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> who tells us, <hi>that faithful are the wounds of a friend, while the kiſſes of an Enemy are deceitful;</hi> and that he <hi>who rebukes a man, ſhall find more favour afterwards than he who flattereth with the tongue.</hi>

               <p>SInce the foregoing <hi>Sheets</hi> went to the <hi>Preſs,</hi> and while they were <hi>Printing</hi> off, there is come to my hands a new <hi>Proclamation</hi> dated at <hi>Windſor</hi> the 28th. of <hi>June</hi> 1687, for granting further <hi>Liberty</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and which was publiſhed there by an <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Privy Council</hi> of that Kingdom bearing date at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the 5. of <hi>July.</hi> This <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foetation</hi> of one <hi>Proclamation</hi> after another in reference to the ſame thing, is ſo apporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned and parallel to the late <hi>French</hi> method of emitting <hi>Edicts</hi> in relation to thoſe of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> in that Kingdom, that they ſeem to proceed out of one <hi>mint,</hi> to be calculated for the ſame end, and to be deſigned for the compaſſing and obtaining the like effects. For aſſoon as an <hi>Alarm</hi> was taken at the publiſhing of ſome unreaſonable and rigorous <hi>Edict,</hi> there uſed often to follow another of a milder ſtrain, which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be either for the moderating the ſeverities of the former, or to remove and rectifie what they were pleaſed to call miſconſtructions unduly put upon it; but the true end whereof was only to ſtifle and extinguiſh the Jealouſies and Apprehenſions that the other had begotten and excited, and which had they not been calmed and allay'd might have awakened the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> there to provide for their ſafety by a timely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing into other Countries, if they had not been provoked to generous endeavours of preventing the final ſuppreſſion of their Religion, and for obviating the ruin which that <hi>Court</hi> had projected againſt them and was haſtning to involve them under. Nor does my ſuſpicion of his <hi>Majeſties</hi> purſuing the ſame deſign againſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> which the great <hi>Louis</hi> glories to have accompliſhed, proceed merely from that conjunction of Counſels that all the world obſerves between <hi>Whitehall</hi> and <hi>Verſailles;</hi> nor merely from the <hi>Kings</hi> abandoning his <hi>Nephew</hi> and Son-in-law the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> and not ſo much as interpoſing to obtain ſatisfaction to be given him, for the many Injuries, Damages, Spoiles, and Robberies, as well as Affronts done him by that haughty <hi>Monarch;</hi> when one vigorous Application could not fail to effect it; nor yet merely from that
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:48501:219"/>agreeableneſs in their proceedures, through the King of <hi>England</hi>'s imitating that Foreign <hi>Potentate,</hi> and making the whole courſe that hath been taken in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Pattern</hi> of all his actings in <hi>Great Britain;</hi> but I am much confirmed in my fears and jealouſies, by remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring a paſſage in one of Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s <hi>Letters,</hi> who as he very well knew what the then <hi>Duke of York,</hi> had been for many years engaged in, againſt our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Civil Lberties,</hi> and under what Vows and Promiſes he was, not to deſiſt from proſecuting what had been reſolved upon and undertaken; ſo he had the confidence to ſay, <hi>that his Maſter</hi>'s <hi>deſign, and that of the King of</hi> France, <hi>was one and the ſame;</hi> and that this was no leſs, as he farther informs us, than the <hi>extirpating the Northern Hereſie.</hi> Had the King of <hi>England</hi> acted with ſincerity from that noble Principle, <hi>that Conſcience ought not to be conſtrained, nor People forced in matters of mere Religion,</hi> as he would delude weak and eaſie People to believe; and had not all his Arbitrary and illegal proceedings in granting <hi>Liberty</hi> to <hi>Diſſenting Proteſtants</hi> been to ſubſerve and promote other Deſigns, which it is not yet ſeaſonable and convenient to diſcover and avow, he would have then acted with that conformity to the Principle he profeſſeth to be under the Influence and Government of, and with that conſonancy and harmonious agreeableneſs, in all the degrees of Indulgence, vouchſafed to thoſe of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that differ from them of the Eſtabliſhed way, that there would have needed no ſecond <hi>Proclamation</hi> apporting new meaſures of <hi>Liberty,</hi> and favour to <hi>Scots</hi> Diſſenters, ſeeing they would have had it granted them at firſt in the ſame latitude and illimitedneſs, that it was beſtowed upon the <hi>Engliſh Nonconformiſts.</hi> But when Princes carry on and purſue miſchievous deſigns, under the palliations of Religion, publick good, and the Right of Mankind; it comes often to paſs through adapting their methods to what they mean and intend, and not to what they pretend and give out, that their crafty projections by being not ſufficiently accommodated to their purpoſes, prove ineffectual to the compaſſing what was aim'd at; and this forceth them to a new Game of Falſhood and Subtilety, but ſtill under the old varniſh and gloſs, and obligeth them to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to means that may be more proportioned than the former were, for their reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the End that they ubtimately drive at. Thence it is that thoſe <hi>Rulers,</hi> who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the Proſecution of wicked and unjuſtifiable Deſigns, are neceſſitated not only to apply themſelves to oppoſite Methods towards different <hi>Parties,</hi> and thoſe ſuch as muſt be ſuited and apportioned to their diſcrepant Intereſt, without the accommodating of which they can neither hope to mould them to that tame and ſervile Compliance, nor work them up to that active and vigorous abetting of their malicious and crafty Proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions as is neceſſary for the rendring them Succeſsful; but they are forced to vary their Proceedings towards one and the ſame <hi>Party,</hi> and that as well when the ways they have acted in towards them are found inadequate to the end unto which they were calculated, as when the miſchief hid under them comes to be too ſoon diſcovered. This weak and ſhort-ſighted People fancy to ariſe from an uncertainty in Princes Counſels, and from their being at no Conſiſtency with themſelves; but they who can penetrate into Affairs, and that do conſider things more narrowly, can eaſily diſcern, that all this Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation, Diverſity, and ſhifting of Methods in <hi>Rulers</hi> Actings, proceed from other Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and that it is their Stability and Perſeverance in an illegal and wicked Deſign, that compels them to thoſe crooked and contrary Courſes, either for the gaining the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary and ill-applied Concurrence of their Subject, to the haſtning Diſtreſs and Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon themſelves, or for the throwing them into that Lethargy, and under that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineneſs, as may hinder them from all Endeavors of obſtructing and diverting the Evils, that their Governours are ſeeking to bring upon them. Nor is there a more certain Indication, of a <hi>Princes</hi> being engaged in a Deſign, contrary to the good and happineſs of the <hi>Society,</hi> over which he is ſet; than his betaking himſelf to illegal ways, upon pretence of promoting the eaſe and benefit of his People; or according as he finds his Subjects to differ in their particular Intereſts, his applying himſelf to them in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, whereof the contrariety of the one to the other, renders them the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and adapted to enſnare the divided Factions, through accoſting each of them with ſomething that they are ſeverally fond of. <hi>Legal means</hi> are always ſufficient to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing and compaſſing <hi>legal Ends;</hi> and whatſoever is for the general good of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,</hi> may either be obtained by Courſes, wherein the Generality find their united Intereſt and common Felicity, or elſe by Application to a <hi>Parliament</hi> freely and duly choſen, which as it repreſents the whole Politick Society, ſo there may be expected moſt Compaſſion and Tenderneſs, as well as Wiſdom and Prudence, for redreſſing the Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, eaſing the Troubles, and providing for the Benefit and Safety of all that are wrapt up in and repreſented by them. And as every <hi>Prince,</hi> who ſincerely ſeeks and purſues the Advantage of his People, will ſo adjuſt and attemper all his Actions towards them, that his whole Carriage ſhall be uniform, and all the Exerciſes of his Governing Power,

And tho his <hi>Majeſty</hi> would have us believe, that the reaſons moving him to the emiſſion of this <hi>ſecond Proclamation, were the ſiniſtruous Interpretations which either have, or may be made, of ſome Reſtrictions in his former;</hi> yet it is not difficult, even without being of his Privy Council, to aſſign a truer motive, and a more real and effectual cauſe of it. For as that of the 12 of <hi>February</hi> came forth attended with ſo many limitations, not eaſie to be digeſted by men of Wiſdom or Honeſty, leſt if it had been more unconfined and extenſive, and ſhould have opened a door for all <hi>Scots Diſſenters</hi> to have gone in and taken the benefit of it, the generality of Proteſtants in that Kingdom, abſtracting from the Biſhops, <hi>Curates,</hi> and a few others, ſhould have joined in the <hi>ſeparate</hi> Intereſt, and thereby have become an united Body againſt Popery; but upon finding that hardly any would pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe their freedom from the <hi>penal Laws</hi> at ſo dear a rate, as to do things ſo unbeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Men and Chriſtians, as the conforming to the <hi>Terms</hi> therein preſcribed obliged them unto; and that as they of the <hi>National Communion</hi> were alarm'd and diſguſted, ſo feſh or none of the <hi>Diſſenting Fellowſhips</hi> were pleaſed; and that both were not only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at the many illegal favours, and threatning advantages, beſtowed upon the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but were grown ſo ſenſible of the Deſign carrying on againſt the Proteſtant Religion, and the Liberties and Privileges of the Subject, that tho they could not renounce their reſpective Tenets in the matters wherein they differed, yet they were willing to ſtifle their Heats and Animoſities, and to give that Encouragement, Aid and Aſſiſtance to one another, as was neceſſary for their common ſafety: upon theſe <hi>Cnnſiderations,</hi> his <hi>Majeſty</hi> (if he would have ſpoken fincerely) ought to have ſaid, that he had publiſhed this <hi>new Proclamation,</hi> in order to hinder <hi>Scots Proteſtants</hi> from uniting, for their mutual defence againſt Turkiſh Tyranny, and Romiſh Idolatry, in hopes thereby to continue and exaſperate their undue and paſſionate heats, and to ſteep them not only in divided and oppoſite intereſts, but to make them contribute to the ſuppreſſing and ruining each other, or at leaſt to look on unconcernedly, till he have ripened his Deſigns againſt them both, and be prepared for extirpating the Reformed Religion, and for ſubverting the Fundamental as well as Statute Laws, and for bringing ſuch to the Stake and Gibbet as ſhall have the Integrity to aſſert the one, or the Courage to plead for the other. And
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:48501:220"/>yet in his <hi>laſt Proclamation,</hi> wherein he grants a more illimited Freedom, than in the former, and promiſeth to protect <hi>all in the Exerciſe of</hi> Their <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> as he Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfully and Ignominiouſly calls it; there is a Clauſe that may diſcourage all honeſt Men from owning their <hi>Liberty</hi> to the Authority that beſtows it, and from which it is derived and conveyed to them. For not being ſatisfied to ſuperſtruct his pretended Right, of <hi>Suſpending, Stopping</hi> and <hi>Diſabling Laws,</hi> upon his <hi>Sovereign Authority</hi> and <hi>Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Royal,</hi> but as knowing that theſe give no ſuch Pre-eminence and Juriſdiction over the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> he is pleaſed to challenge unto himſelf an <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> as the Source and Spring of that Exorbitant and Paramount Claim, which he therein exerciſeth and exerts.

For thoſe few Reflections in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Sheets, which this new <hi>Proclamation</hi> may not only ſeem to render uſeleſs, and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the end whereunto they were intended, but may make the publiſhing any Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions upon that, which the King, by departing from, does himſelf Cenſure and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, be eſteemed both a failure in Ingenuity and Candor, and a want of regard to thoſe Meaſures of Juſtice, which ought to be obſerved towards all Men, and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially towards Crowned Heads: I ſhall only ſay, that as the <hi>Proclamation</hi> arrived with me too late, to hinder and prevent the Communication of them to the Publick; ſo I have this farther to add, in Juſtification of their being publiſhed, that it will thereby appear, that what his <hi>Majeſty</hi> ſtiles <hi>Siniſtruous Interpretations made of ſome Reſtrictions menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in his former,</hi> are no other than the juſt, natural, genuine, and obvious Conſtructions, which they lye open unto, and are capable of, and which a Man cannot avoid faſtning upon them, without renouncing all Senſe and Reaſon.

               <hi>The Declaration of His Highneſs</hi> William Henry <hi>(by the Grace of God) Prince of</hi> Orange, <hi>&amp;c. Of the Reaſons inducing him to appear in Arms in the Kingdom of</hi> England, <hi>for Preſerving of the Proteſtant Religion, and for Reſtoring the Laws and Liberties of</hi> England, Scotland <hi>and</hi> Ireland.</head>
            <p>IT is both certain and evident to all Men, that the Publick Peace and Happineſs of any State or Kingdom cannot be preſerved, where the Laws, Liberties and Cuſtoms eſtabliſhed, by the Lawful Authority in it, are openly Tranſgreſſed and Annulled: More eſpecially where the Alteration of <hi>Religion</hi> is endeavored, and that a <hi>Religion</hi> which is contrary to Law is endeavored to be introduced: Upon which thoſe who are moſt immediately concerned in it, are Indiſpenſably bound to endeavor to preſerve and maintain the eſtabliſhed Laws, Liberties and Cuſtoms; and above all, the <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi> of God that is eſtabliſhed among them: And to take ſuch an effectual Care, that the Inhabitants of the ſaid State or Kingdom, may neither be deprived of their <hi>Religion,</hi> nor of their Civil Rights. Which is ſo much the more Neceſſary, becauſe the Greatneſs and Security both of Kings, Royal Families, and of all ſuch as are in Authority, as well as the Happineſs of their Subjects and People, depend, in a moſt eſpecial manner, upon the exact Obſervation and Maintenance of theſe their Laws, Liberties and Cuſtoms.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe grounds it is, that we cannot any longer forbear to Declare, That to our great Regret, we ſee that thoſe Counſellors, who have now the chief Credit with the King, have overturned the Religion, Laws and Liberties of thoſe Realms; and ſubjected them in all things relating to their Conſciences, Liberties and Properties, to Arbitrary Government; and that not only by Secret and Indirect ways, but in an open and undiſguiſed manner.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Evil Counſellors for the advancing and colouring this with ſome plauſible Pretexts, did invent and ſet on foot, the King's <hi>Diſpenſing Power,</hi> by virtue of which, they pretend, that according to <hi>Law,</hi> he can <hi>Suſpend</hi> and <hi>Diſpence</hi> with the Execution of the <hi>Laws,</hi> that have been enacted by the Authority of the King and Parliament, for the Security and Happineſs of the Subject, and ſo have rendered thoſe Laws of no Effect: Tho there is nothing more certain, than that as no Laws can be made, but by the joynt Concurrence of King and Parliament, ſo likewiſe Laws ſo enacted, which ſecure the Publick Peace and Safety of the Nation, and the Lives and Liberties of every Subject in it, cannot be Repealed or Suſpended, but by the ſame Authority.</p>
            <p>For tho the King may pardon the Puniſhment that a Tranſgreſſor has incurred, and to which he is condemned, as in the caſes of <hi>Treaſon</hi> or <hi>Felony;</hi> yet it cannot be with any colour of Reaſon inferred from thence, that the King can entirely Suſpend the Execution of thoſe Laws, relating to <hi>Treaſon</hi> or <hi>Felony:</hi> Unleſs it is pretended that he is cloathed with a Deſpotick and Arbitrary Power, and that the Lives, Liberties, Honors and Eſtates of the Subjects, depend wholly on his good Will and Pleaſure, and are entirely ſubject to him; which muſt infallibly follow, on the King's having a Power to <hi>Suſpend</hi> the Execution of <hi>Laws,</hi> and to <hi>Diſpenſe</hi> with them.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Evil Counſellors, in order to the giving ſome Credit to this ſtrange and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable Maxim, have ſo conducted the Matter, that they have obtained a Sentence from the Judges, declaring that this <hi>Diſpenſing Power</hi> is a Right belonging to the Crown; as if it were in the Power of the Twelve Judges, to offer up the Laws, Rights and Liberties of the whole Nation to the King, to be diſpoſed of by him Arbitrarily, and at his Pleaſure, and expreſly contrary to Laws enacted, for the Security of the Subjects. In order to the obtaining this Judgment, thoſe Evil Counſellors did before-hand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine ſecretly the Opinion of the Judges, and procured ſuch of them, as could not in Conſcience concur in ſo pernicious a Sentence, to be turned out, and others to be ſubſtituted in their rooms, till by the Changes which were made in the Courts of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, they at laſt obtained that Judgment. And they have raiſed ſome to thoſe Truſts, who make open Profeſſion of the Popiſh Religion, tho thoſe are by Law ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Incapable of all ſuch Employments.</p>
            <p>It is alſo Manifeſt and Notorious, that as his Majeſty was, upon his coming to the Crown, received and acknowledged by all the Subjects of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as their King, without the leaſt Oppoſition, tho he made then open Profeſſion of the <hi>Popiſh Religion,</hi> ſo he did then Promiſe, and Solemnly Swear, at his Coronation, that
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:48501:221"/>he would maintain his Subjects in the Free Enjoyment of their Laws, Rights and Liberties, and in particular, that he would maintain the <hi>Church of</hi> England <hi>as it was eſtabliſhed by Law:</hi> It is likewiſe certain, that there have been at diverſe and ſundry times, ſeveral Laws enacted for the Preſervation of thoſe Rights and Liberties, and of the Proteſtant Religion: And among other Securities, it has been enacted, That all Perſons whatſoever, that are advanced to any Eccleſiaſtical Dignity, or to bear Office in either Univerſity; as likewiſe all others, that ſhould be put in any Imployment, Civil or Military, ſhould declare that they were not Papiſts, but were of the Proteſtant Religion, and that by their taking of the Oaths of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and the <hi>Teſt;</hi> yet theſe Evil Counſellors have, in effect, annulled and aboliſhed all thoſe Laws, both with relation to Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Employments.</p>
            <p>In order to Eccleſiaſtical Dignities and Offices, they have not only without any colour of Law, but againſt moſt expreſs Laws to the contrary, ſet up a Commiſſion of a certain number of Perſons, to whom they have committed the Cogniſance and Direction of all Eccleſiaſtical Matters; in the which Commiſſion there has been and ſtill is, one of His Majeſties Miniſters of State, who makes now publick Profeſſion of the Popiſh Religion, and who at the time of his firſt profeſſing it, declared that for a great while before, he had believed that to be the only true Religion. By all this the deplorable State to which the Proteſtant Religion is reduced is apparent, ſince the Affairs of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are now put into the Hands of Perſons, who have accepted of a Commiſſion that is manifeſtly Illegal, and who have executed it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all Law; and that now one of their chief Members has abjured the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and declared himſelf a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> by which he is become incapable of holding any Publick Employment: The ſaid Commiſſioners have hitherto given ſuch proof of their Submiſſion to the Directions given them, that there is no reaſon to doubt, but they will ſtill continue to promote all ſuch Deſigns as will be moſt agreeable to them. And thoſe Evil Counſellors take care to raiſe none to any Eccleſiaſtical Dignities, but Perſons that have no Zeal for the Proteſtant Religion, and that now hide their Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernedneſs for it, under the ſpecious Pretence of <hi>Moderation.</hi> The ſaid Commiſſioners have Suſpended the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> only becauſe he refuſed to obey an Order that was ſent him to Suſpend a Worthy Divine, without ſo much as citing him before him, to make his own Defence, or obſerving the common Forms of Proceſs. They have turned out a Preſident, choſen by the Fellows of <hi>Magdalen</hi> College, and afterwards all the Fellows of that College, without ſo much as citing them before any Court that could take legal Cogniſance of that Affair, or obtaining any Sentence againſt them by a Competent Judge. And the only reaſon that was given for turning them out, was their refuſing to chuſe, for their Preſident, a Perſon that was recommended to them, by the Inſtigation of thoſe Evil Counſellors; tho the Right of a Free Election belonged undoubtedly to them. But they were turned out of their Freeholds, contrary to Law, and to that expreſs proviſion in the <hi>Magna Charta, That no Man ſhall looſe Life or Goods, but by the Law of the Land.</hi> And now theſe Evil Counſellors have put the ſaid College wholly into the Hands of Papiſts, tho, as is aboveſaid, they are incapable of all ſuch Employments, both by the Law of the Land, and the Statutes of the College. Theſe Commiſſioners have alſo cired before them all the Chancellors and Arch-deacons of <hi>England,</hi> requiring them to certifie to them the Names of all ſuch Clergy-men as have read the King's Declaration for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> and of ſuch as have not read it; without conſidering that the reading of it was not enjoyned the Clergy by the Biſhops, who are their Ordinaries. The Illegality and Incompetency of the ſaid Court of the Eccleſiaſtical Commiſſioners was ſo notoriouſly known, and it did ſo evidently appear, that it tended to the Subverſion of the Proteſtant Religion, that the Moſt Reverend Father in God, <hi>William</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Primate and Metropolitan of all <hi>England,</hi> ſeeing that it was raiſed for no other end, but to oppreſs ſuch Perſons as were of eminent Vertue, Learning and Piety, refuſed to ſit or to concur in it.</p>
            <p>And tho there are many expreſs Laws againſt all Churches or Chappels, for the Exerciſe of the Popiſh Religion, and alſo againſt all Monaſteries and Convents, and more particularly againſt the Order of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> yet thoſe Evil Counſellors have procured orders for the building of ſeveral Churches and Chappels, for the Exerciſe of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: They have alſo procured diverſe Monaſteries to be erected, and in contempt of the Law, they have not only ſet up ſeveral Colleges of <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> in diverſe places, for the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting of the Youth, but have raiſed up one of the <hi>Order</hi> to be a Privy Counſellor and a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of State. By all which they do evidently ſhow, that they are reſtrained by no Rules or Law whatſoever; but that they have ſubjected the Honors and Eſtates of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and the eſtabliſh'd Religion to a Deſpotick Power, and to Arbitrary Government; in all which they are ſerved and ſeconded by thoſe Eccleſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſtical Commiſſioners.</p>
            <pb n="422" facs="tcp:48501:222"/>
            <p>They have alſo followed the ſame Methods with relation to Civil Affairs: For they have procured orders to examine all Lords-Lieutenants, Deputy-Lieutenants, Sheriffs, Juſtices of Peace, and all others that were in any publick Imployment, if they would concur with the King in the Repeal of the <hi>Teſt</hi> and <hi>Penal Laws;</hi> and all ſuch, whoſe Conſciences did not ſuffer them to comply with their Deſigns, were turned out, and others were put in their places, who they believed would be more compliant to them, in their deſigns of defeating the intent and Execution of thoſe Laws, which had been made with ſo much Care and Caution for the Security of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi> And in many of theſe places they have put profeſſed Papiſts, tho the Law has diſabled them, and warranted the Subjects not to have any regard to their Order.</p>
            <p>They have alſo invaded the Privileges, and ſeiſed on the Charters of moſt of thoſe Towns that have a right to be repreſented by their Burgeſſes in Parliament; and have procured Surrenders to be made of them, by which the Magiſtrates in them have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up all their Rights and Privileges, to be diſpoſed of at the Pleaſure of thoſe Evil Counſellors; who have thereupon placed new Magiſtrates in thoſe Towns, ſuch as they can moſt entirely confide in; and in many of them they have put Popiſh Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, notwithſtanding the Incapacities under which the Law has put them.</p>
            <p>And whereas no Nation whatſoever can ſubſiſt without the Adminiſtration of good and impartial Juſtice, upon which Men Lives, Liberties, Honors and Eſtates do depend; thoſe Evil Counſellors have ſubjected theſe to an Arbitrary and Deſpotick Power: In the moſt important Affairs they have ſtudied to diſcover before-hand the Opinions of the Judges; and have turned out ſuch, as they found would not conform themſelves to their Intentions; and have put others in their places, of whom they were more aſſured, without having any regard to their Abilities. And they have not ſtuck to raiſe even profeſſed Papiſts to the Courts of Judicature, notwithſtanding their Incapacity by Law, and that no regard is due to any Sentences flowing from them. They have carried this ſo far, as to deprive ſuch Judges, who in the common Adminiſtration of Juſtice, ſhew that they were governed by their Conſciences, and not by the Directions which the others gave them: By which it is apparent, that they deſign to render themſelves the abſolute Maſters of the Lives, Honors and Eſtates of the Subjects, of what Rank or Dignity ſoever they may be; and that without having any regard either to the Equity of the Cauſe, or to the Conſciences of the Judges, whom they will have to ſubmit in all things to their own Will and Pleaſure; hoping by ſuch ways to intimidate thoſe other Judges, who are yet in Imployment, as alſo ſuch others as they ſhall think fit to put in the rooms of thoſe whom they have turned out; and to make them ſee what they muſt look for, if they ſhould at any time act in the leaſt contrary to their good liking; and that no Failings of that kind are pardoned in any Perſons whatſoever. A great deal of Blood has been ſhed in many places of the Kingdom, by Judges go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by thoſe Evil Counſellors, againſt all the Rules and Forms of Law; without ſo much as ſuffering the Perſons that were accuſed to plead in their own Defence.</p>
            <p>They have alſo, by putting the Adminiſtration of Juſtice in the Hands of Papiſts, brought all the Matters of Civil Juſtice into great Uncertainties; with how much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs and Juſtice ſoever that theſe Sentences may have been given. For ſince the Laws of the Land do not only exclude Papiſts from all places of Judicature, but have put them under an Incapacity, none are bound to acknowledge or to obey their Judgments, and all Sentences given by them, are null and void of themſelves; ſo that all Perſons who have been caſt in Trials before ſuch Popiſh Judges, may juſtly look on their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Sentences, as having no more Force than the Sentences of any private and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>authoriſed Perſon whatſoever. So deplorable is the caſe of the Subjects, who are obliged to anſwer to ſuch Judges, that muſt in all things ſtick to the Rules which are ſet them by thoſe Evil Counſellors, who as they raiſed them up to thoſe Imployments, ſo can turn them out of them at pleaſure, and who can never be eſteemed Lawful Judges; ſo that all their Sentences are in the Conſtruction of the Law, of no Force and Efficacy. They have likewiſe diſpoſed of all Military Imployments in the ſame manner: For tho the Laws have not only excluded Papiſts from all ſuch Imployments, but have in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular provided that they ſhould be diſarmed; yet they in contempt of thoſe Laws, have not only armed the Papiſts, but have likewiſe raiſed them up to the greateſt Military Truſts, both by Sea and Land, and that Strangers as well as Natives, and Iriſh as well as Engliſh, that ſo by theſe means they having rendered themſelves Maſters both of the Affairs of the Church, of the Government of the Nation, and of the courſe of Juſtice, and ſubjected them all to a Deſpotick and Arbitrary Power, they might be in a capacity to maintain and execute their wicked Deſigns by the aſſiſtance of the Army, and thereby to enſlave the Nation.</p>

            <p>The diſmal Effects of this Subverſion of the eſtabliſhed Religion, Laws and Liberties in <hi>England,</hi> appear more evidently to us, by what we ſee done in <hi>Ireland;</hi> where the whole Government is put into the hands of Papiſts, and where all the Proteſtant Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants are under the daily Fears of what may be juſtly apprehended from the Arbitrary Power which is ſet up there; which has made great Numbers of them leave that Kingdom, and abandon their Eſtates in it, remembering well that Cruel and Bloody Maſſacre which fell out in that Iſland in the year 1641.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Evil Counſellors have alſo prevailed with the King to declare in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that he is cloathed with <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> and that all the Subjects are bound <hi>to obey him without Reſerve;</hi> upon which he has aſſumed an Arbitrary Power, both over the Religion and Laws of that Kingdom; from all which it is apparent, what is to be looked for in <hi>England,</hi> as ſoon as Matters are duly prepared for it.</p>
            <p>Thoſe great and inſufferable Oppreſſions, and the open Contempt of all Law, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Apprehenſions of the ſaid Conſequences that muſt certainly follow upon it, have put the Subjects under great and juſt Fears; and have made them look after ſuch lawful Remedies as are allowed of in all Nations; yet all has been without effect. And thoſe Evil Counſellors have endeavored to make all Men apprehend the loſs of their Lives, Liberties, Honors and Eſtates, if they ſhould go about to preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from this Oppreſſion by Petitions, Repreſentations, or other means authoriſed by Law. Thus did they proceed with the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the other Biſhops, who having offered a moſt Humble Petition to the King, in Terms full of Reſpect, and not exceeding the number limited by Law, in which they ſet forth in ſhort, the Reaſons for which they could not obey that Order, which by the Inſtigation of thoſe Evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors was ſent them, requiring them to appoint their Clergy to read in their Churches the Declaration for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience;</hi> were ſent to Priſon, and afterwards brought to a Trial, as if they had been guilty of ſome enormous Crime. They were not only obliged to defend themſelves in that purſuit, but to appear before profeſſed Papiſts, who had not taken the Teſt, and by conſequence were Men whoſe Intereſt led them to condemn them; and the Judges that gave their Opinion in their Favors, were thereupon turned out.</p>
            <p>And yet it cannot be pretended that any Kings, how great ſoever their Power has been, and how Arbitrary and Deſpotick ſoever they have been in the Exerciſe of it, have ever reckoned it a Crime for their Subjects to come in all Submiſſion and Reſpect, and in a due Number, not exceeding the Limits of the Law, and repreſent to them the Reaſons that made it impoſſible for them to obey their Orders. Thoſe Evil Counſellors have alſo treated a Peer of the Realm as a Criminal, only becauſe he ſaid, that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were not bound to obey the orders of a Popiſh Juſtice of Peace; tho it is evident, that they being by Law rendred incapable of all ſuch Truſt, no regard is due to their orders: This being the Security which the People have by the Law for their Lives, Liberties, Honors and Eſtates, that they are not to be ſubjected to the Arbitrary Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Papiſts, that are, contrary to Law, put into any Employments Civil or Military.</p>
            <p>Both we our ſelves, and our Deareſt and moſt Entirely Beloved Conſort, the Princeſs, have endeavored to ſignifie in Terms full of Reſpect to the King, the juſt and deep Regret which all theſe Proceedings have given us; and in Compliance with His Majeſties Deſires ſignified to us, we declared both by word of Mouth, to his Envoy, and in Writing, what our Thoughts were, touching the Repealing of the <hi>Teſt and Penal Laws;</hi> which we did in ſuch a manner, that we hoped we had propoſed an Expedient, by which the Peace of thoſe Kingdoms, and a happy Agreement among the Subjects, of all Perſwaſions, might have been ſettled; but thoſe Evil Counſellors have put ſuch ill Conſtructions on theſe our good Intentions, that they have endeavored to alienate the King more and more from us; as if we had deſigned to diſturb the Quiet and Happineſs of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The laſt and great Remedy for all thoſe Evils, is <hi>The calling of a Parliament,</hi> for ſecuring the Nation againſt the Evil Practiſes of thoſe wicked Counſellors; but this could not be yet compaſſed, nor can it be eaſily brought about. For thoſe Men apprehending, that a lawful Parliament being once aſſembled, they would be brought to an account for all their open Violations of Law, and for their Plots and Conſpiracies againſt the Proteſtant Religion, and the Lives and Liberties of the Subjects, they have endeavored, under the ſpecious Pretence of <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> firſt to ſow Diviſions among Proteſtants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Diſſenters: The deſign being laid to engage Proteſtants, that are all equally concerned, to preſerve themſelves from Popiſh Oppreſſion, into mutual Quarrellings; that ſo by theſe, ſome Advantages might be given to them to bring about their Deſigns; and that both in the Election of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parliament, and afterwards in the Parliament it ſelf. For they ſee well, that if all Proteſtants could enter into a mutual good Underſtanding one with another, and concur together in the Preſerving of their Religion, it would not be poſſible for them to
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:48501:223"/>compaſs their wicked ends. They have alſo required all Perſons in the ſeveral Counties of <hi>England,</hi> that either were in any Imployment, or were in any conſiderable Eſteem, to declare before-hand, that they would concur in the Repeal of the <hi>Teſt and Penal Laws;</hi> and that they would give their Voices in the Elections to Parliament, only for ſuch as would concur in it. Such as would not thus pre-ingage themſelves, were turned out of all Imployments; and others who entered into thoſe Engagements were put in their places, many of them being Papiſts. And contrary to the Charters and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of thoſe Boroughs, that have a Right to ſend Burgeſſes to Parliament, they have ordered ſuch Regulations to be made, as they thought fit and neceſſary, for aſſuring themſelves of all the Members that are to be choſen by thoſe Corporations; and by this means they hope to avoid that Puniſhment which they have deſerved; tho it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that all Acts made by Popiſh Magiſtrates, are null and void of themſelves; ſo that no Parliament can be Lawful, for which the Elections and Returns are made by Popiſh Sheriffs and Mayors of Towns; and therefore as long as the Authority and Magiſtracy is in ſuch Hands, it is not poſſible to have any Lawful Parliament. And tho according to the Conſtitution of the Engliſh Government, and Immemorial Cuſtom, all Elections of Parliament-men ought to be made with an entire Liberty, without any ſort of Force, or the requiring the Electors to chuſe ſuch Perſons as ſhall be named to them, and the Perſons thus freely elected, ought to give their Opinions freely, upon all Matters that are brought before them, having the good of the Nation ever before their Eyes, and following in all things the Dictates of their Conſcience, yet now the People of <hi>England</hi> cannot expect a Remedy from a Free Parliament, legally Called and Choſen. But they may perhaps ſee one called, in which all Elections will be carried by Fraud or Force, and which will be compoſed of ſuch Perſons, of whom thoſe Evil Counſellors hold themſelves well aſſured, in which all things will be carried on according to their Direction and Intereſt, without any regard to the Good or Happineſs of the Nation. Which may appear evidently from this, that the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons tried the Members of the laſt Parliament, to gain them to conſent to the Repeal of the <hi>Teſt and Penal Laws;</hi> and procured that Parliament to be diſſolved, when they found that they could not, neither by Promiſes nor Threatnings, prevail with the Members to comply with their wicked Deſigns.</p>
            <p>But to Crown all, there are great and violent Preſumptions, inducing us to believe, that thoſe Evil Counſellors, in order to the carrying on of their ill Deſigns, and to the gaining to themſelves the more time for the effecting of them, for the encouraging of their Complices, and for the diſcouraging of all Good Subjects, have publiſhed, that the <hi>Queen</hi> hath brought forth a <hi>Son;</hi> tho there have appeared both during the <hi>Queens</hi> Pretended Biggneſs, and in the manner in which the Birth was managed, ſo many juſt and viſible Grounds of Suſpition, that not only we our ſelves, but all the good Subjects of thoſe Kingdoms, do vehemently ſuſpect, that the Pretended Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was not born by the <hi>Queen.</hi> And it is notoriouſly known to all the World, that many both doubted of the Queens Biggneſs, and of the Birth of the Child, and yet there was not any one thing done to ſatisfie them, or to put an end to their Doubts.</p>
            <p>And ſince our Deareſt and moſt Entirely Beloved Conſort, the Princeſs, and likewiſe we our ſelves, have ſo great an Intereſt in this Matter, and ſuch a Right, as all the World knows, to the Succeſſion to the Crown; ſince alſo the Engliſh did in the Year 1672. when the States General of the <hi>United Provinces</hi> were Invaded in a moſt unjuſt War, uſe their utmoſt Endeavors to put an end to that War, and that in Oppoſition to thoſe who were then in the Government; and by their ſo doing, they run the Hazard of loſing both the Favor of the Court, and their Imployments: And ſince the Engliſh Nation has ever teſtified a moſt particular Affection and Eſteem both to our Deareſt Conſort the Princeſs, and to our ſelves, We cannot excuſe our ſelves from eſpouſing their Intereſts, in a matter of ſuch high Conſequence, and from Contributing all that lies in us, for the Maintaining both of the Proteſtant Religion, and of the Laws and Liberties of thoſe Kingdoms, and for the Securing to them the continual Enjoyment of all their juſt Rights. To the doing of which, we are moſt earneſtly ſolicited by a great many Lords, both Spiritual and Temporal, and by many Gentlemen and other Subjects of all Ranks.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is, that we have thought fit to go over to <hi>England,</hi> and to carry over with us a Force, ſufficient, by the Bleſſing of God, to defend us from the Violence of thoſe Evil Counſellors. And we being deſirous that our Intentions in this may be rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, have for this end prepared this <hi>Declaration,</hi> in which as we have hitherto given a true Account of the Reaſons inducing us to it, So we now think fit to Declare, that this our Expedition, is intended for no other Deſign, but to have a free and lawful Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſſembled as ſoon as is poſſible; and that in order to this, all the late Charters, by
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:48501:223"/>which the Elections of Burgeſſes are limited contrary to the Ancient Cuſtom, ſhall be conſidered as null and of no force: And likewiſe all Magiſtrates who have been Injuſtly turned out, ſhall forthwith reſume their former Imployments, as well as all the Boroughs of <hi>England</hi> ſhall return again to their Ancient Preſcriptions and Charters: And more particularly that the Ancient Charter of the Great and Famous City of <hi>London</hi> ſhall again be in Force: And that the Writs for the Members of Parliament ſhall be addreſſed to the proper Officers according to Law and Cuſtom. That alſo none be ſuffered to chooſe or to be choſen Members of Parliament, but ſuch as are qualified by Law: And that the Members of Parliament, being thus lawfully choſen, they ſhall meet and ſit in full Freedom, that ſo the Two Houſes may concur in the preparing of ſuch Laws, as they upon full and free Debate ſhall judge neceſſary and convenient, both for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming and executing the Law concerning the <hi>Teſt,</hi> and ſuch other Laws as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Security and Maintenance of the Proteſtant Religion; as likewiſe for making ſuch Laws as may eſtabliſh a good Agreement between the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and all Proteſtant Diſſenters, as alſo for the covering and ſecuring of all ſuch, who will live Peaceable under the Government as becomes good Subjects, from all Perſecution, upon the account of their Religion, even <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves not excepted; and for the doing of all other things, which the Two Houſes of Parliament ſhall find neceſſary for the Peace, Honor and Safety of the Nation; ſo that there may be no more danger of the Nations falling at any time hereafter, under <hi>Arbitrary Government.</hi> To this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we will alſo refer the Enquiry into the Birth of the Pretended Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and of all things relating to it, and to the Right of Succeſſion.</p>
            <p>And we, for our part, will concur in every thing that may procure the Peace and Happineſs of the Nation, which a Free and Lawful Parliament ſhall determine; Since we have nothing before our Eyes, in this our Undertaking, but the Preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion, the covering of all Men from Perſecution for their Conſciences, and the Securing to the whole Nation the free Enjoyment of all their Laws, Rights and Liberties, under a Juſt and Legal Government.</p>
            <p>This is the deſign that we have propoſed to our ſelves, in appearing upon this occaſion in Arms: In the Conduct of which, we will keep the Forces under our Command, under all the Strictneſs of Martial Diſcipline; and take a ſpecial Care, that the People of the Countries, through which we muſt march, ſhall not ſuffer by their means: And as ſoon as the State of the Nation will admit of it, we promiſe that we will ſend back all thoſe Foreign Forces that we have brought along with us.</p>
            <p>We do therefore hope, that all People will judge rightly of us, and approve of theſe our Proceedings: But we chiefly rely on the Bleſſing of God, for the Succeſs of this our Undertaking, in which we place our whole and only Confidence.</p>
            <p>We do, in the laſt place, invite and require all Perſons whatſoever, all the Peers of the Realm, both Spiritual and Temporal, all Lords-Lieutenants, Deputy-Lieutenants, and all Gentlemen, Citizens, and other Commons of all Ranks, to come and aſſiſt us, in order to the Executing of this our Deſign, againſt all ſuch as ſhall endeavor to oppoſe us; that ſo we may prevent all thoſe Miſeries which muſt needs follow, upon the Nations being kept under Arbitrary Government and Slavery: And that all the Violences and Diſorders, which have overturned the whole Conſtitution of the Engliſh Government, may be fully redreſſed, in a <hi>Free and Legal Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And we do likewiſe reſolve, that as ſoon as the Nations are brought to a State of Quiet, we will take care that a Parliament ſhall be called in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the reſtoring the Ancient Conſtitution of that Kingdom, and for bringing the Matters of Religion to ſuch a Settlement, that the People may live Eaſie and Happy, and for putting an end to all the Injuſt Violences that have been in a courſe of ſo many Years committed there.</p>
            <p>We will alſo ſtudy to bring the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> to ſuch a State, that the Settlement there may be Religiouſly obſerved; and that the Proteſtant and Britiſh Intereſt there may be ſecured. And we will endeavor, by all poſſible means, to procure ſuch an Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all the Three Kingdoms, that they may all live in a Happy Union and Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence together; and that the Proteſtant Religion, and the Peace, Honor and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of thoſe Nations, may be eſtabliſhed upon Laſting Foundations.</p>

            <head>His Highneſs's Additional Declaration.</head>
            <p>AFter we had prepared and printed this our Declaration, we have underſtood, that the Subverters of the Religion and Laws of thoſe Kingdoms, hearing of our Preparations to aſſiſt the People againſt them, have begun to retract ſome of the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and Deſpotick Powers that they had aſſumed, and to vacate ſome of their Injuſt Judgments and Decrees. The Senſe of their Guilt, and the diſtruſt of their Force, have induced them to offer to the City of <hi>London,</hi> ſome ſeeming Relief from their Great Oppreſſions; hoping thereby to quiet the People, and to divert them from demanding a Secure Re-eſtabliſhment of their Religion and Laws under the ſhelter of our Arms. They do alſo give out, that we intend to Conquer and Enſlave the Nation: And therefore it is, that we have thought fit to add a few words to our Declaration.</p>
            <p>We are Confident, that no Perſons can have ſuch hard thought of us, as to imagine that we have any other Deſign in this Undertaking, than to procure a Settlement of the Religion, and of the Liberties and Properties of the Subjects upon ſo ſure a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, that there may be no danger of the Nations relapſing into the like Miſeries at any time hereafter. And as the Forces that we have brought along with us, are utterly diſproportioned to that wicked Deſign of Conquering the Nation, if we were capable of intending it, ſo the Great Numbers of the Principal Nobility and Gentry, that are Men of Eminent Quality and Eſtates, and Perſons of known Integrity and Zeal both for the Religion and Government of <hi>England;</hi> many of them being alſo diſtinguiſhed by their conſtant Fidelity to the Crown, who do both accompany us in this Expedition, and have earneſtly ſolicited us to it, will cover us from all ſuch Malicious Inſinuations. For it is not to be imagined, that either thoſe who have invited us, or thoſe that are already come to aſſiſt us, can joyn in a wicked Attempt of Conqueſt, to make void their own lawful Titles to their Honors, Eſtates and Intereſts. We are alſo confident, that all Men ſee how little weight there is to be laid, on all Promiſes and Engagements that can be now made; ſince there has been ſo little regard had in time paſt, to the moſt ſolemn Promiſes. And as that imperfect Redreſs that is now offered, is a plain Confeſſion of thoſe Violations of the Government that we have ſet forth; ſo the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiveneſs of it is no leſs Apparent, for they lay down nothing which they may not take up at Pleaſure; and they reſerve entire, and not ſo much as mentioned, their Claims and Pretences to an Arbitrary and Deſpotick Power; which has been the Root of all their Oppreſſion, and of the total Subverſion of the Government. And it is plain, that there can be no Redreſs nor Remedy offered but in Parliament; by a Declaration of the Rights of the Subjects that have been invaded; and not by any Pretended Acts of Grace, to which the Extremity of their Affairs has driven them. Therefore it is that we have thought fit to declare, That we will refer all to a Free Aſſembly of the Nation, in a Lawful Parliament.</p>

               <hi>By his Highneſs</hi> William Henry, <hi>Prince of</hi> Orange, <hi>A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration. Printed in the Year,</hi> 1688.</head>
            <p>WE have in the courſe of our whole Life, and more particularly by the apparent Hazards both by Sea and Land, to which we have ſo lately expoſed our Perſon, given to the whole World ſo high and undoubted Proofs of our fervent Zeal for the Proteſtant Religion, that we are fully confident no true Engliſh-man and good Proteſtant can entertain the leaſt Suſpicion of our firm Reſolution, rather to ſpend our deareſt Blood and periſh in the Attempt, than not carry on the Bleſſed and Glorious Deſign which by the Favour of Heaven we have ſo ſucceſsfully begun, to Reſcue <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> from Slavery and Popery, and in a Free Parliament to Eſtabliſh the Religion, the Laws, and the Liberties of thoſe Kingdoms upon ſuch a ſure and laſting Foundation, that it ſhall not be in the Power of any Prince for the future to introduce Popery and Tyranny.</p>
            <p>Towards the more eaſy Compaſſing this great Deſign, we have not been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deceived in the juſt Expectation we had of the Concurrence of the Nobility, Gentry, and People of <hi>England</hi> with Us, for the Security of their Religion, the Reſtitution of the Laws, and the Re-eſtabliſhment of their Liberties and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: Great Numbers of all Ranks and Qualities having joyned themſelves to us; and others at great Diſtances from Us, have taken up Arms and Declared for Us. And, which we cannot but particularly mention, in that Army which was Raiſed to be the Inſtrument of Slavery and Popery, may (by the ſpecial Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God) both Officers and common Souldiers have been touched with ſuch a feeling ſenſe of Religion and Honour, and of true Affection for their Native Country, that they have already deſerted the Illegal Service they were ingaged in, and have come over to Us, and have given us full Aſſurance from the reſt of the Army, That they will certainly follow this Example, as ſoon as with our Army we ſhall approach near enough to receive them, without the Hazard of being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and betray'd. To which end, and that we may the ſooner execute this juſt and neceſſary Deſign we are ingaged in for the publick Safety and Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of theſe Nations, We are reſolved, with all poſſible Diligence, to advance forward, that a Free Parliament may be forthwith called, and ſuch Preliminaries adjuſted with the King, and all things firſt ſettled upon ſuch a foot according to Law, as may give Us and the whole Nation juſt Reaſon to believe the King is diſpoſed to make ſuch neceſſary Condeſcenſions on his part, as will give intire Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and Security to all, and make both King and People once more happy.</p>
            <p>And that we may effect all this, in the way moſt agreeable to our Deſires, if it be poſſible, without the Effuſion of any Blood, except of thoſe execrable Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals who have juſtly forfeited their Lives for betraying the Religion and Subvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Laws of their Native Country, We do think fit to declare, That as we will offer no Violence to any but in our own neceſſary Defence; ſo we will not ſuffer any Injury to be done to the Perſon even of a Papiſt, provided he be found in ſuch Place, and in ſuch Condition and Circumſtances as the Laws require. So we are reſolved and do declare that all Papiſts, who ſhall be found in open Arms, or with Arms in their Houſes, or about their Perſons, or in any Office or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment Civil or Military upon any Pretence whatſoever contrary to the known Laws of the Land, ſhall be treated by Us and our Forces not as Soldiers and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, but as Robbers, Free-Booters and <hi>Banditti;</hi> they ſhall be incapable of Quarter, and intirely delivered up to the Diſcretion of our Soldiers. And We do further declare that all Perſons who ſhall be found any ways aiding and aſſiſting to them, or ſhall march under their Command, or ſhall joyn with or ſubmit to them in the Diſcharge or Execution of their Illegal Commiſſions or Authority, ſhall be looked upon as Partakers of their Crimes, Enemies to the Laws, and to their Country.</p>
            <p>And whereas we are certainly informed that great Numbers of armed Papiſts have of late reſorted to <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and parts adjacent, where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, as we have reaſon to ſuſpect, not ſo much for their own Security, as out of a wicked and barbarous Deſign to make ſome deſperate Attempt upon the ſaid Cities, and their Inhabitants by Fire, or a ſudden Maſſacre, or both; or elſe to be the more ready to joyn themſelves to a Body of <hi>French</hi> Troops, deſigned, if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:48501:225"/>to land in <hi>England,</hi> procured of the French King, by the Intereſt and Power of the Jeſuits in Purſuance of the Engagements, which at the Inſtigation of that peſtilent Society, his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, with one of his Neighbouring Princes of the ſame Communion, has entred into for the utter Extirpation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion out of <hi>Europe.</hi> Tho we hope we have taken ſuch effectual care to prevent the one, and ſecure the other, that by God's Aſſiſtance, we cannot doubt but we ſhall defeat all their wicked Enterpriſes and Deſigns.</p>
            <p>We cannot however forbear out of the great and tender Concern We have to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the People of <hi>England,</hi> and particularly thoſe great and populous Cities, from the cruel Rage and bloody Revenge of the Papiſts, to Require and expect from all the Lord-Lieutenants, Deputy-Lieutenants, and Juſtices of the Peace, Lord-Mayors, Mayors, Sheriffs, and all other Magiſtrates and Officers Civil and Military, of all Counties, Cities and Towns of <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially of the County of <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex,</hi> and Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and parts adjacent, that they do immediately diſarm and ſecure, as by Law they may and ought, within their reſpective Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Cities and Juriſdictions, all Papiſts whatſoever, as Perſons at all times, but now eſpecially moſt dangerous to the Peace and Safety of the Government, that ſo not only all Power of doing miſchief may be taken from them; but that the Laws, which are the greateſt and beſt Security, may reſume their Force, and be ſtrictly Executed.</p>
            <p>And We do hereby likewiſe Declare that We will Protect and Defend all thoſe who ſhall not be afraid to do their Duty in Obedience to theſe Laws. And that for thoſe Magiſtrates and others of what condition ſoever they be, who ſhall refuſe to aſſiſt Us, and in Obedience to the Laws to Execute vigorouſly what we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them, and ſuffer themſelves at this Juncture to be cajoled or terrified out of ther Duty, We will eſteem them the moſt Criminal and Infamous of all Men; Betrayers of their Religion, the Laws, and their Native Country, and ſhall not fail to treat them accordingly; reſolving to expect and require at their hands the Life of every ſingle Proteſtant that ſhall periſh, and every Houſe that ſhall be burnt or deſtroyed by their Treachery and Cowardiſe.</p>

            <p>NExt to the Duty which we owe to God, which ought to be the principal Care of Men of your Profeſſion eſpecially, (becauſe you carry your Lives in your Hands, and often look Death in the Face); The ſecond Thing that deſerves your Conſideration, is, The ſervice of your Native Country, wherein you drew your firſt Breath, and breathed a free Engliſh Air. Now I would deſire you to conſider,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:48501:225"/>how well you comply with theſe two main Points, by engaging in this preſent Service.</p>
            <p>Is it in the Name of God, and for his Service, that you have joyned your ſelves with <hi>Papiſts;</hi> who will indeed fight for the <hi>Maſs-book</hi> but burn the <hi>Bible,</hi> and who ſeek to Extirpate the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> with <hi>Your Swords,</hi> becauſe they cannot do it with their <hi>Own?</hi> And will you be Aiding and Aſſiſting to ſet up <hi>Maſs-houſes,</hi> to Erect that Popiſh Kingdom of Darkneſs and Deſolation amongſt us, and to train up all our Children in <hi>Popery?</hi> How can you do theſe Things, and yet call your ſelves <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then what Service can be done your Country, by being under the Command of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Iriſh Papists,</hi> and by bringing the Nation under a Foreign Yoke? Will you help them to make forcible Entry into the Houſes of your Country-men, under the Name of <hi>Quartering,</hi> directly contrary to <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and the <hi>Petition of Right?</hi> Will you be Aiding and Aſſiſting to all the Murders and Outrages which they ſhall commit by their void Commiſſions? Which were declared Illegal, and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently blaſted by both Houſes of Parliament, (if there had been any need of it) for it was very well known before, That a <hi>Papiſt</hi> cannot have a Commiſſion, but by the Law is utterly Diſabled and Diſarmed. Will you exchange your Birth-right of <hi>Engliſh Laws</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> for <hi>Martial</hi> or <hi>Club-law,</hi> and help to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all others, only to be eaten laſt your ſelves? If I know you well, as you are Engliſh Men, you hate and ſcorn theſe Things. And therefore be not unequally yoaked with <hi>Idolatrous</hi> and <hi>Bloody Papiſts. Be Valiant for the Truth, and ſhew your ſelves Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame Conſiderations are likewiſe humbly offered to all the <hi>Engliſh Seamen,</hi> who have been the Bulwark of this Nation againſt <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery</hi> ever ſince <hi>Eighty Eight.</hi>

               <hi>Several Reaſons for the Eſtabliſhment of a ſtanding Army, and Diſſolving the</hi> Militia. <hi>By Mr.</hi> S. Johnſon.</head>

BEcauſe the Lords Lieutenants, Deputy Lieutenants, and the whole <hi>Militia,</hi> that is to ſay, the Lords, Gentlemen, and Free-holders of <hi>England,</hi> are not fit to be truſted with their own Laws, Lives, Liberties, and Eſtates, and therefore ought to have Guardians and Keepers aſſigned to them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe <hi>Mercenary Soldiers,</hi> who fight for twelve Pence a Day, will fight better, as having more to loſe than either the Nobility or Gentry.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe there are no <hi>Iriſh Papiſts</hi> in the <hi>Militia,</hi> who are certainly the beſt Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in the World, for they have ſlain Men, Women, and Children, by Hundreds of Thouſands at once.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Becauſe the <hi>Dragooners</hi> have made more Converts than all the Biſhops and Clergy of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The Parliament ought to eſtabliſh one ſtanding Army at the leaſt, becauſe indeed there will be need of Two, that one of them may defend the People from the other.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Becauſe it is a thouſand pities that a brave <hi>Popiſh Army</hi> ſhould be a Riot.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Unleſs it be Eſtabliſhed by Act of Parliament, The Juſtices of Peace will be forced to ſuppreſs it in their own Defence; for they will be loth to forfeit an hundred Pounds every day they riſe, out of Complement to a <hi>Popiſh Rout.</hi> 13 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 7. 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Becauſe a <hi>Popiſh Army</hi> is a <hi>Nullity.</hi> For all <hi>Papiſts</hi> are utterly diſabled (and puniſhable beſides) from bearing any Office in Camp, Troop, Band, or Company of Soldiers, and are ſo far diſarmed by Law, that they cannot wear a Sword, ſo much as in their Defence, without the allowance of four Juſtices of the Peace of the County: And then upon a March they will be perfectly Inchanted, for they are not able to ſtir above five Miles from their own Dwelling-houſe. 3. <hi>Jac.</hi> 5. <hi>Sect.</hi> 8.27, 28, 29.35 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 2.3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 5. <hi>Sect.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Becauſe Perſons utterly diſabled by Law are utterly Unauthorized; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the void Commiſſions of Killing and Slaying in the Hands of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> can only enable them to Maſſacre and Murder.</p>

            <p>WITH a Heart full of Grief am I forced to Write, what Prudence will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to ſay to your Face. And may I e'er find Credit with your Majeſty, and protection from Heaven, as what I now do, is free from Paſſion, Vanity or Deſign, with which Actions of this Nature are too often accompanied. I am not ignorant of the frequent Miſchiefs wrought in the World by factious pretences of Religion; but were not Religion the moſt juſtifiable Cauſe, it would not be made the moſt ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pretence. And your Majeſty has always ſhewn too unintereſted a Senſe of Religion, to doubt the juſt Effects of it in one whoſe Practices, have, I hope, never given the World cauſe to cenſure his real conviction of it, or his backwardneſs to perform what his Honour and Conſcience prompt him to: How then can I longer diſguiſe my juſt Concern for that Religion in which I have been ſo happily Educated, which my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment throughly convinces me to be beſt; and for the Support of which I am ſo highly intereſted in my Native Country?

            <p>I Have little to add to what his Highneſs has expreſs'd in general Terms, beſides laying before you the dangerous way you are at preſent in, where Ruin or Infamy muſt inevitably attend you, if you don't joyn with the <hi>Prince</hi> in the Common Cauſe, for the Defence of your Religion and Liberties; for ſhould it pleaſe God, for the ſins of the Engliſh Nation, to ſuffer your Arms to prevail, to what can your Victory ſerve you, but to enſlave you deeper, and overthrow the true Religion, in which you have liv'd, and your Fathers dy'd? Of which, I beg you, as a Friend, to conſider the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, and to reflect on the Blot and Infamy it will bring on you, not only now, but in all After-Ages, That by Your means the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> was deſtroy'd, and your Country depriv'd of its Ancient Liberties: And if it pleaſes God to bleſs the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Endeavours with ſucceſs, as I don't doubt but he will, conſider then what their Condition will be that oppoſe him in this ſo good a Deſign, where the greateſt Favour they can hope for, is, their being ſuffer'd to end their Days in Miſery and Want, deteſted and deſpiſed by all good Men.</p>
            <p>It is therefore, and for many more Reaſons, too long to inſert here, that I, as a true Engliſh-man and your Friend, exhort you to joyn your Arms to the <hi>Prince,</hi> for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Common Cauſe, the Proteſtant Religion, and the Liberties of your Country. It is what I am well aſſured the <hi>major</hi> and beſt part of the Army, as well as the Nation, will do ſo ſoon as convenience is offered. Prevent them in ſo good an Action whilſt it is in your power; and may it appear, That as the Kingdom hath always depended on the Navy for its Defence, ſo you will yet go further, by making it, as much as in you lies, the Protection of her Religion and Liberties; and then you may aſſure your ſelves of all Marks of Favour and Honour ſuitable to the Merits of ſo great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious an Action.

            <p>THE occaſion of this, is to give you my Thoughts upon the preſent Conjuncture, which concerns not only you, but every Proteſtant, and Free-born Man of <hi>England,</hi> I am confident, that wiſhes well to the Proteſtant Religion and his Country; and I am perſwaded that every Man of you thinks both in danger, and now to lie at ſtake. I am alſo perſwaded, that every Man of you will rejoyce to ſee Religion and Property ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled; if ſo, then I am not miſtaken in my Conjectures concerning you. Can you ever hope for a better Occaſion to root out <hi>POPERY</hi> and <hi>SLAVERY,</hi> than by joining with the <hi>P.</hi> of <hi>O.</hi> whoſe Propoſals contain and ſpeak the Deſires of every Man that loves his Religion and Liberty? And in ſaying this, I will invite you to nothing but what I will do my ſelf; and I will not deſire any of you to go any further than I will move my ſelf; neither will I put you upon any Danger where I will not take ſhare in it. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this to you, not as you are my Tenants, but as my Friends, and as you are <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
               <pb n="435" facs="tcp:48501:228"/>No Man can love Fighting for its own ſake, nor find any pleaſure in danger. And you may imagine, I would be very glad to ſpend the reſt of my days in peace, I having had ſo great a ſhare in Troubles; but I ſee all lies at ſtake, I am to chuſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I will be a <hi>Slave</hi> and a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> or a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and a <hi>Free man;</hi> and therefore the Caſe being thus, I ſhall think my ſelf falſe to my Country, if I ſit ſtill at this time. I am of Opinion, that when the Nation is Deliver'd, it muſt be by Force or by Miracle: It would be too great a preſumption to expect the latter, and therefore our Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance muſt be by Force, and I hope this is the Time for it; a Price is now put into our Hands, and if it miſcarry for want of Aſſiſtance, our Blood is upon our own Heads; and he that is paſſive at this Time, may very well expect that God will mock when the Fear of Affliction comes upon him, which he thought to avoid by being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.</p>
            <p>If the King prevails, farewel Liberty of Conſcience, which has hitherto been allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not for the ſake of the Proteſtants, but in order to ſettle Popery. You may ſee what to expect if he get the better; and he hath lately given you, of this Town, a taſte of the Method, whereby he will maintain his Army.

And (2.) Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s ſo ill obſerving her Promiſes to the <hi>Suffolk</hi>-men that help'd her to the Throne. And above all, (3.) the Popes diſpenſing with the breach of Oaths, Treaties, or Promiſes, at his pleaſure, when it makes for the ſervice of Holy Church, as they term it. Theſe, we ſay, are ſuch convincing Reaſons to hinder us from giving Credit to the aforeſaid <hi>Mock-Shews</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, that we think our ſelves bound in Conſcience to reſt on no Security that ſhall not be approved by a <hi>Freely Elected Parliament,</hi> to whom, under God, we refer our Cauſe.</p>

            <p>NOT doubting but you and the reſt of your Body, as well as the whole City and Country, may be Alarmed by the great Concourſe of Gentry, with the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Appearance of their Friends and Servants, as well as of your own <hi>Militia,</hi> here this Morning, I have thought this the moſt proper place, as being the moſt publick one, to give you an Account of our Intentions.</p>
            <p>Out of the deep ſenſe we had that in the preſent unhappy Juncture of Affairs, nothing we could think of was poſſible to ſecure the Laws, Liberties, and Proteſtant Religion, but a Free Parliament; WE ARE HERE MET TO DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLARE, That we will do our utmoſt to defend the ſame, by declaring for ſuch a Free Parliament.</p>
            <p>And ſince His Majeſty hath been pleaſed (by the News we hear this day) to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Writs for a Parliament to ſit the Fifteenth of <hi>January</hi> next, I can only add, in the name of my Self and all theſe Gentlemen, and others here met, That we will ever be ready to ſupport and defend the Laws, Liberties, and Proteſtant Religion. And ſo GOD SAVE THE KING.</p>
            <p>To this the Mayor, Aldermen, and the reſt of the Corporation, and a numerous Aſſembly, did concur with his Grace and the reſt of the Gentry.</p>
            <p>His Grace at his lighting from his Horſe, perceiving great numbers of Common People gathering together, called them to him, and told them, He deſired they would not take any occaſion to commit any Diſorder or Outrage, but go quietly to their Homes; and acquainted them that the King had ordered a Free Parliament to be called.</p>

Tho we have brought both a good Fleet, and a good Army, to render theſe Kingdoms happy, by reſcuing all Proteſtants from Popery, Slavery, and Arbitrary Power; by reſtoring them to their Rights and Properties eſtabliſhed by Law, and by promoting of Peace and Trade, which is the Soul of Government, and the very Life-Blood of a Nation; yet we rely more on the goodneſs of God and the Juſtice of our Cauſe, than on any Humane Force and Power whatever. Yet ſince God is pleaſed we ſhall make uſe of Human Means, and not expect Miracles, for our Preſervation and Happineſs; let us not neglect making uſe of this gracious Opportunity, but with Prudence and Courage put in Execution our ſo honourable Purpoſes. Therefore, Gentlemen, Friends and Fellow-Proteſtants, we bid you and all your Followers moſt heartily Welcom to our Court and Camp. Let the whole World now judg, if our Pretenſions are not Juſt, Generous, Sincere and above Price; ſince we might have even a Bridge of Gold to return back: But it is our Principle and Reſolution, rather to die in a good Cauſe, than live in a bad One, well knowing that Vertue and True Honour is its own Reward, and the Happineſs of Mankind Our Great and Only Deſign</p>

            <p>WE doubt not but the World believes that in this great and dangerous Conjunct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, we are heartily and zealouſly concerned for the Proteſtant Religion, the Laws of the Land, and the Liberties and Properties of the Subject.

            <p>THE King commanded us to acquaint You, That he obſerveth all the Differences and Cauſes of Complaint alledged by Your Highneſs ſeem to be referred to a Free Parliament.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty, as He hath already declared, was reſolved before this to call one, but thought that in the preſent State of Affairs it was adviſable to defer it till things were more compos'd.</p>
            <p>Yet ſeeing that His People ſtill continue to deſire it; He hath put forth His Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in order to it, and hath iſſued forth His Writs for the calling of it.</p>
            <p>And to prevent any Cauſe of Interruption in it, He will conſent to every thing that can be reaſonably required for the Security of all thoſe that ſhall come to it.</p>

               <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> the Ninth of <hi>January,</hi> they met at three of the Clock in the ſame Room, and Sir <hi>Patrick Hume</hi> took notice of the Propoſal made by the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know if there was any there that would ſecond it: But none appearing to do it, he ſaid, That what the Earl had propoſed, was evidently oppoſite and inimicous to his Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Undertaking, his Declaration, and the good Intentions of preſerving the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, and of Reſtoring their Laws
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:48501:233"/>and Liberties expreſt in it; and further, deſired that the Meeting ſhould declare this to be their Opinion of it. The Lord <hi>Cardroſs</hi> ſeconded Sir <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Motion: It was anſwered by the Duke of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Preſident of the <hi>Meeting,</hi> That their Buſineſs was to prepare an Advice to be offered to the Prince; and the Advice being now ready to go to the Vote, there was no need that the Meeting ſhould give their Senſe of the Earl's Propoſal, which neither before nor after Sir <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Motion, any had pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to own or ſecond; ſo that it was fallen and out of doors; and that the Vote of the Meeting, upon the Advice brought in by their Order, would ſufficiently declare their Opinion: This being ſeconded by the Earl of <hi>Sutherland,</hi> the Lord <hi>Cardroſs</hi> and Sir <hi>Patrick</hi> did acquieſce in it; and the Meeting Voted unanimouſly the Advice following.</p>

            <p>WE have received your Majeſties Letters, dated from St. <hi>Germans</hi> the ſixth of <hi>February</hi> laſt, by the Earl of <hi>Carlingford,</hi> your Envoy in our Court: By them we have underſtood the Condition your Majeſty is reduced to; and that you being deſerted after the Landing of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> by your Army, and even by your Domeſtick Servants, and by thoſe you moſt conſided in, and almoſt by all your Subjects, you have been forced by a ſudden Flight to provide for your own Safety, and to ſeek Shelter and Protection in <hi>France:</hi> Laſtly, that you deſire Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from us for the recovering your Kingdoms. We do aſſure your Majeſty, that as ſoon as we heard of this ſevere turn of Affairs, we were moved at it, not only with the common ſenſe of Humanity, but with much deeper Impreſſions ſuitable to the ſincere Affection which we have always born to you. And we were heartily ſorry that at laſt that was come to paſs, which (tho we hoped for better things) yet our own ſad thoughts had ſuggeſted to us would enſue. If your Majeſty had rather given Credit to the Friendly Remonſtrances that were made you, by our late Envoy, the Count de <hi>Kaunitz,</hi> in our Name, than the deceitful Inſinuations of the <hi>French,</hi> whoſe chief aim was, by fomenting continual Diviſions between you and your Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to gain thereby an Opportunity to inſult the more ſecurely over the reſt of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom: And if your Majeſty had put a ſtop, by your Force and Authority, to their many Infractions of the Peace, of which by the Treaty at <hi>Nimegen</hi> you are made the Guarantee, and to that end, entred into Conſultations with us, and ſuch others as have the like juſt Sentiments in this matter; We are verily perſuaded that by this means you ſhould have in a great meaſure quieted the Minds of your People, which were ſo much exaſperated through their averſion to our Religion, and the publick Peace had been preſerved as well in your Kingdoms as here in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. But now we refer it even to your Majeſty, to judg what condition we can be in to afford you any Aſſiſtance, we being not only Engaged in a War with the <hi>Turks,</hi> but finding our ſelves, at the ſame time unjuſtly and barbarouſly Attacked by the <hi>French,</hi> contrary to, and againſt the Faith of Treaties, they then reckoning themſelves ſecure of <hi>England.</hi> And <hi>this ought not to be concealed; that the greatest Injuries which have been done to our Religion have flowed from no other than the</hi> French <hi>themſelves; who not only eſteem it lawful for them, to make perfidious Leagues with the ſworn Enemies of the Holy Croſs, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the deſtruction both of us and of the whole Christian World,</hi> in order to the checking our Endeavours which were undertaken for the glory of God, and to ſtop thoſe Succeſſes which it hath pleaſed Almighty God to give us hitherto; <hi>but further have heaped one Treuchery upon another, even within the Empire it ſelf.</hi> The Cities of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire which were Surrendred upon Articles, ſigned by the <hi>Dauphin</hi> himſelf, have been exhauſted by exceſſive Impoſitions; and after their being exhauſted, have been Plundred, and after Plundring have been Burned and Razed. The Palaces of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which in all times, and even in the moſt deſtructive Wars, have been preſerved, are now burnt down to the ground. The Churches are Robbed, and ſuch as ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves to them are in a moſt Barbarous manner, carried away as Slaves. In ſhort, <hi>It is become a Diverſion to them to commit all manner of Inſolences and Cruelties in many places, but chiefly in Catholick Countries, exceeding the Cruelties of the</hi> Turks <hi>themſelves;</hi> which having impoſed an abſolute neceſſity upon us to ſecure our ſelves and the holy <hi>Roman</hi> Empire by the beſt means we can think on, and that no leſs againſt them than againſt the <hi>Turks;</hi> we promiſe our ſelves from your Juſtice ready aſſent to this, That it ought not to be imputed to us, if we endeavour to procure, by a juſt War, that ſecurity to our ſelves which we could not hitherto obtain by ſo many Treaties; and that in order to the obtaining thereof, we take meaſures for our mutual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Preſervation, with all thoſe who are equally concerned in the ſame Deſign with us. It remains that we beg of God that he would Direct all things to his glory, and that he would grant your Majeſty true and ſolid Comforts under this your great Calamity; we embrace you with tender Affections of a Brother.</p>

            <p n="10">10. By Impriſoning Perſons without expreſſing the Reaſon, and delaying to put them to Tryal.</p>
            <p n="11">11. By cauſing purſue and forfault ſeveral Perſons upon ſtretches of old and obſolete Laws, upon frivolous and weak pretences, upon lame and defective Probations; as particularly the late Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> to the ſcandal and reproach of the Juſtice of the Nation.</p>
            <p n="12">12. By Subverting the Right of the Royal Boroughs, the Third Eſtate of Parliament, impoſing upon them not only Magiſtrates, but alſo the whole Town Council and Clerks, contrary to the Liberties and expreſs Charters, without the pretence either of Sentence, Surrender or Conſent: So that the Commiſſioners to Parliaments being choſen by the Magiſtrates and Councils, the King might in effect as well nominate that entire Eſtate of Parliament; many of the ſaid Magiſtrates put in by him were avowed Papiſts; and the Burghs were forced to pay Mony for the Letters, impoſing theſe Illegal Magiſtrates and Council upon them.</p>

            <p>Therefore the Eſtates of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> find, and declare, That King <hi>James</hi> the Seventh, being a profeſt papiſt, did aſſume the Regal Power, and acted as a King, without ever taking the Oath required by Law; and have by advice of Evil and Wicked Counſellors invaded the Fundamental Conſtitution of the Kingdom, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered it from a Legal, limited Monarchy, to an Arbitrary and Deſpotick Power; and hath exerciſed the ſame to the ſubverſion of the Proteſtant Religion, and the violation of the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom: Inverting all the Ends of Government, whereby he hath forfaulted the Right to the Crown, and the Throne is become vacant.</p>

            <p>That the employing Officers of the Army as Judges through the Kingdom, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them where there were ſeveral Offices and Juriſdictions, and the putting the Lieges to death ſummarily, and without legal Tryal, Jury or Record, are contrary to Law.</p>
            <p>That the impoſing extraordinary Fines, the exacting of exorbitant Bail, and the diſpoſing of Fines and Forfaultures before Sentence, are contrary to Law.</p>
            <p>That the Impriſoning Perſons, without expreſſing the reaſon thereof, and delaying to put them to Tryal, are contrary to Law.</p>

            <p>That the fining Husbands for their Wives withdrawing from the Church, was contrary to Law.</p>
            <p>That Prelacy, and Superiority of any Office in the Church above Presbyters, is and hath been a great and unſupportable Grievance and Trouble to this Nation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Inclinations of the Generality of the People ever ſince the Reformation, they having Reformed from Popery by Presbyters, and therefore ought to be aboliſhed.</p>

If therefore I have met with any Thing that I think worthy of your Conſideration, I ſhould think my ſelf wanting in that duty which I owe to my Country and Mankind, if I ſhould not lay it before You.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>FIrſt,</hi> 'Tis neceſſary to diſtinguiſh between <hi>Power</hi> it ſelf, the <hi>Deſignation</hi> of the <hi>Perſons Governing,</hi> and the <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Government.</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. All Power is from God as the Fountain and Original.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Deſignation of the Perſons, and the Form of Government, is either, Firſt, immediately from God, as in the Caſe of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and the Government of the <hi>Jews;</hi> or, Secondly, from the Community, chuſing ſome Form of Government, and ſubjecting themſelves to it. But it muſt be noted, that though <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> had a Divine Deſignation, yet the People aſſembled; and in a General Aſſembly, by their Votes, freely choſe them: Which proves, that there can be no orderly or laſting Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, without Conſent of the People Tacit or Expreſs'd; and God himſelf would not put Men under a Government without their Conſent. And in caſe of a Conqueſt, the People may be called <hi>Priſoners</hi> or <hi>Slaves</hi> (which is a ſtate contrary to the Nature of Man) but they cannot be properly <hi>Subjects,</hi> till their Wills be brought to ſubmit to the Government: So that Conqueſt may <hi>make Way</hi> for a Government, but it cannot <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute</hi> it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is a <hi>Supreme Power</hi> in every Community, eſſential to it, and inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from it; by which, if it be not limited immediately by God, it can form it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any kind of Government. And in ſome extraordinary Occaſions, when the Safety and Peace of the Publick neceſſarily require it, can ſupply the Defects, reform the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes, and re-eſtabliſh the true Fundamentals of the Government; by Purging, Refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and bringing Things back to their firſt Original: Which Power may be called <hi>The Supreme Power Real.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When the Community has made choice of ſome Form of Government, and ſubjected themſelves to it, having inveſted ſome Perſon or Perſons with the <hi>Supreme Power:</hi> The Power in thoſe Perſons may be called, <hi>The Supream Power Perſonal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If this Form be a mix'd Government of <hi>Monarchy, Ariſtocracy</hi> and <hi>Democracy;</hi> and for the eaſie Execution of the Laws, the <hi>Executive Power</hi> be lodg'd in a <hi>ſingle Perſon;</hi> He has, <hi>a Supream Power Perſonal,</hi> quoad hoc.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The <hi>Supreme Power Perſonal of</hi> England, is in Kings, Lords and Commons; and ſo it was in Effect agreed to, by King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, in his Anſwer to the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Popoſitions; and reſolved by the Convention of the Lords and Commons in the year 1660. And note, That the Acts of that Convention, tho' never confirmed by Parliament have been taken for Law, and particularly by the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The <hi>Supreme Power Perſonal</hi> of <hi>England</hi> fails three Ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis diſſolved: For two Eſſential Parts fail. 1. a King. 2. a Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; which cannot be called according to Conſtitution, the King being gone, and the Freedom of Election being deſtroyed by the Kings Incroachments.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The King has forfeited his Power ſeveral Ways. Subjection to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> is the Subjection againſt which our Laws cry loudeſt: And even <hi>Barclay</hi> (that Monarchical Politician) acknowledges, That if a King alienate his Kingdom, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it to another, he forfeits it. And <hi>Grotius</hi> aſſerts, That if a King really attempt to deliver up or ſubject his Kingdom, he may be therein reſiſted: And that, if the King have part of the <hi>Supreme Power,</hi> and the People or Senate the other part, (the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:48501:239"/>that part which is not his) a juſt Force may be oppoſed, and he may loſe his Part of the Empire. <hi>Grotius de Bello,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Cap.</hi> 72. But that the King has <hi>ſubjected the Kingdom to the Pope,</hi> needs no Proof; That he has <hi>uſurp'd an abſolute Power ſuperieur to all Laws;</hi> made the Peoples Share in the Legiſlative Power impertinent and uſeleſs, and thereby invaded their juſt Rights, none can deny. 'Twere in vain to multiply Inſtances of his Forfeitures: And, if we conſider the Power exercis'd by him of late, it will moſt evidently appear to all who underſtand the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitution, that it admits of no ſuch King, nor any ſuch Power.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The King has deſerted,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) By incapacitating himſelf by a Religion inconſiſtent with the Fundamentals of our Government.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) By forſaking the Power the Conſtitution allow'd him, and uſurping a Foreign one: So that tho the Perſon remained, the King was gone long ago.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) By Perſonal Withdrawing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The <hi>Supreme Power Real</hi> remains in the Community; and they may act by their Original Power: And tho every Particular Perſon is, notwithſtanding ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, Forfeiture, or Deſertion, ſubject to the Laws which were made by the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power Perſonal,</hi> when in Being; yet the Communities Power is not bound by them, but is paramount all Laws made by the <hi>Supreme Power Perſonal:</hi> And has a full Right to take ſuch Meaſures for Settling the Government, as they ſhall think moſt ſure and effectual, for the laſting Security and Peace of the Nation. For we muſt note, that it was the Community of <hi>England,</hi> which firſt gave Being to both King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and to all the other Parts of our Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> The <hi>moſt Renowned Politician</hi> obſerves, That thoſe Kingdoms and Republicks ſubſiſt longeſt that are often renewed, or brought back to their firſt Beginnings; which is an Obſervation of Self-evident Truth, and implies, That the <hi>Supreme Power Real</hi> has a Right to renew, or bring back. And the moſt-ingenious <hi>Lawſon</hi> obſerves (in his <hi>Politica</hi>) That the Community of <hi>England,</hi> in the late Times, had the greateſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that they or their Anceſtors had had for many Ages, for this purpoſe; tho God hid it from their Eyes: But the wonderful Concurrence of ſuch a ſeries of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, as we now ſee and admire, gives ground to hope, That the Veil is removed, and the Nation will now ſee the Things that concern their Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly,</hi> The Acts done and executed by the <hi>Supreme Power Perſonal</hi> (when in Being) have ſo modell'd the Parts and Perſons of the Community, that the Original Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the beſt, juſteſt, and the moſt deſirable. The <hi>Royal Family</hi> affords a Perſon that both Heaven and Earth point out for King. There are Lords, whoſe Nobility is not affected by the Diſſolution of the Government, and are the ſubject Matter of a Houſe of Lords; And there are Places, which by Cuſtom or Charter have Right to chooſe Repreſentatives of the Commons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tenthly,</hi> There are inextricable Difficulties in all other Methods. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is no Demiſe of the King, neither Civil nor Natural.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is conſequently no Deſcent.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Community only has a Right to take Advantage of the King's Forfeiture or Deſertion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whatever other Power may be imagin'd in the two Houſes, as Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, it cannot juſtify it ſelf to the Reaſon of any, who underſtand the Bottom of our Conſtitution.</p>
            <p n="5">5. By this Method all <hi>Popiſh Succeſſors</hi> may be excluded; and the Government ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, in caſe all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of the Family die without Iſſue: And this by the very Conſtitution of <hi>England.</hi> And the Queſtion can never ariſe about the Force or the Lawfulneſs of a Bill of Excluſion.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Convention will not be oblig'd to take Oaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> If theſe things be granted, and the Community be at Liberty to act as above; it will certainly be moſt adviſable, not only for the Security and Welfare of the Nation, but (if rightly underſtood) for the Intereſt of their Royal Highneſſes, to limit the Crown as follows:—To the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> during his Life (yet with all poſſible Honour and Reſpect to the Princeſs, whoſe Intereſts and Inclinations are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably the ſame with his) Remainder to the Princeſs of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the Heirs of her Body; Remainder to the Princeſs of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and the Heirs of her Body; Remainder to the Heirs of the Body of the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> Remainder as an Act of Parliament ſhall appoint.</p>
            <p>This will have theſe Conveniences among others.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Husband and Wife are but one Perſon in Law, and her Husbands Honour is hers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It puts the preſent Kingly Power into the beſt Hand in the World; which (without Flattery) is agreed on by all Men.</p>
            <pb n="457" facs="tcp:48501:239"/>
            <p n="3">3. It aſſerts the above ſaid Power in the Community.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It will be ſome Acknowledgment to the Prince for what he has done for the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And it is worthy Obſervation, that before the <hi>Theocracy</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> ceaſed, the manner of the Divine Deſignation of their Judges, was by God's giving the People ſome Deliverance by the hand of the Perſon, to whoſe Government they ought to ſubmit; and this even in that time of extraordinary Revelations. Thus <hi>Othniel, Gideon, Jephthah, Sampſon,</hi> and others were inveſted by Heaven with the Supreme Authority: And though <hi>Joſhua</hi> had an immediate Command from God to ſucceed <hi>Moſes,</hi> and an Anointing to that purpoſe, by the laying on of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Hands: Yet the Foundation of the People's Submiſſion to him was laid in <hi>Jordan.</hi> And I challenge the beſt Hiſtorians to give an Inſtance (ſince that <hi>Theocracy</hi> ceaſed) of a Deſignation of any Perſon to any Government more viſibly Divine than that which we now admire. If the Hand of Providence (miraculouſly and timely diſpoſing Natural Things, in every Circumſtance to the beſt advantage) ſhould have any influence upon Mens Minds; moſt certainly we ought not here to be inſenſible. If <hi>the Voice of the People be the Voice of God,</hi> it never ſpoke louder: If a Nation of various Opinions, Intereſts and Factions, from a turbulent and fluctuating State, falls into a ſerene and quiet Calm, and Mens Minds are ſtrangely united on a ſudden; it ſhews from whence they are influenced. In a word, if the Hand of God is to be ſeen in Human Affairs, and his Voice to be heard upon Earth; we cannot any where (ſince the ceaſing of Miracles) find a clearer and more remarkable Inſtance, than is to be obſerv'd in the preſent Revolution. If one examines the Poſture of Foreign Affairs, making way for the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Expedition by ſome ſudden Events and Occurrences, which no Human Wiſdom or Power could have brought about; if one obſerves that Divine Influence which has directed all his Counſels, and crown'd his Undertakings, notwithſtanding ſuch innumerable Dangers and Difficulties, with conſtant Honour and Succeſs: If one conſiders how happily and wonderfully both Perſons and Things are changed in a little time, and without Blood; it looks like ſo many marks of God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, by which he thinks fit to point him out to us in this extraordinary Conjuncture.</p>
            <p>I will trouble you but with one Conſideration more; which is, That the two things moſt neceſſary in this Affair, are Unanimity and Diſpatch: For without both theſe your Counſels will have little Effect. In moſt things 'tis good to be long in reſolving; but in ſome 'tis fatal not to conclude immediately: And preſence of Mind is as great a Vertue, as Raſhneſs is a Vice. For the turns of Fortune are ſometimes ſo quick, that if Advantage be not taken in the critical hour, 'tis for ever loſt. But, I hope, your Lordſhips, and all thoſe Gentlemen who compoſe this Auguſt Aſſembly, will proceed with ſo much Zeal and Harmony, that the Reſult of your preſent Conſultations may be a laſting and grateful Monument to Poſterity, of your Integrity, Courage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>

               <hi>The Late</hi> Honourable Convention <hi>proved a</hi> Legal Parliament.</head>
            <p n="1">I. THE neceſſity of a Parliament agreed by the Lords and Commons Voting that the Throne is Vacant; for there being a Vacancy, there follows an immediate neceſſity of ſetling the Government, eſpecially the Writs being deſtroyed, and the Great Seal carried away, put a period to all publick Juſtice, and then there muſt be a ſupply by ſuch means as the neceſſity requires, or a failure of Government.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Conſider the Antecedents to the calling the Convention; that is, about three hundred of the Commons. which is a majority of the fulleſt Houſe that can be made, above ſixty Lords, being a greater number, than any part divided amounted to at this great Meeting, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council of the City of <hi>London,</hi> by application to His then Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> deſired him to accept of the Adminiſtration of Publick Affairs, Military and Civil, which he was pleaſed to do, to the great ſatisfaction of all good People, and after that His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was deſired to Iſſue forth his Circular Letters to the Lords; and the like to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roners, and in their abſence to the Clerks of the Peace, to Elect Knights, Citizens and Burgeſſes; this was more than was done in fifty nine, for the calling a Parliament in <hi>April</hi> 1660. for there the Summons was not real, but fictitious <hi>(i. e.)</hi> in the names of the Keepers of the Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> a meer Notion ſet up as a Form, there being no ſuch Perſons, but a meer <hi>Ens rationis,</hi> impoſſible really to exiſt: ſo that here was much more done than in 1659, and all really done which was poſſible to be invented, as the Affairs then ſtood. Beſides King <hi>Charles</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. had not abdicated the Kingdom, but was willing to return, and was at <hi>Breda,</hi> whither they might have ſent for Writs, and in
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:48501:240"/>the mean time have kept their form of Keepers of the Liberties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in the preſent caſe there was no King in being, nor any ſtyle or form of Government, neither real, or notional left; ſo that in all theſe reſpects, more was done before, and at the calling of this Great Convention, than for calling that Parliament (for ſo I muſt call it) yet that Parliament made ſeveral Acts, in all thirty ſeven, as appears by <hi>Keebles</hi> Statutes, and ſeveral of them not confirmed; I ſhall inſtance but in one, but it is one which there was occaſion to uſe in every County of <hi>England;</hi> I mean the Act for Confirming and Reſtoring Miniſters, being the 17th. of that Seſſions, all the Judges allowed of this as an Act of Parliament, tho never confirmed, which is a ſtronger caſe than that in queſtion; for there was only fictitious Summons, here a real one.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That without the Conſent of any Body of the People; this at the Requeſt of a Majority of the Lords, more than half the number of the Commons duly choſen in King <hi>Ch.</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. time, beſides the great Body of the City of <hi>London</hi> being at leaſt eſteem'd a 5th part of the Kingdom; yet after the King's Return, he was ſo well ſatisfied with the calling of that Parliament, that it was Enacted by the King, Lords and Commons Aſſembled in Parliament; that the Lords and Commons then Sitting at <hi>Weſtmiuſter</hi> in the preſent Parliament, were the two Houſes of Parliament, notwithſtanding any want of the Kings Writs or Writ of Summons, or any defect whatſoever; and as if the King had been preſent at the beginning of the Parliament; this I take to be a full Judgment in full Parliament of the caſe in queſtion, and much ſtronger than the preſent caſe is, and this Parliament continued till the 29th. of <hi>December</hi> next following, and made in all thirty ſeven Acts, as abovementioned.</p>
            <p>The 13 <hi>Caroli</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 7. (a full Parliament called by the Kings Writ) recites the other of 12 <hi>Caroli</hi> 2. and that after his Majeſties return they were continued till the 29th. of <hi>December,</hi> and then diſſolved, and that ſeveral Acts paſſed; this is the plain Judgment of another Parliament.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe it ſays they were continued, which ſhews they had a real being capable of being continued; for a Confirmation of a void Grant has no effect, and Confirmation ſhews a Grant only voidable, ſo the continuance there ſhewed it at moſt but voidable; and when the King came, and confirm'd it, all was good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The diſſolving it then, ſhews they had a being, for, as <hi>ex nihilo nihil fit,</hi> ſo <hi>ſuper nihil nil operatur,</hi> as out of nothing nothing can be made, ſo upon nothing nothing can operate.</p>
            <p>Again, the King, Lords and Commons, make the great Corporation or Body of the Kingdom, and the Commons are legally taken for the Free-holders, <hi>Inſt.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 2. Now the Lords and Commons having Proclaimed the King, the defect of this great Corporation is cured, and all the Eſſential parts of this great Body Politique united and made compleat, as plainly as when the Mayor of a Corporation dies, and another is choſen, the Corporation is again perfect; and to ſay, that which perfects the great Body Politique ſhould in the ſame inſtant deſtroy it, I mean the Parliament, is to make contradictions true, <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel,</hi> the perfection, and deſtruction of this great Body at one inſtant, and by the ſame Act.</p>
            <p>Then if neceſſity of Affairs was a forcible Argument in 1660, a time of great peace, not only in <hi>England,</hi> but throughout <hi>Europe,</hi> and almoſt in all the World; certainly 'tis of a greater force now, when <hi>England</hi> is ſcarce delivered from Popery and Slavery; when <hi>Ireland</hi> has a mighty Army of Papiſts, and that Kingdom in hazard of final deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, if not ſpeedily prevented; and when <hi>France</hi> has deſtroyed moſt of the Proteſtants there, and threatens the ruine of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> from whence God has ſent the wonderful Aſſiſtance of our Gracious, and therefore moſt Glorious King; and <hi>England</hi> cannot promiſe ſafety from that Foreign Power, when forty days delay, which is the leaſt can be for a new Parliament, and conſidering we can never hope to have one more freely choſen, becauſe firſt it was ſo free from Court-influence, or likelihood of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, that the Letters of Summons iſſued by him, whom the great God in infinite Mercy raiſed to ſave us, to the hazard of his Life, and this done to protect the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion and at a time when the people were all concerned for one Common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Religion, and Liberty, it would be vain when we have the beſt King and Queen the World affords, a full houſe of Lords, the moſt ſolemnly choſen Commons that ever were in the remembrance of any Man Living, to ſpend Money and loſe time (I had almoſt ſaid to deſpiſe Providence) and take great pains to deſtroy our ſelves.</p>
            <p>If any object Acts of Parliament mentioning Writs and Summons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>I anſwer, the Prededent in 1660 is after all thoſe Acts.</p>
            <p>In private caſes as much as has been done in point of neceſſity; a Biſhop Provincial dies, and <hi>ſede vacant</hi> a Clerk is preſented to a Benefice, the Preſentation to the Dean and Chapter is good in this caſe of Neceſſity; and if in a Vacancy by the Death of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:48501:240"/>a Preſentation ſhall be good to the Dean and Chapter, rather than a prejudice ſhould happen by the Church lying void; Surely <hi>a fortiori</hi>—Vacancy of the Throne may be ſupplied without the formality of a Writ, and the great Convention turn'd to a Real Parliament.</p>
            <p>A Summons in all points is of the ſame real force as a Writ, for a Summons and a Writ differ no more than in name, the thing is the ſame in all Subſtantial parts; the Writ is Recorded in Chancery, ſo are His Highneſſes Letters; the proper Officer En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſes the Return, ſo he does here (for the Coroner in defect of the Sheriff is the proper Officer) the People Chooſe by Virtue of the Letters, <hi>&amp;c. &amp; quae re concordant parum differunt,</hi> they agree in Reality, and then what difference is there between the one and the other?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> A Writ muſt be in Actions at Common Law, elſe all Pleading after, will not make it good, but Judgment given may be Reverſed by a Writ of Error.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The caſe differs, firſt, becauſe Actions between party and party, are Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Actions, but Summons to Parliament are not ſo, but are Mediums only to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n Election.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In Actions at Law the Defendant may plead to the Writ, but there is no plea to a Writ for electing Members to ſerve in Parliament; and for this I have <hi>Littleton's</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; there never was ſuch a Plea, therefore none lies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> That they have not taken the Teſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They may take the Teſt yet, and then all which they do will be good, for the Teſt being the diſtinguiſhing Mark of a Proteſtant from a Papiſt, when that is taken, the end of the Law is performed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> That the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy ought to be taken, and that the new ones are not legal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Convention being the Supream Power, have aboliſh'd the old Oaths, and have made new ones; and as to the making new Oaths, the like was done in <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freds</hi> time, when they choſe him King, <hi>vide</hi> Mirror of Juſtice. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. for the Heptar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy being turn'd to a Monarchy, the precedent Oaths of the ſeven Kings could not be the ſame King <hi>Alfred</hi> ſwore.</p>
            <p>Many Precedents may be cited, where Laws have been made in Parliament, without the King's Writ to ſummon them, which for brevity's ſake I forbear to mention.</p>
            <p>For a farewel, the Objections quarrel at our Happineſs, fight againſt our Safety, and aim at that which may indanger Deſtruction.</p>

            <head>The Preſent Convention, a Parliament.</head>
            <p n="1">I. THat the formality of the Kings Writ of Summons is not ſo eſſential to an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Parliament, but that the Peers of the Realm, and the Commons, by their Repreſentatives duly Elected, may legally act as the great Council and repreſentative Body of the Nation, though not ſummoned by the King, eſpecially when the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the time are ſuch, that ſuch Summons cannot be had, will (I hope) appear by theſe following Obſervations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>Saxon</hi> Government was tranſplanted hither out of <hi>Germany,</hi> where the meeting of the <hi>Saxons</hi> in ſuch Aſſemblies was at certain fixed times; <hi>viz.</hi> at the New and Full Moon. But after their Tranſmigration hither, Religion changing, other things changed with it; and the times for their publick Aſſemblies, in conformity to the great Solemnities celebrated by Chriſtians, came to be changed to the Feaſts of <hi>Eaſter, Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt,</hi> and the <hi>Nativity.</hi> The lower we come down in Story, the ſeldomer we find theſe General Aſſemblies to have been held; and ſometimes (even very anciently) when upon extraordinary occaſions, they met out of courſe, a <hi>Precept,</hi> an <hi>Edict,</hi> or <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> is mentioned to have Iſſued from the King: But the Times, and the very place of their ordinary Meeting having been certain, and determined in the very firſt and eldeſt times that we meet with any mention of ſuch Aſſemblies, which times are as ancient as any Memory of the Nation it ſelf; hence I infer, that no Summons from the King can be thought to have been neceſſary in thoſe days, becauſe it was altogether needleſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Succeſſion to the Crown did not in thoſe days, nor till of late years, run in a courſe of Lineal Succeſſion by right of Inheritance: But upon the death of a Prince, thoſe Perſons of the Realm that Compoſed the then Parliament, Aſſembled in order to the chooſing of another. That the Kingdom was then Elective, though one
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:48501:241"/>or other of the Royal Blood was always choſen, but the next in Lineal Succeſſion very ſeldom, is evident from the Genealogies of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings, from an old Law made at <hi>Calchuyth,</hi> appointing how, and by whom Kings ſhall be choſen; and from many expreſs and particular Accounts given by our old Hiſtorians, of ſuch Aſſemblies held for Electing of Kings. Now ſuch Aſſemblies could not be Summon'd by any King; and yet in conjunction with the King that themſelves ſet up, they made Laws, binding the King and all the Realm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> After the Death of King <hi>William Rufus, Robert,</hi> his Elder Brother, being then in the <hi>Holy Land, Henry,</hi> the younger Son of King <hi>William</hi> the Firſt, procured an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Clergy and People of <hi>England,</hi> to whom he made large Promiſes of his good Government, in caſe they would accept of him for their King; and they agreeing, that if he would reſtore to them the Laws of King <hi>Edward the Confeſſor,</hi> then they would conſent to make him their King: He ſwore that he would do ſo, and alſo free them from ſome oppreſſions, which the Nation had groan'd under in his Brothers and his Fathers time. Hereupon they choſe him King, and the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and the Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> ſet the Crown upon his Head: Which being done, a Confirmation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberties paſſed the Royal Aſſent in that Aſſembly, the ſame in ſubſtance, though not ſo large as King <hi>John</hi>'s, and King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third's <hi>Magna Charta</hi>'s afterwards were.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> After that King's Death, in ſuch another Parliament, King <hi>Stephen</hi> was E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and <hi>Mawd</hi> the Empreſs put by, though not without ſome ſtain of perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon all thoſe, and <hi>Stephen</hi> himſelf eſpecially, who had ſworn in her Fathers Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, to acknowledge her for their Soveraing after his deceaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> In King <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt's time, the King being abſent in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> then his Chancellor, being Regent of the Kingdom in his Abſence, whoſe Government was intolerable to the People for his Inſolence and manifold Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, a Parliament was convened at <hi>London,</hi> at the Inſtance of Earl <hi>John,</hi> the Kings Brother, to treat of the great and weighty affairs of the King and Kingdom; in which Parliament this ſame Regent was depos'd from his Government, and another ſet up, <hi>viz.</hi> the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Roan</hi> in his ſtead. This Aſſembly was not conven'd by the King, who was then in <hi>Palaeſtine,</hi> nor by any Authority deriv'd from him, for then the Regent and Chancellor muſt have call'd them together; but they met, as the Hiſtorian ſays expreſly, at the Inſtance of Earl <hi>John.</hi> And yet, in the Kings Abſence, they took upon them to ſettle the publick Affairs of the Nation without Him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> When King <hi>Henry</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. died, his Eldeſt Son, Prince <hi>Edward</hi> was then in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> and came not home till within the third year of his Reign; yet, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon the Fathers Death, all the Prelates and Nobles, and 4 Knights for every Shire, and 4 Burgeſſes for every Borough, Aſſembled together in a great Council and ſetled the Government till the King ſhould return: Made a new Seal, and a Chancellor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I infer from what has been ſaid, that Writs of Summons are not ſo Eſſential to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Parliaments, but that the People of <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially at a time when they cannot be had, may by Law, and according to our old Conſtitution Aſſemble together in a Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amentary way without them, to treat of and ſettle the publick Affairs of the Nation. And that, if ſuch Aſſemblies ſo conven'd, find the Throne Vacant, they may proceed not only to ſet up a Prince, but with the Aſſent and Concurrence of ſuch Prince, to tranſact all Publick buſineſs whatſoever, without a new Election; they having as great Authority as the People of <hi>England</hi> can deligate to their Repreſentatives.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Acts of Parliaments not Formal nor Legal in all their Circumſtances, are yet binding to the Nation ſo long as they continue in Force, and not liable to be queſtioned as to the Validity of them, but in ſubſequent Parliaments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The two <hi>Spencers, Temp. Edvardi Secundi,</hi> were baniſhed by Act of Parliament, and that Act of Parliament repealed by <hi>Dures &amp; Force;</hi> yet was the Act of Repeal a good Law, till it was Annulled 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Some Statutes of 11 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. and attainders thereupon were repealed in a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament held, <hi>Ann.</hi> 21. of that King, which Parliament was procured by forced Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and yet the Repeal ſtood good, till ſuch time as in 1 <hi>Henry</hi> 4. the Statutes of 11 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. were revived and appointed to be firmly held and kept.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Parliament of 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. conſiſted of the ſame Knights. Citizens and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes that had ſerved in the then laſt diſſolved Patliament, and thoſe Perſons were by the Kings Writts to the Sheriffs commanded to be returned, and yet they paſſed Acts; and their Acts tho never confirmed, continue to be Laws at this day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Parliament that reſtored the Popes Supremacy, was notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly known to be pack'd, inſo much that it was debated in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, whether or no to declare all their Acts void by Act of Parliament. That courſe was
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:48501:241"/>then upon ſome prudential conſiderations declined; and therefore the Acts of that Parliament, not ſince repealed, continue binding Laws to this day.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of all this, is, Becauſe no inferiour Courts have Authority to judge of the Validity or Invalidity of the Acts of ſuch Aſſemblies, as have but ſo much as a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Parliamentary Authority.</p>
            <p>The Acts of ſuch Aſſemblies being Entred upon the Parliament-Roll, and certified before the Judges of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> as Acts of Parliament, are concluſive and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them; becauſe Parliaments are the only Judges of the Imperfections, Invalidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Illegalities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of one another.</p>
            <p>The Parliament that call'd in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, was not aſſembled by the Kings Writ, and yet they made Acts, and the Royal aſſent was had to them; many of which indeed were afterwards confirmed, but not all, and thoſe that had no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, are undoubted Acts of Parliament without it, and have ever ſince obtained as ſuch.</p>
            <p>Hence I inferr that the preſent Convention, may, if they pleaſe, aſſume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a Parliamentary Power, and in conjunction with ſuch King or Queen as they ſhall declare, may give Laws to the Kingdom as a legal Parliament.</p>

               <head>The Thoughts of a Private <hi>Perſon,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
               <p>MEn have three Rules to walk by, which we may call Laws, that is, <hi>Nature, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and <hi>Religion;</hi> and anſwerable to theſe three a Chriſtian hath three Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that is, <hi>Senſitive, Rational,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual,</hi> which I take to be the diſtinction that St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. <hi>I pray God your whole Spirit, Soul and Body, be preſerved blameleſs unto the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nature</hi> conſiders all Men as ſingle Perſons, and directs them to Self-intereſt and Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſervation, as the chief end. <hi>Reaſon</hi> conſiders Men as ſociable Creatures, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects them to unite the Government for the publick Good (incluſive of their own Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) as the chief End. And the <hi>Spirit</hi> conſiders Men as Candidates for Heaven, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects them to live according to the Word of God, that they may attain Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the chief End of Man. All theſe have the divine Warrant, and are of force where the Lower is not ſuperſeded by the Higher. A ſingle Perſon is not to expoſe himſelf to ruin, unleſs it be for the Publick good; and the Publick are not to expoſe themſelves to Beggary and Slavery, unleſs it be for the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Now though theſe Rules may be conſidered ſeparate, and apart, yet they all ought to be in a Chriſtian Government. Laws for the publick Good do not deſtroy the Law of Nature, but ſuperſede it for a greater Good; and the Laws of God do not deſtroy the Law of Reaſon, but ſuperſede it for a higher end, and ſo makes it ſtill more Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to do ſo. Nothing therefore can juſtifie a Private Injury but the Publick Good, and nothing can hinder the Publick Good for being carried on but Sin. For theſe Laws are not deſtructive but ſupportive of one another, and all ſupportive of Man. When a Man cannot defend himſelf, by the Method and Meaſures of the Publick, (as in caſe of ſudden Aſſaults) he may by the Law of Nature, break the Peace and ſmite his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſave his own life, becauſe humane Laws can reward no Perſon's obedience with ſo good a thing as life, and therefore, the publick good excepted, his life is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before all forms of Law. But it is not ſo with the Laws of God; for if I be urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deny my Faith, or dye, I muſt dye rather than break God's Law, becauſe God will give me a better Life, and an infinite Reward. Neceſſity can ſuſpend a poſitive Law of Man, that is merely ſuch, but it cannot ſuperſede what is eſtabliſhed by God or Nature; an Act therefore that is civilly Unlawful, may notwithſtanding be Lawful, becauſe it is not Lawleſs, but under a more extenſive Law. If it be according to the Laws of God, or ſound Reaſon, the Conſcience is ſafe, and the Act commendable before God and good Men, though it be againſt the form of Political Law: For though it be againſt the Form, it is not againſt the Reaſon of that Law; and the Form not being extenſive enough of Man's ſafety, it muſt give place to neceſſity, and abſolve him of his duty, when his duty would deſtroy him.</p>
               <p>The Safety of Man ſhows us both the Neceſſity and End of humane Government; for when private Perſons found they could not be Safe, they were willing to enter into Compacts and Aſſociations, and repoſite their private Safety in the publick Intereſt: And therefore if after this Aſſociation ſome of their Fellows will break the Covenants, and go about to deſtroy the Reſt, it is lawful, both by the Laws of God and Man, for the injured to defend themſelves; and by the Laws and Compacts by them made, and conſented to, on both ſides, for the publick Good. Otherwiſe it would be unlawful to reſiſt Injuſtice, and conſequently a Thief or a Robber.</p>
               <div n="1" type="objection">
                  <p>Object. 1. <hi>But you will ſay in all Governments there are Superiours and Inferiours, and God has made Obedience a part of Religion, and conſequently conducive to a higher end than the Publick Good; and therefore if the Governours break the Laws, and introduce a Publick Evil for a Private Intereſt, they muſt not be reſiſted upon pain of Damnation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This were a good Plea, if it were true, but God is not the Patron of Injuſtice; and therefore he gives no Prince or Potentate more Authority over the People than the Tables of the Government expreſs, and of theſe there are diverſe degrees. Thoſe that are Govern'd by the will of their Prince, whoſe Word is a Law, if he command their Perſons for Slaves, or Eſtates to ſerve his Ambition, they muſt obey, and God requires it of them, becauſe it is the Princes Right. Arbitrary Princes have a Political Power to treat a Subject cruelly and inhumanely; their Immorality is an offence againſt God not injuſtice to the Subject who had given up himſelf to be uſed at their diſcretion. But thoſe that are to rule by Laws made for the Publick good, and ſuch as render the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Freemen, not Slaves; ſuch as ſecures their Religion, Liberty and Property; if theſe
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:48501:242"/>Princes contrary to Law impriſon their perſons, or ſeize their Eſtates, they do it unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without God's Warrant, or any Political Authority, and may be reſiſted, or elſe we might not reſiſt the Devil, ſhould he creep into the Court in a Jeſuits habit, and <hi>Haman</hi>-like, get a Commiſſion to cut all our Throats.</p>
                  <p>If I be called to ſuffer for my Religion, or the Faith of Chriſt, I am bound to ſuffer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a mighty reaſonable account: For firſt, It is the beſt way to overcome, my Faith can Triumph ſo by no other Victory as by Death, for that is a Victory never to be loſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. 2. Though I die, the Tyrant hath not his end, but is by that means utterly defeated of it. And 3. I ſhall be an infinite gainer by it, for I ſhall have an infinite Reward for what I ſuffer, and what I loſe. But there is a vaſt difference between ſuffering for the Faith of Chriſt, and for the frame of a Political Government; for if I may not reſiſt I am overcome. 2. If I am overcome, the Tyrantgets his End; namely, an Arbitrary Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And 3. He has promis'd no Reward for ſuch Voluntary entering into Bondage, or owning an uſurped Authority. The Church and the frame of the State ſtand upon Two ſeveral Bottoms, God has promiſed to ſupport the Church, and there needs no Arm of fleſh to defend it under the worſt of governments: But the frame of every govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a Humane Structure; and though God does impower and authorize every go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, yet he has left the Choice of the ſeveral kinds to the parties, and has promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bleſs them in the juſt Adminiſtration of their ſeveral Choices; but no where has he promiſed to ſupport the particular frame they choſe, that as their prudence raiſed it, or it muſt fall at every King's pleaſure, and when they have choſen out the Frame, God that approves it, grants neither the King nor the people greater priviledges than the Frame it ſelf expreſſes, which in diverſe Nations is different, ſome ſubmitting to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the will of him they Voluntarily choſe. Others to one that will govern by Laws of their own making, and his approving. Others to one of their precedent Kings Race or Line. Others to a multitude.

                     </gap> he therefore that reſiſteth the government, proceedeth according to the Frame of thegovernment, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God. But if the Governor proceed neither according to the Frame of the government, nor to the End, but againſt it, ſuch Proceſs cannot be the Ordinance of God, unleſs God have two contradictory Ordinances of Force, at one time in the ſame Government, and then the command may be true and falſe, and the Subjects duty good and evil, and men would be perpetually diſtracted with ſerving two Maſters. This would make the Government God's and the Devil's, and as no leſs than to put a Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Juggle upon the Ordinance of God: which is always ſimple, and at one with it ſelf. Theſe Scriptures therefore can tye us to obey the Governor contrary to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, becauſe they tye us to obey the government; and that this is all they tye us from reſiſting, is evident by the Reaſon St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives, which is, <hi>becauſe the Reſiſters reſiſt the Ordinance of God;</hi> and therefore it is warily expreſt, if it were but as warily read, for it is not whoſoever reſiſteth the perſon or the will of the Governor, but whoſoever reſiſteth the Power (and that Power is neither more nor leſs than the Frame of the government expreſſes) reſiſteth the Ordinance of God, and to this Reſiſtance the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty is annexed.</p>

For I would fain know of the Doctors of Non reſiſtance, whether the Act that contains the Teſt, have the ſtamp of God's Authority upon it or no; if it have not, the Power of the King and Parliament is no Power of God; if it have, then to reſiſt, that is to reſiſt the Ordinance of God: And thoſe Commiſſions that are contrary to it, have no power from God: If the affirmative be true the negative is of no force.

Which being utterly impoſſible, it muſt be concluded, That the reſiſting ſuch Commiſſions, and the Inſtruments acting by them, is not to reſiſt Lawful Authority, but to remove Unlawful; not to do evil, but to hinder it; not to ſin, but to prevent Sinners for doing miſchief; and it would be very hard meaſure for a Man to be damn'd for doing ſuch a good Office.

<pb n="465" facs="tcp:48501:243"/>he muſt be Arbitrary, and we Slaves, and all our Laws muſt be acts of Grace, not Fundamental Rights: Not from any inherent power reſerved at the Inſtitution to our ſelves, and never ſubmitted to the Princes; but from the gracious condeſcention of an Abſolute Monarch, which is contrary to the Story of all times, which ſhows that the people ever claimed Liberty and Property, according to their Ancient Laws and Cuſtoms, not as a Gift, but as a Right inherent in themſelves, and never Transferred, Aliened, or Conveyed to any King, but Declared. Recognized and Confirmed to them by many.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore ſuppoſe (what I think none can upon ſufficient grounds deny) that the King is bound by all the ſacred Tyes of God and Man, to govern by the Laws, and not otherwiſe, neither by a Foreign Law, nor by one of his own framing, nor by any Word or Will contrary to Law, ſeeing nothing can have the force of Law here, but what has the joynt Conſent of King and Parliament, and that in a Parliamentary way, and this ſhows us in the Terms of Submiſſion that are ſworn to on both ſides. The King and the people by a joynt conſent makes Laws, and make them the common Rule betwixt them, the King ſwears to obſerve the Laws, and the people ſwear to obey the King, and to leave the Execution of the Laws to the King to be managed for the publick good.</p>
                  <p>Therefore as long as he governs by Law, he and all his Miniſters are ſafe enough from Reſiſtance, the Reſiſter being lyable to be puniſhed both by God and Man; and the ſole adminiſtration being left to the King, Subjects all but himſelf to Criminal proceſs, and even himſelf to Civil, but his perſon and power are ſafe in both, he may be ſevere in the Execution of the Laws many times, but not unjuſt; As, if he will not ſuſpend a Burthenſom Law, or Revive an Antiquated one, when the publick good requires it, This may render him uncharitable or imprudent, but he is ſafe yet; For though he be bound to proceed according to Law, yet he is not tyed to proceed always according to the beſt Methods, when there are diverſe. But if he ſtop the Courts of Juſtice, erect new ones, or proceed contrary to Law, he Acts without Authority and againſt his own Authority, and puts on a kind of a Vizard, that his Subjects can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know him nor their Duty; for it is the Laws that direct them to the perſon of the King, and their own Duty, without which they could know neither: And if the End be not the publick good it is downright Injuſtice, as well as politically powerleſs.

As in caſe of an Invaſion to burn a garriſon rather than it ſhould be a refuge for the Enemy, or to open Sluces and to drown a part of the Country, for though theſe things have not the form of the Law, they have the reaſon, and that is Publick good: And therefore it is not Law but Neceſſity, not the King's Command but Publick good, that warrants theſe Acts. And when Peace returns, the Injured are to have ſatisfaction made by the Publick, not as of Charity, but as of Juſtice, which ſhows that the Law looks upon it as a Treſpaſs, juſtified only by Neceſſity and the Publick good. And the particular Perſons here, have reaſon to be quiet and make no reſiſtance, becauſe they ſhall reap double benefit by it, one in the Publick good, and another from the Publick Treaſure.

Therefore if the Frame be to reſtrain Arbitrary Power, the Subject cannot owe Arbitraty Allegiance. Allegiance is more in ſome Places and leſs in others; but no Man can owe ſo much Duty to his Prince, as not to have a <hi>Salvo</hi> for God and his Life; and here we can owe none that is againſt our Laws and the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good, for that would deſtroy the Government. Our Allegiance therefore muſt be bounded by our Laws, and not by the King's Word, or Will: No Man can ſwear to obey the King's Word or Will ſimply, but according to Law. It would be Sin to tye our ſelves to think, or ſpeak, or do, what he would have us at large. Our Allegiance therefore muſt be ſuch as will conſiſt with the Frame of our Government, and that muſt be ſuch as is couched in the Body of our Laws. Other Allegiance there can be none, but what is wrapt up in Courteſies and Formalities. For it ſeems the King, as well as the People, is under the Law in ſome Senſe, under the direction of it, though not under the conſtraint; and therefore at his Coronation, he does a kind of Fealty to the Laws and Government, and ſwears Allegiance to them, as to a Supream Lord. The Oath is not only, <hi>Will you grant the Laws, but will you grant and keep the Laws and Cuſtoms of</hi> England; and the Anſwer is, <hi>I grant and promiſe to keep them.</hi> It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain therefore, no Allegiance to the King can be againſt Law, to which he himſelf owes Allegiance.</p>
                  <p>The Caſe being thus far clear, That the Allegiance ſworn to, is no other but our Legal Duty; it does not hinder but that we may reſiſt illegal Force. When the King of the <hi>Scots</hi> ſwore allegiance to our King, it did not deprive him of a juſt defence of his juſt Right, by taking up arms if he were oppreſt. And the King of <hi>England</hi> when he ſwore allegiance to the King of <hi>France,</hi> made no ſcruple to take up arms againſt his Liege Lord, in defence of his juſt Rights: And the Old Lawyers tell us, That the very Villain might in caſe of Rape and Murther arm againſt his Lord; and if the Law arm a Villain againſt his Lord, Subjects are worſe than Villains, if they may not arm againſt their Soveraign Lord's illegal Forces, in defence of their Laws, Lives, Eſtates, and the publick good; but what makes it moſt evident is the Clauſe in King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Charter, which ſays, <hi>If the King invade thoſe Rights, it is Lawful for the Kingdom to riſe againſt him, and do him what injury they can, as though they owed him no Allegiance;</hi> The Words are theſe (if my Author fail me not) <hi>Licet omnibus de Regno noſtro, contra nos inſurgere, &amp; omnia agere quae gravamen noſter reſpiciant, ac ſi nobis in nullo tenerentur.</hi> Much to the ſame purpoſe is in King <hi>John</hi>'s Charter, which I find thus quoted. <hi>Et Illi Barones, cum communa totius terrae, diſtringent &amp; gravabunt Nos.

The regal power is irreſiſtable in all Perſons, from the King to the petty Conſtable; but it does not hinder but that all theſe Perſons may be reſiſted, when they do what they have no political power to. They that have a limited power, and a preſcribed Duty, may either act againſt, or beyond their Commiſſion; and when they ſo do they may be reſiſted: For ſuch acts have no political power in them, though the Perſons have to other purpoſes.

                  <p>Obj. 11. <hi>To this ſome reply, that ſeeing God hath placed the Governing (though limited) Power in the King's Hand, no Man may, by any Natural Right or Private Defence, reſiſt his illegal Force; God s Power muſt not be reſiſted, though abuſed.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a great difference between the abuſe of power, and the want of power; and therefore this argument either ſuppoſes the power greater than it is, or concludes ill. The King and Parliament have indeed an arbitrary power (I do not ſay Infinite, but as Extenſive as the frame of government will bear) and therefore if they make a very grievous Law (though they ought not, for they are under a moral reſtraint though no political) neither the King nor any of his Miniſters may be reſiſted in the due Execution of it. But the King has no power to burden us beyond or againſt Law; and we may thank our own Weakneſs if ever he have Strength to do it. This ſhows us there is a great difference betwixt the abuſe of political power and the want of it. Abuſed power muſt not be reſiſted, but Force without power may. The political power of arbitrary Princes, is more extenſive than their moral power: And this tyes the Subject to Non-reſiſtance, when he is Immorally or Unchriſtianly uſed. They that ſubject themſelves to anothers Diſcretion, deveſt themſelves of all defence. But they that reſerve property and liberty to themſelves, may juſtly defend them, when they are unjuſtly invaded. Had the King an arbitrary power, which he did abuſe to vex the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> I for my part ſhould think my ſelf obliged to ſuffer and not to reſiſt, as I believe did all the Primitive Chriſtians; but ſeeing he has no political power to uſe me as he liſts, and the moſt abſolute Monarch has no moral power to do an unjuſt Act to his Subject: I ſhould be a ſenſeleſs Fool, if without any Obligation either from God or Man, I ſhould ſtand Blows rather than withſtand them. The Truth is, Non-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance ſtretch'd thus far, under this government, would make us like the Two Fools that went to the Field to fight with one Staff, with which <hi>Vice Verſa,</hi> he that had it, cudgell'd the other, who ſtood all the while with his Hands in his pocket Valiantly bearing all the blows his Brother Fool thought good to lay on.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Others conclude otherwiſe againſt this Doctrine, and ſay, The King having the Sacred Power Lodged in him, may not be reſiſted, though he act without, or againſt that power, for reverence of that Juſt power of God that is in him.</p>
                  <p>This looks like a piece of Courtſhip to God, and ſmells more of Superſtition than Divinity: God requires no Honor to the prejudice of Juſtice, or the advancement of Injuſtice; but this too Devout kind of Reverence would inable a bad Prince to injure the Innocent, and would leave Juſtice defenceleſs on Earth. Juſt power is a Sanctuary indeed, but the Sanctuary is of no larger extent than the power. This is evident by the Tenour of all Commiſſions, the granter muſt have a competent power of what he grants, and that warrants the Executor to proceed to the End of the grant; but the hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power to one purpoſe, cannot protect a Man from Reſiſtance, if he proceed to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Chimney man that is irreſiſtable in his Office, is reſiſtable if he gather the Corn in the Town-fields; And the King that receives his Commiſſion from the King of Heaven to execute the Law, and is therefore Irreſiſtable in the execution of it, is yet reſiſtable, if he ſhut up all the Courts of Juſtice, and abuſe his Subjects contrary to Law: In this caſe he acts not by the power of God, but his Own; by an Arm of Fleſh, or the Strength of Wicked men (not by any political power or moral power) but by the Savage power of a Beaſt, or the malicious power of Hell. And how any Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor ſhould accrue to God by a Voluntary ſubmitting to ſuch a power, is beyond my comprehenſion; they are moſt likely to Honor God, that ſtand up moſt for his power, and will ſubmit to no other.</p>
                  <p>I have brought in theſe Two Objections here, becauſe the Declaration is the moſt ſpecious and obvious Plea for Non-reſiſtance, and is uſually back'd with one of theſe Conceits; that either want of political power, is but abuſe of political power; or
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:48501:245"/>that a limited political power is a Sanctuary for unlimited Actions in whomſoever it reſts.</p>

Interpretations of Law therefore ought rather to favour Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Property than Prerogative; becauſe the benefiting of the Subject comes near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the End of the government, than the exceſſive Honouring the Prince. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norary Prerogatives are in their Degree neceſſary, and not ſuperfluous; there muſt be ſomething to maintain the Reverence of Magiſtrates, but they ought to give way to publick Intereſt; and the reſt are nothing but powers placed in the King to do good with, and not good or ill as he pleaſes. A Prerogative therefore cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy a Law, but it may ſupply its Defects, pardoning a Condemn'd Innocent, or a hopeful penitent, or diſpencing with a Law, to one, that by particular Accident, the Law in its Rigour would undo: But no Prerogative can impower the King to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the peoples liberty or property. That diſpencing power, that like a State <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> caſts all the Laws aſleep, and is an Engine of publick Miſchief, is no Prerogative belonging to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> but a Vice that does not belong to it. For it brings guilt upon the King, and damage upon the Subject, and is a real diminution of the Dignities of the Crown: For it, and ſuch like, ſerve only to Impower the King to do Miſchief with ſecurely; that is, they give an Immunity from puniſhment, but not from guilt. As ſuppoſe the King by ſuch a claimed Prerogative, ſhould ſhut up all the Courts of Juſtice, ſo that none ſhould be had; he might be free from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but not from guilt; he is clear by Neceſſity only, not by Right; the Caſe Tranſcends the Frame of the government, none can Judge him that has neither Equals nor Superiors, and ſo he eſcapes; becauſe he cannot be puniſhed, not becauſe he deſerves it not. Thus the pretended Prerogative beſpatters him, and ſo leaves him.</p>

                  <p>The King indeed is Supreme in the Legiſlative part as well as in the Executive part, but he has not the whole Supremacy in the Legiſlative part as he has in the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: He is the Head of that Body in which it reſts, but the Power (like the Soul of Man) is in the whole Body, though moſt eminently in the Head. The Parliament have their Exiſtence, but not their Eſſence from him. When they are called together, they Act by a proper and inherent Right of their own, and not by the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Direction. It may be good Manners to fall upon what he directs them to firſt, but if any thing of greater Moment require diſpatch, they muſt wave a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to do a real kindneſs to the publick Intereſt; which they could not do, were they his Commiſſioners, and received their power to act by from him: It is unnatural for the Stream to ſtop the Fountain head. But ſeeing they act by their own inherent Power, when met, they can reſtrain in the King that he cannot make a Law without them, or give ſuch an interpretation of any, either by himſelf or his Judges, as ſhall bind the Subjects to follow, or is not Reverſible in Parliament; for ſuch Interpretation is
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:48501:246"/>part of the Legiſlative power, and that reſts in the King and Subjects Conjunctim. Had the King Authority to bind his Interpretations for Law upon the Subject, he might at Pleaſure elude any Law, and Law would be but a Sconce for Arbitrary power. The Opinion indeed of the Judges is reverend, but not irreverſible. None can finally bind an Interpretation on the Subject but thoſe that can make Law: Therefore if the King and Parliament differ about the ſenſe of a Law, it is not legally decided till both agree in one ſenſe. But that ſenſe that is really for the publick good has the Right of a Law, though not the Form, and they that juſtifie ſuch an Interpretation, are juſtifiable by the Law of Nature; for though it tranſcend the proceſs of Courts, and cannot have the force of a political Law, yet Reaſon (Mankinds prime Law) juſtifies Men to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a publick good before a private Intereſt; and what is for the publick good, they that feel are beſt able to Judge.</p>

Obedience is due as far as the Law requires, and ſomething farther; a particular perſon muſt ſuffer rather than the Honour and Majeſty of the Prince ſhould be brought into Contempt; for though the Law does not bind to this, yet Conſcience and Reaſon do, the publick Intereſt muſt be promoted; Scandal prevented, and the Government ſecured from Contempt, though it prejudice ſome particular perſon; for ſuch Contempt may ariſe from a juſt refuſal of Obedience in ſome ſmall and ſingle Inſtances, and may be of worſe conſequence to the publick than a private Injury, but if the thing commanded tend to deſtroy the Government, or introduce a general Calamity, Diſobedience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Duty, and ſuch commands (in this government) are morally, politically, and divinely powerleſs; and the Diſobedient, in ſuch a Caſe, does the King as good Service, as he that diſcovers Treaſon; for he gives him Notice that his Foot is enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a Snare, and that his preſervation ſtands in deſiſting, and repenting if he would but heed it: And if the Diſobedience be once good, the higher it goes the better it is continuing ſtill good; it is abſurd to go from good to worſe extenſively. Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that is good, is ſtill better as it is more likely to prevent the Evil: And then Diſobedience defenſive, is doubtleſs better than paſſive; for that would introduce the Evil Voluntarily, that is, they that were not willing to do it themſelves, were yet willing to let others do it; and how far that can clear them I ſee not. For though it is not a downright conſenting to ſubvert the Government, yet it is a conſenting that it ſhall be done, rather than they will run the hazard to defend it, or prevent it; which is but <hi>Pilate</hi>-like, to waſh the Hands of what their Hearts tell them they are Acceſſary to.</p>

He that has taken Poyſon muſt ſuffer the Violence of a Vomit; and they that are Sick muſt be made Sicker oft before they can be made Well. The prejudice therefore the Government receives, by thoſe that go about to reſtore it, does no more denominate them Enemies to the State than the little griping of Phyſick can denominate Phyſicians Enemies to Nature. The Evil proceeds from the Diſeaſe, not the Remedy, and the Guilt is upon them that gave the Wound not thoſe that dreſt it; all the Anguiſh and Smart that follows the Skilful Chirurgeons Hand, is not to be attributed to the Chirurgeon, but to the wicked Aſſaſſine; and therefore though this Reſtoration have the Evil of a Civil War, yet the Guilt of all that Evil lies upon the Cauſers. Men are not bound to loſe their Right for fear of harming Wicked Men, nor to ſave a leſs Good, by loſing a greater; a ſhort Evil is to be choſen rather than a perpetual one: Men had better drudge to preſerve their own Freedom, than to enter into Bondage to drudge for others; and the Patriots of our Country do well to bear the Burthen of a War, rather than to become Slaves themſelves, and leave Popery, Beggary, and Slavery to their Poſterity.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Neither this, nor any other Government that I know of, affords abſolute means of Peace and Preſervation: The Government is effectual enough ſo far as it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but it is not extenſive enough. If the Monarch were Arbitrary, then no Cauſe could introduce Reſiſtance; the Nation might be at Peace, but the Subjects could not be ſafe, and Liberty and Property would be loſt: Therefore if Safety, Liberty and Property be worth the preſerving, they muſt be defended when wicked Men would wreſt them from us. The Conſtitution of this Government is ſuch, That if the King and Parliament, or the King and the Subjects differ about Fundamental Rights, they have no way to reconcile the Difference but by their own Conſent. If the King without the Parliament could determine the Difference, he would be Arbitrary; and if the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or the Parliament, could determine it without him, they would be Supream, and then it could be no Monarchy; and if the Judges had the determining Power, they would get the Supremacy from both; and if a Foreigner were to decide the Matter, he would ſeek his own Advantage; ſo that they muſt either condeſcend for Peace ſake to one anothers Propoſals, ſo as not to deſtroy the Government, or they muſt ſuffer the Grievance, and let the Quarrel fall for a time, till the injurious can be worn to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, or they muſt fight it out; for that is their going to Law, the Souldiers are their Jury-men, and Victory is their Verdict. For the Queſtion is not about breach of Government, but whether that be the Government, or no; and ſeeing this Cauſe tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends the executive Part of the Government, it cannot be decided by Legal Progreſs, but by Law-makers; and if they cannot agree, Men are at liberty to join with that ſide they judg in the right: Reaſon and Conſcience muſt be their Guide, the Law can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, and they that proceed on this ground are their own Warrants on either ſide, for neither have a Legal Power to determine the other: Therefore the Power of Judging is neither Authoritative nor Civil, and ſo argues no Superiority in thoſe that judg, but only a Power reſiding in reaſonable Creatures, or judging of their own Act, of which they never were deveſted by any lawful Authority, and therefore may lawfully uſe upon ſuch Occaſions; and though the Government does not Warrant a Civil War, in ſuch a caſe, yet the End and Reaſon of this Government does. For it being fram'd to prevent the exorbitant Power of the Prince, for the publick Good; he that fights for the publick Good, againſt an Uſurped Power, or an Arbitrary Invader of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Rights, is juſtified by the deſign and intendment of the Frame, and conſequently by the Equity of the Government, though not by any preſcribed Form. For ſeeing many things are morally honeſt and profitable, that are not reduced into poſitive Laws, Men cannot proceed to thoſe things (if at any time they become neceſſary) by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing Forms of Law, becauſe they have none; and ſo, in this caſe, the Queſtion being not about Breach of Law, but what is Law. And the Law not able to ſatisfy both King and People, each claiming contrary Rights from the ſame Laws, the Deciſion of this Caſe, though it be very good and profitable for this Nation, yet has no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:48501:247"/>form of Law to direct us to; and therefore both King and People are to proceed according to moral Honeſty, to the end of the Government, that is, the publick Good.</p>
                  <p>The Concluſion of all which, is, That ſeeing reſiſting of Illegal and Arbitrary Forces, in defence of the Laws and Publick Intereſt of the Land, is not againſt the Scriptures, and conſequently no Sin; nor againſt moral Honeſty, and conſequently no Crime (not againſt Law but Law-breakers, not againſt true Allegiance, or any Prerogative of the Crown, no Rebellion, no Uſurpation of the Sword, nor Criminal Diſobedience, and not incommodious or unſafe for the Publick, in reſpect of the impendant Injuries and Hazards it removes) nor inconſiſtent with the Frame of Government, which cannot otherwiſe decide an obſtinate Difference betwixt King and People. I cannot but conclude it is a very worthy and virtuous Act to be in Arms for defence of the Laws, the King's juſt Rights, and the Publick Good; and conſequently that thoſe Gentlemen, who are in Arms for defence of our Laws, Liberties, and Lives, againſt Illegal Forces, Arbitrary Commands, and Uſurped Powers, are in a virtuous Poſt. For if the Subjects Right might not be defended by this means, it would be all loſt; it being all one, in theſe days, to have no Right, and to have no ſufficient means to defend it. The Doctrine of Non-reſiſtance plainly puts all we have into an ill King's hands, and the good Ones will ſcarce part with what they are apt to love ſo dearly, and we parted with ſo freely; ſhould we therefore preach this Doctrine to our Princes, and tell them that they might take what we have without danger or oppoſition, we ſhould teach them to try our Patience: if all muſt be referr'd to their Conſciences, they will ſoon (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of a Jeſuit) find caſe enough and cauſe enough to ſecure that, and leave the examination of them to the latter Day; hatred of our Perſons, love of our Eſtates, diſguſt at our Words or Actions, or diſlike of our Religion, will ſoon judg us unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of our Liberty and Property, as well as it has already done of our Offices, Honours, and Preferments: Paſſion and Scorn, Pride and Ambition, Covetouſneſs and Prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, would all prey upon what we had, with a quiet (though not with a good) Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; but eſpecially if the King were poor and neceſſitous, either by wilful Profuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Negligence: for Nature would even tell him in ſuch a Caſe, That we had all better want than he, and then farewel Property; the worſt you could do him, was but to pet and cry a bit, and perhaps that might become a Pleaſure to him too; and then you had nothing to reſt on, but that God would give you the Kingdom of Heaven, for beggering your ſelves, impoveriſhing the Church, and giving what you had to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's Service; an ill Ground for ſuch coſtly Hopes to ſtand upon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Doctrine renders Government prejudicial to the greateſt part of Mankind, depriving them of all juſt Defence: For the illegal Force bars them of legal Defence; and the Doctrine of Non-reſiſtance bars them of Corporal, and ſo Man (under one of the beſt Governments in the World) is left naked in the midſt of Savage Beaſts, (for <hi>homo lupus</hi>) and muſt not, though he be able, make any defence for himſelf. Thus all the Rights of Society and Nature, are ſacrificed to the Luſt and Age of a wicked King, and his evil Inſtruments; and the Body Politick is really in a worſe Condition than an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Multitude, for they may defend themſelves (if they will) againſt any Enemy; but theſe have an Enemy, and may not defend themſelves, though in never ſo juſt a Cauſe; and what is worſt of all, muſt hold their own Hands whilſt others cut their Throats.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> This Doctrine would make all Monarchs Arbitrary Monarchs, and a like in effect; for if the Subjects may not (nor ought if they were able) reſiſt the Prince any further than by refuſing to join with him, then he were Arbitrary, and might do what he pleas'd without oppoſition, he had but a Moral Reſtraint, and the moſt abſolute Monarch had that upon him; and all Limitations in the Fundamentals of Government would be idle and ſuperfluous, becauſe they contained only ſuch Rights as others might take from us at pleaſure, and we might not defend or oppoſe. But the end of limitted Monarchies is, not that the Monarch might not lawfully or rightfully oppreſs; for an Arbitrary Monarch is bound to all that: but the end of all Limitations in Government, is, That the Prince may want Means as well as Right to oppreſs, that he may not be able to injure the Subject at all, either lawfully or unlawfully; they are limitted to govern by Laws, that they may want Means as well as Right to include the Subjects Property. But the Doctrine of Non-reſiſtance give them Means for a Temptation, and is indeed but a fair Bait to draw them into a Snare.</p>

Now this Duty of Self-preſervation, is exerted in Inſtances of two ſorts; the one are, in the reſiſting of violent Aggreſſors; the other are the taking of juſt Revenges of thoſe, who have invaded us ſo ſecretly, that we could not prevent them, and ſo violently, that we could not reſiſt them: In which Caſes the Principle of Self-preſervation warrants us, both to recover what is our own, with juſt Damages, and alſo to put ſuch unjuſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons out of a capacity of doing the like Injuries any more, either to our ſelves, or to any others. Now in theſe Inſtances of Self-preſervation, this difference is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; that the firſt cannot be limited by any ſlow Forms, ſince a preſſing Danger requires a vigorous Repulſe, and cannot admit of Delays; whereas the ſecond, of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Revenges, or Reparations, is not of ſuch haſte, but that it may be brought under Rules and Forms.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The true and Original Notion of <hi>Civil Society</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> is, that it is a Compromiſe made by ſuch a Body of Men, by which they reſign up the right of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Reparations, either in the way of Juſtice againſt one another, or in the way of War againſt their Neighbours, to ſuch a ſingle Perſon, or to ſuch a Body of Men as they think fit to truſt with this. And in the management of this <hi>Civil Society,</hi> great diſtinction is to be made, between the Power of making Laws for the Regulating the Conduct of it, and the Power of Executing thoſe Laws: The <hi>Supream Authority</hi> muſt ſtill be ſuppoſed to be lodged with thoſe who have the Legiſlative Power reſerved to them; but not with thoſe who have only the Executive; which is plainly a <hi>Truſt,</hi> when it is ſeparated from the Legiſlative Power; and all Truſts, by their Nature import, that thoſe to whom they are given, are accountable, even though it ſhould not be expreſly ſpecified in the words of the <hi>Truſt</hi> it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. It cannot be ſuppoſed by the Principles of Natural Religion, that God has au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized any one Form of Government, any other way than as the general Rules of Order, and of Juſtice, oblige all Men not to ſubvert Conſtitutions, nor diſturb the Peace of Mankind, or invade thoſe Rights with which the Law may have veſted ſome Perſons; for it is certain, that as private Contracts lodg or tranſlate private Rights, ſo the publick Laws can likewiſe lodg ſuch Rights, Prerogatives, and Revenues, in thoſe, under whoſe Protection they put themſelves, and in ſuch a manner, that they may come to have as good a Title to theſe, as any private Perſon can have to his Property: ſo that it becomes an Act of high Injuſtice and Violence, to invade theſe; which is ſo far a greater Sin than any ſuch Actions would be againſt a private Perſon, as the publick Peace and Order is preferrable to all private Conſiderations whatſoever. So that in truth, the Principles of natural Religion, give thoſe that are in Authority no Power at all, but they do only ſecure them in the poſſeſſion of that which is theirs by Law. And as no Conſiderations of Religion can bind me to pay another more than I indeed owe him, but do only bind me more ſtrictly to pay what I owe; ſo the Conſiderations of Religion do indeed bring Subjects under ſtricter Obligations to pay all due Allegiance and Submiſſion to their Princes, but they do not at all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that Allegiance further than the Law carries it. And though a Man has no
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:48501:248"/>divine Right to his Property, but has acquired it by human Means, ſuch as Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, or Induſtry, yet he has a ſecurity for the Enjoyment of it from a Divine Right; ſo though Princes have no immediate Warrants from Heaven, either for their original Titles, or for the extent of them, yet they are ſecured in the poſſeſſion of them by the Principles and Rules of Natural Religion.</p>
            <p n="5">V. It is to be conſidered, that as a private Perſon can bind himſelf to another Man's Service, by different Degrees, either as an ordinary Servant for Wages, or as one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate for a longer time, as an Apprentice; or by a total giving himſelf up to another, as in the caſe of Slavery: In all which Caſes the general Name of <hi>Maſter</hi> may be equally uſed; yet the Degrees of his Power are to be judged by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Contract: ſo likewiſe Bodies of Men can give themſelves up in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Degrees, to the Conduct of others: and therefore, though all thoſe may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the ſame name of <hi>King,</hi> yet every ones Power is to be taken from the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of that Authority which is lodged in him, and not from any general Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations founded on ſome equivocal Terms, ſuch as <hi>King, Sovereign,</hi> or <hi>Supream.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. It is certain, that God, as the Creator and Governour of the World, may ſet up whom he will, to rule over other Men: But this Declaration of his Will, muſt be made evident by Prophets, or other extraordinary Men ſent of him, who have ſome manifeſt Proofs of the Divine Authority that is committed to them on ſuch Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and upon ſuch Perſons declaring the Will of God, in favour of any others, that Declaration is to be ſubmitted to, and obeyed. But this pretence of a Divine Delegation, can be carried no further than to thoſe who are thus expreſly marked out, and is unjuſtly claimed by thoſe who can prove no ſuch Declaration to have been ever made in favour of them, or their Families. Nor does it appear reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conclude from their being in poſſeſſion, that it is the Will of God that it ſhould be ſo, this juſtifies all Uſurpers when they are ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. The Meaſures of Power, and by conſequence of Obedience, muſt be taken from the expreſs Laws of any State, or Body of Men, from the Oaths that they ſwear, or from immemorial Preſcription, and a long Poſſeſſion, which both give a Title, and in a long tract of Time make a bad one become good, ſince Preſcription when it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Memory of Man, and is not diſputed by any other Pretender, gives by the common ſenſe of all Men a juſt and good Title: So upon the whole matter, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of all Civil Authority, are to be taken either from expreſs Laws, immemorial Cuſtoms, or from particular Oaths, which the Subjects ſwear to their Princes: this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill to be laid down for a Principle, that in all the Diſputes between <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Liberty, Power</hi> muſt always be proved, but <hi>Liberty</hi> proves it ſelf; the one being founded only upon poſitive Law, and the other upon the Law of Nature.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. If from the general Principles of human Society, and natural Religion, we carry this matter to be examined by the Scriptures; it is clear that all the Paſſages that are in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> are not to be made uſe of in this matter, of neither ſide. For as the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was given to the Jews by an immediate Grant from Heaven, ſo God reſerved ſtill this to himſelf, and to the Declarations that he ſhould make from time to time, either by his Prophets, or by the Anſwers that came from the Cloud of Glory that was between the Cherubims, to ſet up Judges or Kings over them, and to pull them down again as he thought fit. Here was an expreſs Delegation made by God, and therefore all that was done in that Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, either for or againſt Princes, is not to be made uſe of in any other State, that is founded on another Bottom and Conſtitution, and all the Expreſſions in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> relating to Kings, ſince they belong to Perſons that were immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by God, are without any ſort of Reaſon applied to thoſe, who can pretend to no ſuch deſignation, neither for themſelves nor for their Anceſtors.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. As for the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> it is plain, that there are no Rules given in it, neither for the Forms of Government in general, nor for the Degrees of any one Form in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; but the general Rules of Juſtice, Order and Peace, being eſtabliſhed in it upon higher Motives, and more binding Conſiderations, than ever they were in any other Religion whatſoever, we are moſt ſtrictly bound by it, to obſerve the Conſtitution in which we are; and it is plain, that the Rules ſet us in the Goſpel, can be carried no further. It is indeed clear from the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> that the Chriſtian Religion, as ſuch, gives us no grounds to defend or propagate it by force. It is a Doctrine of the Croſs, and of Faith, and Patience under it: And if by the Order of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and of any Conſtitution of Government, under which we are born, we are brought under Sufferings for our profeſſing of it, we may indeed retire and fly out of any ſuch Country, if we can; but if that is denied us, we muſt then according to this Religion, ſubmit to thoſe Sufferings under which we may be brought, conſidering
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:48501:248"/>that God will be glorified by us in ſo doing, and that he will both ſupport us under our Sufferings, and gloriouſly reward us for them.</p>
            <p>This was the ſtate of the Chriſtian Religion, during the three firſt Centuries, under Heathen Emperors, and a Conſtitution in which <hi>Paganiſm</hi> was eſtabliſhed by Law. But if by the Laws of any Government, the Chriſtian Religion, or any Form of it, is become a part of the Subjects Property, it then falls under another Conſideration, not as it is a <hi>Religion,</hi> but as it is become one of the principal Rights of the Subjects, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and profeſs it: and then we muſt judg of the Invaſions made on that, as we do of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Invaſion that is made on our other Rights.</p>
            <p n="10">X. All the Paſſages in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> that relate to Civil Government, are to be expounded as they were truly meant, in oppoſition to that falſe Notion of the Jews, who believed themſelves to be ſo immediately under the Divine Authority, that they could not become the Subjects of any other Power; particularly of one that was not of their Nation, or of their Religion; therefore they thought they could not be under the Roman Yoke, nor bound to pay Tribute to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> but judged that they were only ſubject out of fear, by reaſon of the force that lay on them, but not for Conſcience ſake: and ſo in all their diſperſion, both at <hi>Rome</hi> and elſewhere, they thought they were God's Freemen, and made uſe of this pretended Liberty as a cloak of Maliciouſneſs. In oppoſition to all which, ſince in a courſe of many Years they had asked the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Roman Yoke, and were come under their Authority, our Saviour ordered them to continue in that, by his ſaying, <hi>Render to</hi> Ceſar <hi>that which is</hi> Ceſar<hi>'s;</hi> and both St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his General <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> have very poſitively condemned that pernicious Maxim; but without any formal Declarations made of the Rules or Meaſures of Government. And ſince both the People and Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> had acknowledged the Power that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had indeed violently uſurped, it became Legal when it was thus ſubmitted to, and confirmed both by the Senate and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and it was eſtabliſhed in his Family by a long Preſcription, when thoſe <hi>Epiſtles</hi> were writ: ſo that upon the whole matter, all that is in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> upon this Subject, imports no more, but that all Chriſtians are bound to acquieſce in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and ſubmit to it, according to the Conſtitution that is ſettled by Law.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. We are then at laſt brought to the Conſtitution of our <hi>Engliſh Government;</hi> ſo that no general Conſiderations from Speculations about Sovereign Power, nor from any Paſſages either of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> ought to determin us in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which muſt be fixed from the Laws and Regulations that have been made among us. It is then certain, that with relation to the executive Part of the Government, the Law has lodged that ſingly in the King; ſo that the whole Adminiſtration of it is in him: but the Legiſlative Power is lodged between the King and the Two Houſes of Parliament; ſo that the Power of making and repealing Laws, is not ſingly in the King, but only ſo far as the Two Houſes concur with him. It is alſo clear, that the King has ſuch a determined extent of Prerogative, beyond which he has no Authority: as for inſtance, if he levies Money of his People, without a Law impowring him to it, he goes beyond the Limits of his Power, and asks that to which he has no right: ſo that there lies no obligation on the Subject to grant it; and if any in his Name uſe Violence for the obtaining it, they are to be looked on as ſo many Robbers, that invade our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and they being violent Aggreſſours, the Principle of Self-preſervation ſeems here to take place, and to warrant as violent a Reſiſtance.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. There is nothing more evident, than that <hi>England</hi> is a free Nation, that has its Liberties and Properties reſerved to it by many poſitive and expreſs Laws: if then we have a right to our Property, we muſt likewiſe be ſuppoſed to have a right to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it: for thoſe Rights are by the Law ſecured againſt the Invaſions of the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and by conſequence we muſt have a right to preſerve them againſt thoſe Invaſions. It is alſo evidently declared by our Law, that all Orders and Warrants that are iſſued out in oppoſition to them, are null of themſelves; and by conſequence, any that pretend to have Commiſſions from the King, for thoſe ends, are to be conſiderd as if they had none at all: ſince thoſe Commiſſions being void of themſelves, are indeed no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions in the Conſtruction of the Law; and therefore thoſe who act in vertue of them, are ſtill to be conſidered as private Perſons who come to invade and diſturb us. It is alſo to be obſerved, that there are ſome Points that are juſtly diſputable and doubtful, and others that are ſo manifeſt, that it is plain that any Objections that can be made to them, are rather forced Pretences, than ſo much as plauſible Colours. It is true, if the Caſe is doubtful, the Intereſt of the publick Peace and Order, ought to carry it; but the Caſe is quite different when the Invaſions that are made upon Liberty and Property, are plain and viſible to all that conſider them.</p>
            <pb n="486" facs="tcp:48501:249"/>
            <p n="13">XIII. The main and great Difficulty here, is, that though our Government does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed aſſert the <hi>Liberty of the Subject,</hi> yet there are many expreſs Laws made, that lodg the Militia ſingly in the King, that make it plainly unlawful upon any pretence whatſoever, to take Arms againſt the King, or any commiſſioned by him: And theſe Laws have been put in the form of an Oath, which all that have born any Employment ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Church or State have ſworn and therefore thoſe Laws, for the aſſuring our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, do indeed bind the King's Conſcience, and may affect his Miniſters: yet ſince it is a Maxim of our Law, that the King can do no wrong, theſe cannot be carried ſo far as to juſtify our taking Arms againſt him, be the Tranſgreſſions of Law ever ſo many and ſo manifeſt. And ſince this has been the conſtant Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> it will be a very heavy Imputation on us, if it appears, that though we held thoſe Opinions as long as the Court and the Crown have favoured us, yet as ſoon as the Court turns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, we change our Principles.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. Here is a true Difficulty of this whole Matter, and therefore it ought to be exactly conſidered: 1. All general Words, how large ſoever, are ſtill ſuppoſed to have a tacit exception, and reſerve in them, if the Matter ſeems to require it. Children are commanded to obey their Parents in all things: Wives are declared by the Scripture to be ſubject to their Husbands in all things, <hi>as the Church is unto Chriſt:</hi> And yet how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive ſoever theſe Words may ſeem to be, there is ſtill a reſerve to be underſtood in them; and though by our Form of Marriage, the Parties ſwear to one another <hi>till Death them do part,</hi> yet few doubt but that this Bond is diſſolved by Adultery, though it is not named; for odious things ought not to be ſuſpected, and therefore not named up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch Occaſions: But when they fall out, they carry ſtill their own force with them. 2. When there ſeem to be a Contradiction between two Articles in the Conſtitution, we ought to examin which of the two is the moſt evident, and the moſt important, and ſo we ought to fix upon it, and then we muſt give ſuch an accommodating ſenſe to that which ſeems to contradict it, that ſo we may reconcile thoſe together. Here then are two ſeeming Contradictions in our Conſtitution: The one is the <hi>Publick Liberty</hi> of the Nation; the other is the renouncing of all <hi>Reſiſtance,</hi> in caſe that were invaded. It is plain, that our <hi>Liberty</hi> is only a thing that we enjoy at the King's Diſcretion, and during his Pleaſure, if the other againſt all Reſiſtance is to be underſtood according to the utmoſt extent of the Words. Therefore ſince the chief Deſign of our whole Law, and of all the ſeveral Rules of our Conſtitution, is to ſecure and maintain our Liberty, we ought to lay that down for a Concluſion, that it is both the moſt plain and the moſt important of the two: And therefore the other Article againſt <hi>Reſiſtance,</hi> ought to be ſo ſoftned, as that it do not deſtroy this. 3. Since it is by a Law that Reſiſtance is condemned, we ought to underſtand it in ſuch a ſenſe, as that it does not deſtroy all other Laws: And therefore the intent of this Law, muſt only relate to the Executive Power, which is in the King, and not to the Legiſlative, in which we cannot ſuppoſe that our Legiſlators, who made that Law, intended to give up that, which we plainly ſee they reſolved ſtill to preſerve entire, according to the Antient Conſtitution. So then, the not reſiſting the King, can only be applied to the Executive Power, that ſo upon no pretence of ill Adminiſtrations in the Execution of the Law, it ſhould be lawful to reſiſt him; but this cannot with any reaſon be extended to an Invaſion of the <hi>Legiſlative Power,</hi> or to a total <hi>Subverſion of the Government.</hi> For it being plain, that the Law did not deſign to lodg that Power in the King; it is alſo plain, that it did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſecure him in it, in caſe he ſhould ſet about it. 4. The Law mentioning the <hi>King,</hi> or thoſe Commiſſionated by him, ſhews plainly, that it only deſigned to ſecure the King in the Executive Power; for the word <hi>Commiſſion</hi> neceſſarily imports this, ſince if it is not according to Law, it is no Commiſſion; and by conſequence, thoſe who act in virtue of it, are not commiſſionated by the King in the Senſe of the Law. The King likewiſe imports a Prince clothed by Law with the Regal Prerogative; but if he goes to ſubvert the whole Foundation of the Government, he ſubverts that by which he himſelf has his Power, and by conſequence he annuls his own Power; and then he ceaſes to be King, having endeavoured to deſtroy that upon which his own Authority is founded.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. It is acknowledged by the greateſt Aſſertors of Monarchial Power, that in ſome Caſes a King may fall from his Power, and in other Caſes that he may fall from the Exerciſe of it. His deſerting his People, his going about to enſlave, or ſell them to any other, or a furious going about to deſtroy them, are in the opinion of the moſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical Lawyers, ſuch Abuſes, that they naturally diveſt thoſe that are guilty of them; of their whole Authority. <hi>Infancy</hi> or <hi>Phrenzy,</hi> do alſo put them under the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianſhip of others. All the crowned Heads of <hi>Europe</hi> have, at leaſt ſecretly, approved of the putting the late King of <hi>Portugal</hi> under a Guardianſhip, and the keeping him ſtill
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:48501:249"/>Priſoner for a few Acts of Rage, that had been fatal to a very few perſons: And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven our <hi>Court</hi> gave the firſt countenance to it, though of all others the <hi>late King</hi> had the moſt reaſon to have done it at leaſt laſt of all; ſince it juſtified a younger Brother's ſupplanting the Elder; yet the evidence of the thing carried it even againſt Intereſt. Therefore if a King goes about to ſubvert the Government, and to overturn the whole Conſtitution, he by this muſt be ſuppoſed either to fall from his Power, or at leaſt from the Exerciſe of it, ſo far as that he ought to be put under Guardians; and according to the Caſe of <hi>Portugal,</hi> the next <hi>Heir</hi> falls naturally to be the Guardian.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. The next thing to be conſidered, is to ſee in Fact whether the Foundations of this Government have been ſtruck at, and whether thoſe Errors, that have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps committed, are only ſuch Malverſations, as ought to be imputed only to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Frailty, and to the Ignorance, Inadvertencies, or Paſſions to which all Princes may be ſubject, as well as other Men. But this will beſt appear if we conſider what are the Fundamental Points of our <hi>Government,</hi> and the chief Securities that we have for our <hi>Liberties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Authority of the <hi>Law</hi> is indeed all in one word, ſo that if the <hi>King</hi> pretends to a Power to <hi>diſpence</hi> with <hi>Laws,</hi> there is nothing left, upon which the <hi>Subject</hi> can depend; and yet as if <hi>Diſpenſing Power</hi> were not enough, if Laws are wholly ſuſpended for all time coming, this is plainly a repealing of them, when likewiſe the Men in whoſe hands the Adminiſtration of Juſtice is put by Law, ſuch as <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> are allowed to tread all Laws under foot, even thoſe that infer an Incapacity on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves if they violate them; this is ſuch a breaking of the whole Conſtitution, that we can no more have the Adminiſtration of Juſtice, ſo that it is really a Diſſolution of the <hi>Government;</hi> ſince all Trials, Sentences, and the Executions of them, are become ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unlawful Acts, that are null and void of themſelves.</p>
            <p>The next thing in our <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> which ſecures to us our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> is a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>Lawful Parliament.</hi> Now not to mention the breach of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennial Parliaments,</hi> it being above three years ſince we had a Seſſion that enacted any Law, Methods have been taken, and are daily a taking, that render this impoſſible. <hi>Parliaments</hi> ought to be choſen with an entire Liberty, and without either Force or Preingagements: whereas if all Men are required beforehand to enter into Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments how they will vote if they are choſen themſelves, or how they will give their Voices in the Electing of others? This is plainly ſuch a preparation to a Parliament, as would indeed make it no <hi>Parliament,</hi> but a <hi>Cabal,</hi> if one were choſen, after all that Corruption of Perſons, who had preingaged themſelves; and after the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Turning out of all Perſons out of Imployments who had refuſed to do it; and if there are ſuch daily Regulations made in the Towns, that it is plain thoſe who manage them intend at laſt to put ſuch a number of Men in the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as will certainly chuſe the Perſons who are recommended to them. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, if there are ſuch a number of Sheriffs and Mayors made over <hi>England,</hi> by whom the Elections muſt be conducted and returned, who are now under an Incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city by Law, and ſo are no Legal Officers, and by conſequence thoſe Elections that paſs under their Authority are null and void; if, I ſay, it is clear that things are brought to this, then the Government is diſſolved, becauſe it is impoſſible to have a <hi>Free and Legal Parliament</hi> in this ſtate of things. If then both the Authority of the Law, and the Conſtitution of the Parliament are ſtruck at and diſſolved, here is a plain Subverſion of the whole Government. But if we enter next into the particular Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Government, we will find the like Diſorder among them all.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Church of England,</hi> make a great Article of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the latter being ſecured not only of old by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> but by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpecial <hi>Laws</hi> made of late; and there are particular Laws made in K. <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and the late King's time, ſecuring them from all <hi>Commiſſions</hi> that the King can raiſe for Judging or Cenſuring them: if then in oppoſition to this, a <hi>Court</hi> ſo condemned is erected, which proceeds to judg and cenſure the Clergy, and even to diſſeiſe them of their Freeholds, without ſo much as the form of a Trial, though this is the moſt indiſpenſable Law of all thoſe that ſecures the Property of <hi>England;</hi> and if the King pretends that he can require the Clergy to publiſh all his Arbitrary Declarations, and in particular, one that ſtrikes at their whole Settlement, and has ordered Proceſs to be begun againſt all that diſobey'd this illegal Warrant, and has treated ſo great a number of the Biſhops as Criminals, only for repreſenting to him the Reaſons of their not obeying him; if likewiſe the King is not ſatisfied to profeſs his own Religion openly, though even that is contrary to Law, but has ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Rome,</hi> and received Nuntio<hi>'s</hi> from thence, which is plainly Treaſon by Law; if likewiſe many <hi>Popiſh Churches</hi> and <hi>Chappels</hi> have been publickly opened;
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:48501:250"/>if ſeveral <hi>Colledges</hi> of <hi>Jeſuits</hi> have been ſet up in divers parts of the Nation, and one of the Order has been made a Privy Counſellor, and a principal Miniſter of <hi>State;</hi> and if Papiſts, and even thoſe who turn to that Religion, though declared Traitors by Law, are brought into all the chief Employments, both Military and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; then it is plain, That all the Rights of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and the whole eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> are ſtruck at, and deſigned to be overturned; ſince all theſe things, as they are notoriouſly illegal, ſo they evidently demonſtrate, That the great deſign of them all, is the rooting out of this <hi>Peſtilent Hereſy,</hi> in their ſtile, I mean the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place, If in the whole Courſe of Juſtice, it is viſible, that there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practiſing upon the Judges, that they are turned out upon their varying from the Intentions of the Court, and if Men of no Reputation nor Abilities are put in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; if an Army is kept up in time of Peace, and Men who withdraw from that illegal Service are hanged up as Criminals, without any colour of Law, which by conſequence are ſo many Murders; and if the Souldiery are connived at, and encouraged in the moſt enormous Crimes, that ſo they may be thereby prepared to commit greater ones, and from ſingle Rapes and Murders, proceed to a rape upon all our Liberties and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Nation: if, I ſay, all theſe things are true in fact, then it is plain, that there is ſuch a diſſolution of the Government made, that there is not any one part of it left found and entire; and if all theſe things are done now, it is eaſy to imagine what may be expected, when <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> that ſpares no Man, and <hi>Popery</hi> that ſpares no Heretick, are finally eſtabliſhed: Then we may look for nothing but Gabelles, Tailles, Impoſitions, Benevolences, and all ſorts of illegal Taxes, as from the other we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Burnings, Maſſacres, and Inquiſitions. In what is doing in <hi>Scotland,</hi> we may gather what is to be expected in <hi>England;</hi> where if the King has over and over again declared, that he is veſted with an <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> to which all are bound to <hi>obey without reſerve,</hi> and has upon that annulled almoſt all the Acts of Parliament that paſſed in K. <hi>James</hi> the Iſt's Minority, though they were ratified by himſelf when he came to be of age, and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by all the ſubſequent Kings, not excepting the preſent. We muſt then conclude from thence, what is reſolved on here in <hi>England,</hi> and what will be put in execution as ſoon as it is thought that the Times can bear it. When likewiſe the whole Settlement of <hi>Ireland</hi> is ſhaken, and the Army that was raiſed, and is maintained by Taxes, that were given for an Army of <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants,</hi> to ſecure them from a new Maſſacre by the <hi>Iriſh Papiſts,</hi> is now all filled with <hi>Iriſh Papiſts,</hi> as well as almoſt all the other Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; it is plain, That not only all the <hi>Britiſh Proteſtants</hi> inhabiting that Iſland, are in daily danger of being butchered a ſecond time, but that the Crown of <hi>England</hi> is in danger of loſing that Iſland, it being now put wholly into the hands and power of the Native <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who, as they formerly offered themſelves up ſometimes to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſometimes to the Pope, and once to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> ſo are they perhaps at this preſent treating with another Court for the ſale and ſurrender of the Iſland, and for the Maſſacre of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>If thus all the ſeveral Branches of our Conſtitution are diſſolved, it might be at leaſt expected, that one part ſhould be left entire, and that is the <hi>Regal Dignity,</hi> and yet even that is proſtituted, when we ſee a young <hi>Child</hi> put in the reverſion of it, and pretended to be the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales;</hi> concerning whoſe being born of the <hi>Queen,</hi> there appear to be not only no certain Proofs, but there are all the Preſumptions that can poſſibly be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the contrary. No Proofs were ever given either to the <hi>Princeſs of Denmark,</hi> or to any other <hi>Proteſtant Ladies,</hi> in whom we ought to repoſe any Confidence that the <hi>Queen</hi> was ever with Child; that whole matter being managed with ſo much Myſteriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that there were violent and publick Suſpitions of it before the Birth. But the whole Contrivance of the Birth, the ſending away the <hi>Princeſs of</hi> Denmark, the ſudden ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Reckoning,</hi> the <hi>Queen</hi>'s ſudden going to St. <hi>James</hi>'s, her no leſs ſudden pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Delivery;</hi> the hurrying the <hi>Child</hi> into another Room without ſhewing it to thoſe preſent, and without their hearing it cry; and the myſterious Conduct of all ſince that time; no ſatisfaction being given to the <hi>Princeſs of Denmark</hi> upon her Return from the <hi>Bath,</hi> nor to any other <hi>Proteſtant Ladies,</hi> of the <hi>Queen</hi>'s having been really brought to bed. Theſe are all ſuch evident Indications of a baſe Impoſture, in this matter, that as the <hi>Nation</hi> has the juſteſt reaſon in the World to doubt of it, ſo they have all poſſible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be at no quiet till they ſee a <hi>Legal</hi> and <hi>Free Parliament</hi> aſſembled, which may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially, and without either Fear or Corruption, examine that whole matter.</p>
            <p>If all theſe Matters are true in fact, then I ſuppoſe no Man will doubt, that the whole Foundations of this Government, and all the moſt ſacred Parts of it, are overturned. And as to the truth of all theſe Suppoſitions, that is left to every <hi>Engliſhman</hi>'s Judgment and Senſe.</p>

            <head>The Oath of SUPREMACY.</head>
            <p>I A. B. <hi>do utterly teſtify and declare in my Conſcience, that the Queen's High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the only Supream Governour of this Realm, and of all other her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs's Dominions and Countries, as well in all Spiritual or Eccleſiaſtical Things and Cauſes as Temporal; and that no Foreign Prince, Perſon, Prelate, State, or Potentate hath or ought to have any Juriſdiction, Power, Superiority, Preheminence or Authority, Eccleſiaſtical or Spiritual within this Realm; And therefore I do utterly renounce and forſake all Foreign Juriſdictions, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, Superiorities and Authorities, and do promiſe that from henceforth I ſhall bear Faith and true Allegiance to the Queen's Highneſs, her Heirs and lawful Succeſſors; and to my Power ſhall aſſiſt and defend all Juriſdictions, Priviledges, Preheminencies and Authorities, granted or belonging to the Queen's Highneſs, her Heirs and Succeſſors, or united and annexed to the Imperial Crown of this Realm. So help me God, and by the Contents of this Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="490" facs="tcp:48501:251"/>
            <p>It cannot but be obvious to every impartial Peruſer of the Statute, eſpecially if he have the leaſt knowledg of what Condition the Government of this Nation was reduced to by Papal Encroachments and Uſurpations, That the Makers of this Law, and the Senſe of this <hi>Oath,</hi> was no other in general, than that the People of this Realm ſhould <hi>bear Faith and true Allegiance,</hi> even in Matters relating to <q>Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction to the Queen's Highneſs, her Heirs and lawful Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and not to the Pope or any foreign pretended Juriſdiction.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What the ſeveral <q>Juriſdictions, Priviledges, Preheminences and Authorities, granted or belonging to the Queen, her Heirs and Succeſſors, are in particular; and what the Juriſdictions, Priviledges, Preheminences and Authorities, United and Annexed to the Imperial Crown of this Realm,</q> are in particular, is not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial here to be diſcourſed of; though the ſeveral Statutes made in <q>King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time,</q> and King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's, and revived in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s, will unfold many of them; and clear the diſtinction, which the <hi>OATH</hi> makes, betwixt <q>Authorities granted or belonging to the King, and Authorities united and annexed to the Imperial Crown; and Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi>'s Hiſtory of the Pope's into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Uſurpations upon the Liberties of the Kings and Subjects of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi>
               </q> together with <q>Sir <hi>Roger Twiſden</hi>'s Hiſtorical Vindication of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in point of Schiſm,</q> will in a great meaſure acquaint the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious how matters ſtood with us here, with reſpect to Church-Government, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pope had wreſted the Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction almoſt wholly out of the hands of our Kings, our Parliaments and Courts of Juſtice. In ſhort, thoſe Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſuch, as the Antient Laws, Cuſtoms, and Uſages of the Realm, or latter Acts of Parliament have Created, Given, Limited and Directed.</p>
            <p>The Makers of this Law did not deſign to impoſe upon the People of <hi>England</hi> any new Terms of Allegiance, but to ſecure the old ones, excluſive of any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the Pope or See of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor are there any words in this <hi>Oath</hi> more ſtrong, more binding to Duty and Allegiance, than are words which the old <hi>Oath of Fealty</hi> is conceived in; which all Men were antiently obliged, and may yet be required to take to the King in the Court-Leet at twelve years of Age; which runs thus; <hi>(viz.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>You ſhall ſwear that from this day forward you ſhall be true and faithful to our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lord King</hi> James <hi>and his Heirs: And Faith and Truth ſhall bear of Life and Limb, and terrene Honour. And you ſhall not know nor hear of any ill or damage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to him, that you ſhall not defend. So help you Almighty God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is as full and comprehenſive, as the Oath of Supremacy; <hi>I do promiſe that I ſhall bear faith and true Allegiance to the Queen's Highneſs, her Heirs and lawful Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and to my power ſhall aſſiſt and defend all Juriſdictions,</hi> &amp;c. So that the true ſenſe and meaning of the Oath of Supremacy, is this; viz. <hi>I will be true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to our Soveraign Lord the King, his Heirs and lawful Succeſſors, and will to my Power aſſiſt and defend all his Rights, notwithſtanding any pretence made by the Pope or any other Foreign Power to exerciſe Juriſdiction within the Realm, all which Foreign Power I utterly renounce in Matters Eccleſiaſtical as well as Temporal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> is appointed by the Act of 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. Intituled, <hi>An Act for diſcovering and repreſſing of Popiſh Recuſants.</hi> It recites <hi>the daily Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences that many of his Majeſty's Subjects, that adhere in their Hearts to the Popiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by the Infection drawn from thence, by the wicked and devilliſh Counſel of Jeſuits, Seminaries, and other like Perſons dangerous to the Church and State, are ſo far perverted in the point of their Loyalties and due Allegiance to the King's Majeſty, and the Crown of</hi> England, <hi>as they are ready to entertain and execute any Treaſonable Conſpiracies and Practices:</hi> And <hi>for the better Trial how his Majeſty's Subjects ſtand affected in point of their Loyalties and due Obedience,</hi> Enacts, that <hi>it ſhall be lawful for any Biſhop in his Dioceſs, or any two Juſtices of the Peace, whereof one to be of the</hi> Quorum, <hi>within the Limits of their Juriſdiction, out of the Seſſion, to require any Perſon of the age of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years or above, which ſhall be convict or indicted of Recuſancy, other than Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or which ſhall not have received the Sacrament twice within the Year then next paſt, or any Perſon paſſing in or through the Country, unknown, that being examined upon Oath ſhall confeſs, or not deny him or her ſelf to be a Recuſant, and to take the Oath therein after expreſſed;</hi> viz. &amp;c. <hi>The Oath of Allegiance.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="491" facs="tcp:48501:251"/>
            <p>So that by the occaſion of impoſing the <hi>Oath,</hi> and by the appointing it to be tendred only to Papiſts or ſuſpected Papiſts, it is apparent that the Deſign of the Law-makers was to detect ſuch Perſons as were perverted, or in danger to be perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their Loyalty, by Infection drawn from the <hi>Popiſh Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The form of the <hi>Oath</hi> makes it yet more evident, being wholly levell'd againſt any Opinion of the Lawfulneſs of depoſing the King, or practiſing any Treaſon againſt him, upon pretence of his being excommunicated or deprived by the Pope, and againſt any Opinion of the Pope's Power to diſcharge Subjects from their Oaths of Fidelity to their Princes. It runs thus; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> A. B. <hi>Do truly and ſincerely profeſs, teſtify and declare in my Conſcience before God and the World, that our Soveraign Lord King</hi> James, <hi>is lawful and rightful King of this Realm, and of all his Majeſty's Dominions and Countries: And that the Pope, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of himſelf, nor by any Authority of the Church or See of</hi> Rome, <hi>or by any other means, with any other, hath any Power or Authority to depoſe the King, or to diſpoſe any of his Majeſty's Kingdoms or Dominions, or to authorize any Foreign Prince to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade or annoy him, or his Countries, or to diſcharge any of his Subjects of their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or Obedience to his Majeſty, or to give licence or leave to any of them to bear Arms, raiſe Tumults, or to offer any Violence or Hurt to his Majeſty's Royal Perſon, State or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or to any of his Majeſty's Subjects within his Majeſty's Dominions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alſo I do ſwear from my Heart, that</hi> notwithſtanding any Declaration or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Excommunication, or Deprivation made or granted, or to be made or granted by the Pope or his Succeſſors, or by any Authority derived or pretended to be derived from him or his See, againſt the ſaid King, his Heirs and Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, or any Abſolution of the ſaid Subjects from their Obedience, <hi>I will bear Faith and true Allegiance to his Majeſty, his Heirs and Succeſſors, and him and them will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend to the uttermoſt of my Power againſt all Conſpiracies and Attempts whatſoever, which ſhall be made againſt his or their Perſons, their Crown and Dignity, by reaſon or colour of any ſuch Sentence or Declaration, or otherwiſe; and will do my beſt endeavour to diſcloſe and make known unto his Majeſty, his Heirs and Succeſſors, all Treaſons and traiterous Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies, which I ſhall know or hear of to be againſt him, or any of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I do further ſwear, that I do from my Heart abhor and deteſt and abjure, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and heretical, this damnable Doctrine and Poſition, That Princes which be</hi> excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated or deprived by the Pope, <hi>may be depoſed or murthered by their Subjects, or any other whatſoever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I do believe, and in Conſcience am perſwaded, that neither the Pope nor any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whatſoever, hath Power to abſolve me of this Oath, or any part thereof, which I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg by good and lawful Authority to be lawfully adminiſtred unto me, and I do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all Parſons and Diſpenſations to the contrary. And all theſe things I do plainly and ſincerely acknowledg and ſwear, according to theſe expreſs words by me ſpoken, and according to the plain and common Senſe and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of the ſame words, without any Equivocation, or mental Evaſion, or ſecret Reſervation whatſoever. And I do make this Recognition and Acknowledgment heartily, willingly and truly, upon the true Faith of a Chriſtian. So help me God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the Statute of</hi> 7 Jacobi <hi>cap.</hi> 6. recites; <q>
                  <hi>that</hi> Whereas by a Statute made in the third Year of the ſaid King's Reign, the form of an Oath to be miniſtred and given to certain Perſons in the ſame Act mentioned, is limited and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, tending only to the Declaration of ſuch Duty as every true and well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Subject, not only by bond of Allegiance, but alſo by the Commandment of Almighty God, ought to bear to the King, his Heirs and Succeſſors; Which Oath ſuch are <hi>infected with Popiſh Superſtition</hi> do oppugne with many falſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound Arguments, the juſt defence whereof the King had therefore undertaken and worthily performed, to the great contentment of all his Subjects, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Gainſayings of Contentious Adverſaries. And to ſhew how greatly the King's Loyal Subjects do approve the ſaid Oath, they beſeech his Majeſty, that the ſaid Oath be adminiſtred to all his Subjects.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Pope,</hi> and <hi>Authority of the See of</hi> Rome, run through the firſt Paragraph; <hi>Notwithſtanding any Declaration, or Sentence of Excommunication, &amp;c.</hi> Governs the ſecond Paragraph: <hi>Excommunicated and deprived the Pope</hi> are the material words in the third Paragraph. The fourth is added in <hi>Majorem cautelam,</hi> in oppoſition to the Popiſh Doctrine of <hi>Diſpenſing</hi> with Oaths, <hi>Abſolving Subjects</hi> from their <hi>Allegiance, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocations, Mental Evaſions,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="492" facs="tcp:48501:252"/>
            <p>So that as the <hi>Oath of Supremacy</hi> did but enforce the Antient <hi>Oath of Fealty,</hi> with an acknowledgment of the Queen's ſupream Authority in Eccleſiaſtial Cauſes and things, as well as Temporal, and a Renunciation of all Foreign Juriſdictions; ſo the <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> does but enforce the ſame old <hi>Oath of Fealty,</hi> by obliging the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> expreſly to diſown any lawful Authority in the Pope or See of <hi>Rome</hi> to depoſe, invade or annoy the King, his Dominions or Subjects. And <hi>notwithſtanding any Sentence of Excommunication, Deprivation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by the Pope,</hi> &amp;c. to bear Faith and true Allegiance to the King, his Heirs and lawful Succeſſors; And to abjure that Poſition, that it is lawful to depoſe Princes that are <hi>Excommunicated or Deprived by the Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever is added, is either <hi>Oath</hi> over and above what was expreſt in the old <hi>Oath of Fealty,</hi> is but as Explanatory of it, and branching it out into ſuch Particulars, as time and occaſion required.</p>
            <p>So that the <hi>Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance</hi> not having altered <hi>the terms of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,</hi> due from the People of <hi>England</hi> to their Princes, if their Princes by anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Laws of the Realm,</hi> and by <hi>the Practice of our Forefathers,</hi> were liable to be depoſed <hi>by the great Councils of the Nation,</hi> for <hi>Male-adminiſtration, Oppreſſions,</hi> and other <hi>Exorbitances,</hi> for not keeping their <hi>Coronation-Oaths,</hi> for <hi>Inſufficiency to govern,</hi> &amp;c. then they continue ſtill liable to be depoſed in like manner, the ſaid <hi>Oaths,</hi> or any Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation contracted thereby, notwithſtanding.</p>
            <p>For the Practice of former times, I ſhall begin with a very antient Precedent in the Kingdom of the <hi>Weſt-Saxons,</hi> (viz.)</p>
            <q>
               <p>

And when he evil entreated them all manner of ways, and either wreſted the Laws for his own Ends, or eluded them for his own Advantage; <hi>Cumbra</hi> one of his chief Officers, at the requeſt of the whole People, intimated their Complaints to the Savage King. And becauſe he perſuaded the King to govern his People more mildly, and that laying aſide his Barbarity, he would endeavour to appear acceptable to God and Man; the King immediately commanded him to be put to Death, and increaſing his Tyranny, became more cruel and intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than before: whereupon in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſecond Year of his Reign, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was arriv'd to an incorrigible pitch of Pride and Wickedneſs, the NOBLES and the PEOPLE OF THE WHOLE KING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOM aſſembled together, and upon MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURE DELIBERATION, did by UNA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIMOUS CONSENT OF THEM ALL, drive him out of the Kingdom.

               <p>The King, becauſe he is the Vicar of the Supream King, is conſtituted to this end and purpoſe, that he may govern his earthly Kingdom and the People of the Lord, and eſpecially to govern and reverence God's holy Church, and defend it from Injuries, and root out, deſtroy, and wholly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate all Wrong-doers.

He ought alſo to preſerve, to cheriſh, maintain, govern and defend againſt its Adverſaries, the Church within his Kingdom entirely and in all freedom, according to the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Fathers and of his Predeceſſors, that God may be honoured above all things, and always be had before Men's Eyes.

For which Cauſes, when after many Applications made, War was waged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him by his Barons; at laſt, amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things it was agreed, with his expreſs Conſent, that in caſe the ſaid <hi>John</hi> ſhould return to his former Villanies, <hi>the Barons ſhould be at liberty to recede from their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to him,</hi> never to return to him more. But he, after a few days, made his latter end worſe than his beginning, endeavouring not only to oppreſs his Barons, but wholly to exterminate them; who therefore in a GENERAL ASSEMBLY, and with the APPROBATION of ALL THE REALM, adjudging him unworthy to be King, choſe US for their Lord and King. <hi>Collect. p.</hi> 1868, 1869. <hi>Chron.</hi> W.

               <p>It is accorded that Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> the King's eldeſt Son, ſhall have the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Kingdom, and be crowned King for the Cauſes following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For that the Perſon of the King is inſufficient to govern: for that during his whole Reign he has been led and governed by others, who have given him evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, to his Diſhonour, and the Deſtruction of Holy-Church, and of all his People; he being unwilling to conſider or know what was good or evil, or to provide remedy, even when it was required of him by the great and wiſe Men of his Realm, or ſuffer any to be made.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Alſo, during all his time, he would neither hearken to, nor believe good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, nor apply himſelf to the good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Realm, but hath always given himſelf over to Things and Occupations altogether inconvenient, omitting in the mean time the neceſſary Affairs and Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Alſo, For want of good Government, he hath loſt the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and other Lands and Territories in <hi>Gaſcoin</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which his Father left him in peace and friendſhip with the <hi>French</hi> King, and with many other Grandees.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Alſo, By his Pride and Arrogance and evil Counſel, he has deſtroyed Holy-Church, impriſoning ſome Perſons thereof, and put others in diſtreſs. And alſo he hath put to a ſhameful death, impriſoned and diſinherited many of the great Men, and Nobles of the Land.</p>
               <pb n="495" facs="tcp:48501:253"/>
               <p n="5">5. Alſo, Whereas he is bound by his Oath to adminiſter Juſtice to all, he would not do it, through his own Covetouſneſs, and that of Evil Counſellors, that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him; neither hath he kept the other Points of the Oath, which he took at his Coronation, as he was bound.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Alſo, He hath waſted his Kingdom, and did what in him lay, that his Realm and People ſhould be deſtroy'd; and, which is worſe, by his Cruelty and perſonal Failings or Defects, he is found to be incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible, and paſt all hopes of amendment. All which things are ſo notorious, that they cannot be denied.</p>

               <p>Sir, <hi>The Lords, and all the Commons of your Parliament,</hi> have themſelves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to your moſt excellent Majeſty, deſiring the Succeſs of your invincible Honour againſt the Power of your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and a moſt firm Bond of Peace and Love in your Heart towards your Subjects, for your good God-wards, and the good of your Soul, and to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Comfort of all your People whom you govern: On whoſe behalf we intimate theſe things to you; That it appears to us <hi>by an antient Statute, and
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:48501:254"/>by laudable and approved <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage, which cannot be deny'd,</hi> that our King can call together the Peers of the Realm, and the Commons, once a year to his Parliament, as to the ſupream Court of the whole Kingdom, in which all Right and Juſtice ought to ſhine forth without any doubt or ſtain, as the Sun at Noon-day, where Poor and Rich may find an infallible Refuge, to enjoy the Refreſhments of Tranquillity and Peace, and for repelling of Injuries; where alſo Errors in Government are to be reformed, and the State and Government of King and Kingdom treated upon by ſage Advice, and the deſtroying and repelling of both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine and foreign Enemies to the King and Kingdom, with moſt Convenience and Honour, may be debated upon, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for; as alſo in what manner the Charges incumbent upon the King and Kingdom may be born with moſt eaſe to the Commonalty. They conceive likewiſe, that ſince they bear the incumbent Charges, it concerns them to inſpect how and by whom their Goods and Chattels are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended. They ſay alſo, that it appears to them by an <hi>antient Statute,</hi> that if the King abſent himſelf from his Parliament volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, not by reaſon of Sickneſs, or for any other neceſſary cauſe, but through an inordinate Will ſhall wantonly abſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the ſpace of forty days, as not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the Vexation of his People, and their great Expences, it ſhall then be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to all and ſingular of them to return to their own Homes without the King's leave: And you have now been longer abſent, and have refuſed to come to them, for what cauſe they know not. <hi>Then ſaid the King,</hi> I now plainly ſee that my People and the Commons deſign to oppoſe me with Force, and are about to make an Inſurrection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me: And <hi>if I be ſo infeſted, I think the beſt courſe I can take will be to <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

To which they reply'd, That Counſel is not for your good, but will inevitably tend to your ruin; for the King of</hi> France <hi>is your capital Enemy, and the greateſt Adverſary that your Kingdom has, and if he ſhould ſet his foot within your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he would rather endeavour to prey upon you, and invade your Realm, and to depoſe you from your Royal Dignity, than afford you any Aſſiſtance, if, which God forbid, you ſhould ſtand in need of his help.</hi> Call to mind therefore, how your Grand-father King <hi>Edward</hi> III, and your Father Prince <hi>Edward</hi> for him, fought indefatigably in Sweat and Sorrow all their days, and went through innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Hardſhips of Cold and Heat, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> which by he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:48501:254"/>Right appertain'd to Them, and does now to You by Succeſſion after them. Remember likewiſe, how innumerable Lords and Commons of both Realms, and Kings and Gentlemen of other Kingdoms, and People innumerable, periſhed, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded periſhing, in that War; and that the Commons of this Realm pour'd out Goods of ineſtimable value, and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sums of Money, for the carrying on of that ſame War; and, which is more to be lamented, they have now in your days undergone ſuch heavy Taxes towards the maintaining of your Wars, that they are reduced to ſuch incredible Poverty, that they cannot ſo much as pay their Rents for their Farms, nor aid the King, nor afford themſelves Neceſſaries; and the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is impoveriſh'd, and the Lords become uneaſy, and all the People faint; for a King cannot become poor, that has a rich Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; nor can he be rich, whoſe People are poor. And all theſe Miſchiefs redound not to the King only, but alſo to all and ſingular the Peers of the Realm, in proportion: And all theſe Miſchiefs happen by means of the King's Evil Miniſters, who have hitherto miſgovern'd both the King and Kingdom; and if ſome courſe be not taken, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England</hi> will be miſerably dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd ſooner than we are aware. But there remains yet another part of our Meſſage, which we have to impart to you on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of your People. They find in an <hi>antient Statute,</hi> and it has been done in fact not long ago, That if the King, through any Evil Counſel, or fooliſh Contumacy, or out of Scorn, or ſome ſingular petulant Will of his own, or by any other irregular Means, ſhall alienate himſelf from his People, and ſhall <hi>refuſe to be govern'd and guided by the Laws of the Realm, and the Statutes and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ordinances thereof,</hi> together with the wholſom Advice of the Lords and great Men of his Realm, but perſiſting head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong in his own hare-brain'd Counſels, ſhall petulantly proſecute his own ſingular humour, That then <hi>it ſhall be lawful for them, with the common aſſent and conſent of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Realm, to depoſe that ſame King from his Regal Throne, and to ſet up ſome other of the Royal Blood in his room.</hi> H. Knight. Coll. 2681.</p>
            </q>
            <p>No Man can imagine that the <hi>Lords and Commons in Parliament</hi> would have ſent the King ſuch a Meſſage, and have quoted to him an old <hi>Statute for depoſing Kings</hi> that would not govern according to Law, if the People of <hi>England</hi> had then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended that an Obedience <hi>without reſerve</hi> was due to the King, or if there had not been ſuch a Statute in being. And though the Record of that <hi>Excellent Law</hi> be loſt, as the Records of almoſt all our Antient Laws are; yet is the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of ſo credible an Hiſtorian, who lived when theſe things were tranſacted, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to inform us, that ſuch a Law was then known and in being, and conſequently that the <hi>Terms of Engliſh Allegiance,</hi> according to the <hi>Conſtitution of our Government,</hi> are different from what ſome Modern Authors would perſuade us they are.</p>
            <pb n="498" facs="tcp:48501:255"/>
            <p>This Difference betwixt the ſaid King and his Parliament ended amicably betwixt them, in the puniſhment of many Evil Counſellors, by whom the King had been influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to commit many <hi>Irregularities in Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Diſcontents of the People grew higher by his After-management of Affairs, and ended in the <hi>Depoſition</hi> of that <hi>King,</hi> and ſetting up of another, who was not the next Heir in <hi>Lineal Succeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Articles againſt King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second may be read at large in <hi>H.

An Abridgment of them is in <hi>Cotton's Records,</hi> pag. 386, 387, 388. out of whom I obſerve theſe few, there being in all Thirty three.</p>
            <p>The Firſt was, <hi>His waſting and beſtowing the Lands of the Crown upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Perſons, and overcharging the Commons with Exactions. And that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as certain Lords Spiritual and Temporal, were aſſign'd in Parliament to intend the Government of the Kingdom, the King by a Conventicle of his own Accomplices endeavoured to impeach them of High-Treaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another was, <hi>For that the King by undue means procured divers Juſtices to ſpeak againſt the Law, to the deſtruction of the Duke of</hi> Gloceſter, <hi>and the Earls of</hi> Arundel <hi>and</hi> Warwick <hi>at</hi> Shrewsbury.</p>
            <p>Another, <hi>For that the King, againſt his own Promiſe and Pardon at a ſolemn Proceſſion, apprehended the Duke of</hi> Gloceſter, <hi>and ſent him to</hi> Calice, <hi>there to be choaked and murthered, beheading the Earl of</hi> Arundel, <hi>and baniſhing the Earl of</hi> Warwick, <hi>and the Lord</hi> Cobham.</p>
            <p>Another, <hi>For that the King's Retinue, and a Rout gathered by him out of</hi> Cheſhire, <hi>committed divers Murders, Rapes, and other Felonies, and refuſed to pay for their Victuals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another, <hi>For that the Crown of</hi> England <hi>being freed from the Pope, and all other Foreign Power, the King notwithſtanding procured the Pope's Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation on ſuch as ſhould break the Ordinances of the laſt Parliament, in derogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Crown, Statutes and Laws of the Realm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another, <hi>That he made Men Sheriffs, who were not named to him by the Great Officers, the Juſtices and others of his Council; and who were unfit, contrary to the Laws of the Realm, and in manifeſt breach of his Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another, <hi>For that he did not repay to his Subjects the Debts that he had bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another, <hi>For that the King refuſed to execute the Laws, ſaying, That the Laws were in his Mouth and Breaſt, and that himſelf alone could make and alter the Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another, <hi>For cauſing Sheriffs to continue in Office above a Year, contrary to the tenor of a Statute-Law, thereby incurring notorious Perjury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another, <hi>For that the ſaid King procured Knights of the Shires to be return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſerve his own Will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another, <hi>For that many Juſtices, for their good Counſel given to the King, were with evil Countenance and Threats rewarded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another, <hi>For that the King paſſing into</hi> Ireland, <hi>had carried with him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Conſent of the Eſtates of the Realm, the Treaſure, Reliques, and other Jewels of the Realm, which were uſed ſafely to be kept in the King's own Coffers from all hazard; And for that the ſaid King cancelled and razed ſundry Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another, <hi>For that the ſaid King appear'd by his Letters to the Pope, to Foreign Princes, and to his Subjects, ſo variable, ſo diſſembling, and ſo unfaithful and inconſtant, that no Man could truſt him, that knew him; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that he was a Scandal both to himſelf and the Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another, <hi>That the King would commonly ſay amongſt the Nobles, that all Subjects Lives, Lands and Goods were in his hands without any forfeiture; which is altogether contrary to the Laws and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſages of the Realm.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="499" facs="tcp:48501:255"/>
            <p>Another, <hi>For that he ſuffered his Subjects to be condemned by Martial-Law, contrary to his Oath, and the Laws of the Realm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another, <hi>For that whereas the Subjects of</hi> England <hi>are ſufficiently bound to the King by their Allegiance, yet the ſaid King compell'd them to take new Oaths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Articles, with ſome others, not altogether of ſo general a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, being conſidered, and the King himſelf confeſſing his Defects, the ſame ſeemed ſufficient to the <hi>whole Eſtates</hi> for the <hi>King's Depoſition,</hi> and he was depos'd accordingly.</p>
            <p>The Subſtance and Drift of all is, That our Kings were antiently liable to, and might lawfully be depoſed for <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> and <hi>Tyranny,</hi> for <hi>Inſufficiency to govern,</hi> &amp;c. in and by the great Council of the Nation, without any breach of the old <hi>Oath of Fealty;</hi> becauſe (to ſay nothing of the nature of our <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi>) expreſs and poſitive Laws warranted ſuch Proceedings: And therefore, the Frame of our <hi>Government</hi> being the ſame ſtill, and the <hi>Terms of our Allegiance</hi> being the ſame now that they were then, without any new Obligations ſuperinduced by the <hi>Oaths of Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> a King of <hi>England</hi> may legally at this day, for ſufficient cauſe, be depoſed by the <hi>Lords and Commons</hi> aſſembled in a <hi>Great Council of the Kingdom,</hi> without any breach of the preſent <hi>Oaths of Supremacy or Allegiance.
